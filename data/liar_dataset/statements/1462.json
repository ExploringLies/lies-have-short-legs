Kay Bailey Hutchison, seeking the Republican nomination for governor, unleashed a TV commercial Feb. 4 casting Gov. Rick Perry as beholden to special interests and lobbyists, including two who served as his top gubernatorial assistants.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe ad flashes what look like seven ominous newspaper headlines about Perry before a narrator says: &quot;There are two ways to get things done in Austin. Hire a lobbyist and donate to this governor. Or elect a new one.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered if Hutchison&rsquo;s &quot;New One&quot; ad accurately reflected original headlines and news stories. (For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are focusing on Hutchison&#39;s use of the headlines &mdash; a common campaign technique. We are not assessing the accuracy of those articles or her overall Perry critique.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHutchison spokesman Joe Pounder initially said every headline in the ad matched original published headlines. He later said the ad presents &quot;pull quotes,&quot; meaning excerpts from articles and not necessarily the original headlines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing Nexis, an electronic news retrieval service, we found that four of the quotations presented in Hutchison&rsquo;s ad were identical to published headlines on news stories. Hutchison&rsquo;s campaign showed that a fifth also was correct. The correctly quoted headlines are: &quot;Perry to Name Lobbyist As New Chief of Staff;&quot; &quot;Lobbyists Revolving In, Out of Perry Staff Positions;&quot; &quot;Perry Shakes Down Special Interests, Lobbyists;&quot; &quot;Companies That Gave to Perry Got Road Contract;&quot; and &quot;Perry&rsquo;s Top Donors Get Business.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe noticed, though, that the headline about Perry shaking down special interests topped an editorial&mdash;not a news story&mdash;published in <em>The Houston Chronicle</em> about Perry in July 2000. At the time, Perry was lieutenant governor. He succeeded George W. Bush as governor in late 2000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Chronicle </em>editorial questioned a Perry letter asking lobbyists to buy $1,000 tickets to an upcoming political fund-raiser. Perry, the newspaper opined, &quot;has just made it abundantly clear that he knows no bounds when it comes to shaking down special interests with business before the Texas Legislature.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the editorial, Perry&#39;s letter asked lobbyists to specify how much money each of their corporate and group clients would be sending the lieutenant governor&#39;s way&mdash;potentially fostering illegal corporate donations or encouraging lobbyists to see links between donations and state business, the newspaper said. &quot;With his latest fund-raising letter holding legislative lobbyists responsible for money contributed by their clients, Perry explicitly links campaign money to business before the Legislature,&quot; the editorial states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo of the headline-like quotations in Hutchison&rsquo;s ad were not previously published headlines on news articles: &quot;Perry&rsquo;s Former Chief of Staff is A Lobbyist for Merck&quot; and &quot;A Shroud of Secrecy Has Descended on the Governor&rsquo;s Office.&quot; (The published headlines for those articles: &quot;Reluctant governor yields on HPV shots; Calling a veto useless, Perry chides legislators for reversing his vaccination order&quot; and &quot;Perry refusal to release memo nothing new, He cites attorney-client privilege, this time in the execution controversy.&quot;)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe confirmed, though, that the two quotations presented to look like headlines accurately reflected portions of the related news articles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s not unusual for campaign ads to present excerpts from newspaper stories as a stream of headlines. It&rsquo;s also not rare for a candidate to quote an editorial as news reportage, even though editorials are opinion pieces.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, a voter could conclude that Hutchison&rsquo;s ad consists entirely of genuine clear-cut news headlines. That&rsquo;s not so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe give her use of the headlines a rating of Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-04T16:55:08.921527", "ruling_date": "2010-02-04T16:54:08", "ruling_headline": "Kay Bailey Hutchison ad pours out headlines casting Gov.
