John Nygren (R-Marinette) who called WEDC a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/board-members-of-troubled-jobs-agency-reach-for-solutions-p09sjm5-206599541.html\">&quot;proven job creator.&quot;</a>&nbsp;The audit found record-keeping is lacking, but employers in Nygren&rsquo;s northeastern Wisconsin district said that they added jobs after receiving tax credits and other assistance from the agency.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what each report cited by Larson says:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWEDC report: <a href=\"http://inwisconsin.com/content/uploads/2013/02/2012-Annual-Report.pdf\">The report</a> covers the first year of the agency. When it comes to measuring effectiveness, it looks to the future.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;A total of 23,759 jobs in Wisconsin are anticipated to be impacted directly by investments made by WEDC in FY12,&quot; the report says. That means the agency expects that number of people will be hired in the future by companies that have received assistance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn all, WEDC made 287 &quot;awards&quot; worth $500 million to state employers in the first year of operation, the report said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLegislative Audit Bureau:<a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/13-7highlights.pdf\">The bureau&rsquo;s </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/13-7highlights.pdf\">report</a>said the agency had poor record keeping, sloppy internal practices and gave awards to ineligible businesses and projects. Additionally, &nbsp;it noted WEDC has experienced severe staffing turnover, including with top leadership.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe audit said record-keeping was so sloppy, they were unable to include a job count in their review: &quot;The report WEDC submitted in November 2012 did not contain all required information, contained some inaccurate information, and did not clearly present information about the number of jobs created and retained as a result of its programs. For these reasons, and in the absence of verified performance information, we did not assess the effectiveness of WEDC&rsquo;s economic development programs.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut there is a difference in calculating an accurate total number of jobs and -- as Larson claimed -- not being able to account for a single one. What&rsquo;s more, there are the accounting standards applied in by auditors, and there is the understanding most would be left with after hearing Larson&rsquo;s remark: That WEDC has nothing to show for its work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn reviewing the Nygren claim, we looked at several companies in his district that said they added workers after receiving tax credits and other help from WEDC.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThose three companies -- Precision Ice Blasting Corp., Vargo Tool &amp; Die Corp. and Marinette Marine, say they added a total of 1,022 jobs of a promised a total of 1,076 in exchange for $28.46 million in tax credits.Under the agreements, they don&rsquo;t get the credits unless they can show the jobs were created.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo, it&rsquo;s clear that WEDC has provided tax credits and helped companies win additional work and hire more people. It&rsquo;s just not clear what the overall score card actually reads.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLarson said the state&rsquo;s signature jobs agency &quot;cannot account for creating one single job.&quot; Larson&rsquo;s correct in that the agency, or a critical audit, can&rsquo;t quantify its effectiveness.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut Larson&rsquo;s statement suggests no businesses have been assisted by WEDC. And there&rsquo;s plenty of evidence that&rsquo;s not the case, starting with the employers in northeastern Wisconsin.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOur definition for Mostly False is: &quot;The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.&quot; That fits here.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-18T16:14:52.263949", "ruling_date": "2013-06-20T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
