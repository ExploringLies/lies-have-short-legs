Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature for an &quot;ideological attack on higher education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"http://wisdems.org/news/blog/view/2013-09-back-to-school\"><u>article</u></a> posted Sept. 18, 2013 on the party&rsquo;s website made a number of charges, including one about the Wisconsin Technical College System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2013-&rsquo;15 state budget, the party declared, &quot;left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1989 reference would mean state funding for tech schools is the same as it was when the parents of today&rsquo;s students were on campus. It was a repeat of a <a href=\"http://wisdems.org/news/press/view/2013-04-fact-check-self-serving-scott-walker-editorial-ignor\"><u>claim</u></a> the party had made before, and a statistic we alluded to in an <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/05/fred-clark/democratic-state-rep-fred-clark-says-gov-scott-wal/\"><u>item</u></a> in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s see if the folks on the left are right about the folks on the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Overall tech school funding</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s 16 technical colleges serve some <a href=\"http://www.wtcsystem.edu/reports/data/factbook/pdf/headcount.pdf\"><u>360,000</u></a> Wisconsinites per year -- those taking a class here and there as well as those seeking a two-year diploma or other credential. Based on a 2007 <a href=\"http://wistax.org/docs/facts/wtcs.pdf\"><u>study</u></a> by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, the system has an economic impact of about $7 billion per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we dig into the fact check, it&rsquo;s important to know that state money makes up a relatively small portion of the tech schools&rsquo; overall funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technical colleges get their money primarily from three sources, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. In 2011-&rsquo;12, the <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2013-15%20Budget/Documents/Budget%20Papers/725.pdf\"><u>latest figures available</u></a>, those three sources accounted for $1.15 billion -- two-thirds ($771.3 million) from property taxes, one-fourth ($279 million) from tuition and fees, and 9 percent ($101.2 million) from the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the $101 million in state money, $83.5 million was unrestricted -- and is known as general state aid -- while the rest was earmarked for certain purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, any reduction in state aid wouldn&rsquo;t affect the lion&rsquo;s share of the tech schools&rsquo; overall funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the claim we&rsquo;re testing focuses on the state budget and how much of it goes to tech schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>State funding of tech schools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back its claim, the Democratic Party cited a state budget document and legislative <a href=\"http://www.witc.edu/witccontent/pdfs%20-%20advocacy/DC%20copy%20-%20Joint%20Finance.pdf\"><u>testimony</u></a> that show general state aid -- the unrestricted funds -- was $85 million for the 1988-&rsquo;89 budget year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since that time, general state aid to the tech schools has trended upward. It reached $119 million in 2010-&rsquo;11, the final budget year before Walker took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Walker&rsquo;s first budget, for 2011-&rsquo;13, imposed a 30 percent cut -- nearly $72 million over two years -- in general state aid to the tech schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tech schools cite a Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimate, however, that they were able to recoup at least 70 percent of the cut. They did so primarily by taking advantage of Walker&rsquo;s 2011 collective bargaining law and requiring employees to pay more toward their health care and pensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democrats&rsquo; claim, however, referred to Walker&rsquo;s second state budget, for 2013-&rsquo;15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That budget keeps general state aid to the tech schools at $83.5 million for the first year, but raises it to $88.5 million the second year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the current budget provides an average of $86 million per year in general state aid to the technical colleges -- virtually the same as the $85 million in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker spokesman Tom Evenson took issue with the measure singled out by the Democrats, saying all state aid -- not just the unrestricted general aid portion -- should be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total state aid is $108 million in the first year of the current budget and $113 million in the second, exceeding total state aid of $93.5 million in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budget experts we spoke to said either measure -- total state aid cited by Walker&rsquo;s office or the general aid portion cited by the Democrats -- is valid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, neither takes inflation into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had general state aid kept pace with inflation over the years, the $85 million allocated in 1989 would have been $160 million in 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; consumer price index <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=85%2C000&amp;year1=1989&amp;year2=2013\"><u>calculator</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wisconsin Democratic Party said the current, 2013-&rsquo;15 state budget adopted by Walker and Republican lawmakers &quot;left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s correct for the unrestricted general aid portion of state funding, which is the part the Republicans dramatically cut in the previous state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, total state aid in the current budget is higher than it was in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-is-the-gop-funding-tech-colleges-at-1989-levels-b99106880z1-225248872.html\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-09-25T14:21:50.948151", "ruling_date": "2013-09-26T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP state leaders funding tech schools at 1989 levels, Democratic Party says", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-state-leaders-funding-tech-schools-1989-levels", "ruling_link_text": "By one measure, yes; by another, no", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Democratic Party, <a href=\"http://wisdems.org/news/blog/view/2013-09-back-to-school\"><u>&quot;Back to School,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email interview, Wisconsin Democratic Party communications director Melissa Baldauff, Sept. 20 and 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Gov.
