The Rowan County official drew an ardent following when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

(The U.S. Supreme Court does have the final word on constitutional issues.) At the heart of this post is the claim that the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That comparison falls wide of the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Judge Tonya Parker</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parker was elected to the 116th Judicial District Court of Texas in 2010. She was the first openly homosexual person elected to a judgeship in Dallas County, and in 2012, she said in a speech that she was refusing to perform marriage ceremonies until same-sex couples gained the same rights as their opposite-sex counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t perform marriage ceremonies because we are in a state that does not have marriage equality and until it does, I&#39;m not going to partially apply the law to one group of people that doesn&#39;t apply to another group of people,&quot; Parker told a meeting of the Stonewall Democrats of Dallas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parker later explained in an email to news organizations that &quot;I do not, and would never, impede any person&#39;s right to get married.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She simply declined to conduct marriage ceremonies herself. Given that at that time, the only legal marriages in Texas were between opposite-sex couples, de facto, Parker was refusing to marry heterosexuals. We should note that she didn&rsquo;t single out such couples. They were the only ones she had the opportunity not to officiate over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to news reports, Parker faced no official sanctions as a result of her policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that put her in the same boat as Davis? No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Judges and clerks play different roles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The side-by-side comparison treats judges and clerks as if they play the same role in the marriage process. That&#39;s not true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is the responsibility of clerks to issue marriage licenses, judges do not share&nbsp;that obligation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, judges don&rsquo;t marry people, said&nbsp;Alexandra Albright, who teaches Texas civil procedure at the University of Texas at Austin Law School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They can perform marriages in Texas, but it&rsquo;s not their job,&quot; Albright said. &quot;Most judges I know marry people they know. It&rsquo;s a thing they do for friends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Albright said a judge like Parker is expected to spend her time presiding over lawsuits brought before her. When it comes to marriage ceremonies, the <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.2.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Texas code</u></a> authorizes a range of people to officiate. The list includes clergy, a designated officer of any religious organization, a variety of judges, justices of the peace<strong>,</strong> and retired judges and justices of the peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, a clerk like Davis holds a unique gatekeeper position in the marriage process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You can&rsquo;t get married without a marriage license,&quot; Albright said. &quot;There all kinds of people who can perform wedding ceremonies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A conservative group on Facebook said the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis.&nbsp;The comparison fails because a judge in Texas and a clerk in Kentucky play different official roles in the marriage process. Texas law authorizes many people, including judges, to perform marriages. Doing so is optional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Kentucky, couples must have a marriage license issued by a clerk to get married. Davis&rsquo;&nbsp;refusal shut the door on marriage for same-sex couples, at least in her county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-14T09:57:56.832171", "ruling_date": "2015-09-14T12:03:19", "ruling_headline": "Conservative Facebook post faults lesbian Texas judge for refusing to perform heterosexual marriages", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservative-facebook-post-faults-lesbian-texas-ju", "ruling_link_text": "Judges and clerks have different jobs", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Conservative News Today, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday/photos/a.183567061687283.37146.169204449790211/993918657318782/?type=1&amp;theater\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Facebook post</u></a>, Sept. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/gay-texas-judge-refuses-perform-marriage-ceremonies/story?id=15784189\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gay Texas Judge Refuses to Perform Marriage Ceremonies</u></a>, Feb. 24, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dallas County, <a href=\"http://www.dallascounty.org/department/courts/civildistrictcourts/116th/bio.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>116th Judicial District Court - Judge Biography</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>State of Texas, <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.2.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Family code: Sec. 2.202</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dallas Voice, <a href=\"http://www.dallasvoice.com/judge-parker-refuses-conduct-marriages-cant-performed-me-10102160.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gay Dallas judge won&rsquo;t conduct marriages because they &lsquo;can&rsquo;t be performed for me&rsquo;</u></a>, Feb. 22, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/us/kim-davis-same-sex-marriage.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kim Davis Takes Break From Work, but Commotion Goes On</u></a>, Sept. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Alexandra Albright, senior lecturer, School of Law, University of Texas at Austin, Sept. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3275, "last_name": "Viral image", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "viral-image", "pants_count": 27, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Success-Kid.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3275/", "total_count": 52, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Facebook post", "statement_date": "2015-09-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 118, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/118/", "subject": "Gays and Lesbians", "subject_slug": "gays-and-lesbians", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 9, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/9/", "subject": "Religion", "subject_slug": "religion", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
