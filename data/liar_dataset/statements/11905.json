Or at least that&rsquo;s what a Facebook post says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Readers shared with us this picture that features Mark Cuban, a <a href=\"https://www.theadvocates.org/libertarianism-101/libertarian-celebrities/mark-cuban/\">self-described libertarian</a> and <em>Sharknado 3</em> <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/07/what-a-trigger-happy-mark-cuban-kill-a-bunch-of-sharks-in-sharknado-3\">president of the United States</a>, saying, &quot;I worry that millions of millennials are voting Democrat this year because they fact-check everything and they know Republicans are completely out of touch and are running a campaign of hatred and lies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love shoutouts to fact-checking, but this post needs its own facts checked. We can&rsquo;t find any evidence, anywhere, that Cuban said this or anything like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We scoured the Internet, news archives, Cuban&rsquo;s blog and social media accounts, but we didn&rsquo;t find anything that matches the quote paired with this picture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were able to reach Cuban over Twitter, asking him if this is something he ever said. He <a href=\"http://[2/12/16, 4:38 PM] Lauren Carroll (laurenfc92@gmail.com): https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/698252843367690240\">replied</a>, &quot;No.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We traced the image <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/565145320196095/photos/pb.565145320196095.-2207520000.1455294882./1022452994465323/?type=3&amp;theater\">to a post on a Facebook page </a>called &quot;Point Counter Point,&quot; which bills itself as &quot;responding to Republican lies.&quot; We reached out to the page administrator via Facebook message to see how they came up with this quote but have yet to hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find a recent instance in which Cuban discussed why millennials seem to support Democrats, particularly Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the same post, he criticizes Republicans alongside Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Millennials like Sanders because they believe in &quot;sociocapitalism&quot; rather than just capitalism, meaning they expect businesses to have some sort of charitable element and inclusive practices, <a href=\"http://blogmaverick.com/2016/02/08/some-thoughts-on-the-presidential-race-and-sociocapitalism/\">Cuban wrote on his blog</a>, &quot;Maverick Blog: Mark Cuban&rsquo;s Weblog,&quot; on Feb. 8. He&rsquo;s noticed this trend through his experience listening to business pitches from 20-somethings as an investor on ABC&rsquo;s <em>Shark Tank</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So how can it be a surprise that millennials are excited about Bernie Sanders?&quot; he wrote. &quot;Millennials expect capitalism to reflect a socialist element.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wrote that no candidate in either party has shown a single instance of leadership; rather, they are too focused on conforming to party principles. They&rsquo;re all also &quot;technologically illiterate&quot; and unprepared to handle the country&rsquo;s growing technological needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his post did not reference fact-checking, nor did he say Republicans are &quot;running a campaign of hatred and lies.&quot; If we find a verified instance of him saying what the post alleges, we will revisit the fact-check.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuban remains an undecided voter, as far as we can tell. <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/02/01/billionaire-mark-cuban-says-hes-open-to-all-gop-candidates-except-one/\">He has said, though</a>, that he wants &quot;anybody but&quot; Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/28/mark-cuban-summarized-donald-trumps-appeal-in-just-43-words/\">he thinks fellow billionaire Donald Trump</a> is shaking up politics in a good way because he speaks his mind and doesn&rsquo;t just play to the base of the Republican Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuban has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/08/12/mark-cuban-would-love-to-be-a-republican-if-it-werent-for-the-republican-party/\">said he shares Republicans&rsquo; desire</a> for small government, but disagrees with many of their social positions. Cuban <a href=\"http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2012/05/mark-cuban-tells-nightline-that-hes-happy-to-pay-taxes-and-that-obama-has-done-a-lot-of-things-wrong.html/\">says he voted for</a> President Barack Obama in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Facebook post quotes Mark Cuban as saying,&nbsp;&quot;I worry that millions of millennials are voting Democrat this year because they fact-check everything.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence Cuban ever said that.
