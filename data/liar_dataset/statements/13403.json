When we shined a light on the measure, we found Amendment 1 doesn&rsquo;t provide any new protections, for seniors or anyone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Solar support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters of the Amendment 1 campaign say the constitutional change promotes solar while protecting consumers. Critics have derided the amendment, accusing organizers of obscuring their true, backdoor intention of helping established utilities <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/oct/21/al-gore/utilities-behind-amendment-1-are-trying-trick-vote/\">control Florida&rsquo;s solar market</a> and punish electric consumers for using solar panels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does the amendment protect seniors, or anyone else? On its own, Amendment 1 doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the wording says is that current consumer protections can remain in place. Along with saying people may still buy solar panels and install them, the measure reads (emphasis ours):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<strong>State and local governments shall retain their abilities to protect consumer rights and public health, safety and welfare,</strong> and to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second half concerns the future of net metering, in which solar customers sell excess electricity back to the utilities. Net metering is currently overseen by <a href=\"https://www.flrules.org/gateway/RuleNo.asp?ID=25-6.065\">Florida Public Service Commission rules</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the first half essentially says the amendment will not preclude any current or future state law or regulation. No legal protections would change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This provision makes clear that regardless of what course Florida takes with solar energy now or in the future, government will not relinquish its responsibility to protect consumers,&quot; a Consumers for Smart Solar spokeswoman told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn&rsquo;t give any examples when we asked them how solar customers may currently be protected. The attorney general&rsquo;s office said consumers with specific problems can file a complaint with them under the <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0500-0599/0501/0501PARTIIContentsIndex.html\">Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act</a>. The office reviews each complaint for appropriate action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have noticed the amendment does not spell out special protection for seniors. But here&rsquo;s where Consumers for Smart Solar&rsquo;s argument comes in. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They cited an <a href=\"http://www.citizen.org/documents/federal-trade-commission-comments-solar-consumer-protections-august-2016.pdf\">August 2016 letter</a> to the Federal Trade Commission from Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy group. The letter said Public Citizen hoped the FTC would consider new regulations on &quot;arrangements in which consumers lease their solar system from a corporate third-party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida is one of five states that do not allow a property owner to have a third-party installer put solar panels on their roof and sell the power back to them. In those deals, customers sign a lease for a period of time, usually a number of years, agreeing to buy power from the solar company. Florida customers are still allowed to lease the panels themselves, as long as they don&rsquo;t sell the excess electricity to anyone, such as a landlord selling power to tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumers for Smart Solar pointed to Arizona, where solar companies <a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-brnovich-obtains-settlement-solar-lawsuit\">bilked older customers</a> who didn&rsquo;t fully understand their lease agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not clear how this applies to Florida, because those kinds of deals aren&rsquo;t allowed in this state. State law makes it so that someone generating electricity with solar panels can&rsquo;t sell it to anyone but utility companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The net metering clause matters here, too, because third-party companies in other states depend on the money they would get from selling electricity to utilities. The amendment would conceivably make that business model unworkable, were third-party sales ever allowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida&#39;s two largest utilities, Florida Power &amp; Light and Duke Energy <a href=\"http://www.psc.state.fl.us/Files/PDF/Utilities/Electricgas/SolarEnergy/Florida%20Power%20and%20Light.pdf\">have said</a> they want to see Florida&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article111832342.html\">net metering law changed</a> to impose new fees on customer-owned solar users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than one legal expert told us it&rsquo;s ambiguous at best to say Amendment 1 offers protections. That&rsquo;s up to state and local officials, who already have laws and regulations in place. Seniors aren&rsquo;t specifically mentioned anywhere in the amendment&rsquo;s wording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only defined user of electricity in the amendment is &lsquo;consumer,&rsquo;&quot; Stetson University law professor Lance Long said. &quot;I think it is misleading to suggest that it does have a particular concern for seniors. It seems more in the genre of &lsquo;scare tactic&rsquo; rather than accurate information.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumers for Smart Solar said, &quot;Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amendment&rsquo;s wording doesn&rsquo;t mention seniors specifically, it only lets current consumer protection laws stand. That means the measure doesn&rsquo;t preclude any protections, but it also doesn&rsquo;t provide any. If there were no amendment at all, the effect on consumer laws and regulations would be the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This talking point may lead many voters, especially seniors, to think the amendment somehow offers new safeguards for solar customers, but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/024c4fbf-63d6-41c4-84da-916fa5ff938d\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/024c4fbf-63d6-41c4-84da-916fa5ff938d</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-02T14:42:39.916021", "ruling_date": "2016-11-03T12:01:16", "ruling_headline": "Amendment 1 promises to protect seniors, but measure offers no new regulations", "ruling_headline_slug": "amendment-1-backers-promise-protections-seniors-of", "ruling_link_text": "Amendment 1 neither adds or subtracts protections", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Consumers for Smart Solar, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jpXptHtplno\">Senior Protects I Yes On 1 For The Sun l The Florida Solar Amendment</a>,&quot;
