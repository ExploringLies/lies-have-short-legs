You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No. What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people, they put them in a bin, but in his hand, when he&rsquo;s picking them is, really, the worst of the worst. Congratulations, you&rsquo;re going to the United States. Okay. What a system &mdash; lottery system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump made similar comments on Dec. 20 at a Cabinet meeting: &quot;When we take people in a lottery, they&#39;re not putting their best people in the lottery. It&#39;s common sense. They&#39;re not saying, &#39;Oh, let&#39;s take our best people and let&#39;s put them into the lottery so that we can send them over to the United States.&#39; No. They put their worst people into the lottery. And that&#39;s what we get in many cases.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s recent comments parallel his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/06/donald-trump/trump-mexican-government-they-send-bad-ones-over/\">Pants on Fire</a> claim as presidential candidate that the Mexican government sends &quot;the bad ones&quot; over to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, Trump oversimplified and misconstrued the program. Countries don&#39;t send their people. Lottery applicants must meet minimum standards for education or work experience. The lottery is run by the United States, not foreign countries. Lottery winners are selected by a random, computerized process. Individuals must pass background vetting by the U.S. government before getting a visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House declined to comment on the record for this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump&rsquo;s criticism of the diversity visa lottery</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump favors a merit-based immigration system where people come in based on job skills, not just because of family connections or for diversity purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/926155393490878464\">said</a> the visa lottery &quot;presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security&quot; and has pointed as an example Sayfullo Saipov, from Uzbekistan, who entered the United States in 2010 through the lottery program. Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring a dozen other in an October vehicular attack in New York City. He&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42161549\">pleaded not guilty</a> to murder and terrorism charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States&rsquo; immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/diversity-visa\">50,000</a> per fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not foreign governments who run&nbsp;the lottery, it&#39;s administered by the U.S.&nbsp;State Department. Here&rsquo;s its current description of the program:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Applicants register online for the lottery in the fall;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Names of lottery winners are randomly selected by a computer;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Lottery winners are notified around May that they can apply for the diversity visa;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The visa application process and interviews begin Oct. 1. This step includes extensive vetting such as biographic and biometric&nbsp;screening against U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism databases;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Applicants who pass the vetting process are awarded the diversity visa, which is usually valid for <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-interview/diversity-visa-after-the-interview.html\">up to six months</a> from date of issuance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies,&quot; the State Department said in a statement to PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,&quot; the agency added.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The &lsquo;worst of the worst&rsquo;?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s comment that the worst are coming not only ignores vetting done by the State Department, but also lottery entry&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2019-Instructions-Translations/New_DV-2019_Restart_Plain_Language_Instructions_and_FAQs_.pdf\">requirements</a> of at least a high school education or its equivalent,&nbsp;or two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In countries where only a fraction of people complete secondary school, this basic criterion limits the pool of people eligible for the diversity lottery significantly,&quot; said Beth Elise Whitaker, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said countries are not &quot;giving us&quot; their best people. But that&#39;s a flawed statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries do not &quot;give&quot; immigrants, noted Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Individuals make decisions to apply for any visa, including but not limited to the diversity lottery visa. The decision is a difficult one, as is the process of receiving the visa,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;The application and vetting process are also complicated, suggesting that only highly capable and well-prepared individuals will succeed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cohen said Trump and his administration have promoted two conflicting goals: They have attacked family reunification immigration policies, but also the diversity lottery, &quot;which does not rely on family reunification and is far more skills-based than the name suggests.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The diversity visa program is a true lottery. There is no way a foreign government can game the lottery to offload the worst of their citizenry,&quot; Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School wrote in <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/trump-dishonest-diversity-visa-lottery-attack-article-1.3707384\">an op-ed</a> for the <em>New York Daily News</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said of the diversity visa lottery program, &quot;they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin,&quot; and &quot;the worst of the worst&quot; are selected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump based his criticism of the lottery program on the fact that the suspect in a New York City terror attack came through the program in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump&rsquo;s simplistic characterization gives a misleading impression of how the process actually works. First of all, countries don&#39;t&nbsp;&quot;give us&quot; immigrants. The lottery is administered by the United States, not foreign governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lottery entrants&nbsp;must meet educational and work experience requirements, and&nbsp;winners are chosen at random by a computer. Also, winning the lottery does not necessarily mean the person will come to the United States. They must be thoroughly vetted before being awarded a visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-20T13:38:06.970841", "ruling_date": "2017-12-20T15:36:41", "ruling_headline": "Pick them from a bin?
