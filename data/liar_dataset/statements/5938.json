But not on the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann, a businessman and former congressman, finished first in the first of three ballots at the party gathering. Each round of balloting narrowed the four-person field by one candidate. Businessman Eric Hovde dropped off first, then, in a surprise, former Gov. Tommy Thompson fell out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat left Neumann and Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald in the final runoff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut neither one passed the 60 percent threshold needed to win the party&rsquo;s nod and nobody emerged with the endorsement. Fitzgerald <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-others-failed-to-win-gop-senate-endorsement-4b5d4fj-151266195.html\">actually edged Neumann</a> with 51.5 percent. (We rated a related Fitzgerald claim of a &quot;win&quot; at the convention<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/17/jeff-fitzgerald/senate-candidate-jeff-fitzgerald-says-he-scored-wi/\"> Mostly True</a>)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about Neumann&rsquo;s claim of &quot;victory&quot; related to the &quot;2 to 1 vote to endorse&quot; him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe argues he won the most telling vote, when all four candidates were on the ballot for delegates, as they will be when facing voters in the September 2012 primary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that first round, Neumann had 42 percent, Fitzgerald 21 percent, Thompson 20 percent and Hovde 16 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s the 2-to-1 margin, Neumann&rsquo;s camp says. But that&rsquo;s only true if you compare his share to any one of his rivals. Neumann didn&rsquo;t win 65 or 70 percent of the vote, as his &quot;2-to-1&quot; claim suggests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann was the frontrunner on the first two ballots, but his support stalled in the upper 40s, while Fitzgerald&rsquo;s jumped to the slim majority in the final round.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann never got even a majority, much less 60 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome observers -- and Neumann&rsquo;s camp -- say Thompson and Hovde supporters voted tactically with Fitzgerald to deny Neumann the endorsement on later ballots.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s clear Neumann had something to crow about. He vanquished Thompson, the frontrunner in the polls, and led the pack on the earliest ballot. But that&rsquo;s like declaring victory at the first turn and not the finish line.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann was runner-up on the final vote. And it&rsquo;s highly misleading to say he was &quot;endorsed&quot; by delegates when no such endorsement was made.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Neumann&rsquo;s &quot;victory&quot; and &quot;endorsement&quot; claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-dueling-endorsement-claims-from-neumann-fitzgerald-4e5fahg-152024995.html\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s website</a>.)</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-17T17:06:20.044619", "ruling_date": "2012-05-17T20:14:28", "ruling_headline": "Senate candidate Mark Neumann says state Republicans voted to endorse him", "ruling_headline_slug": "senate-candidate-mark-neumann-says-state-republica", "ruling_link_text": "Now for the rest of the story...", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPhone interview with Chip Englander, Neumann campaign spokesperson, May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview with Jeff Fitzgerald, U.S. Senate candidate, May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann <a href=\"http://neumann2012.com/landing/convention/index.htm\">website appeal</a>, accessed May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Neumann.pdf\">email appeal</a>, May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel,<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-others-failed-to-win-gop-senate-endorsement-4b5d4fj-151266195.html\"> &quot;Senate hopefuls fail to win endorsement</a>,&quot; May 12, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Developer and homebuilder", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Mark", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 642, "last_name": "Neumann", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "mark-neumann", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Neumann_Mark.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/642/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://neumann2012.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Victory!
