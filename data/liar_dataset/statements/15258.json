Austin&rsquo;s and Sam Houston&rsquo;s statues were the only ones holding a rifle or a sword. I was reminded about the truth of all that&rsquo;s exceptional about America and Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That kind of historical trivia seems tailor-made for our Texas Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourists visiting Washington, D.C., learn that the Capitol <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/about-national-statuary-hall-collection\">houses 100 statues</a>, two donated by each state. According to the <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/defining-aoc\">Architect of the Capitol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/defining-aoc\">which is</a> the steward of the landmark buildings and grounds of Capitol Hill, such statues were confined to the building&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-buildings/national-statuary-hall\">National Statuary Hall</a> until Congress in 1933 reacted to overcrowding--at the time, 65 statues were wedged three-deep into the hall--by authorizing the statues to be spread throughout the building, which extends to the <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-buildings/us-capitol-visitor-center\">Capitol Visitor Center</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We scrolled online through the architect office&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/the-national-statuary-hall-collection\">posted photos</a> of the 100 statues. Could it be that only Austin and Houston were carved holding a gun or sword?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/stephen-austin\">Austin&rsquo;s statue</a> has a long gun front and center, it looked to us, while <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/sam-houston\">Houston&rsquo;s statue</a> just barely appeared to have a sword to its left rear side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But our click-through of photos of the Capitol statues showed that Houston wasn&rsquo;t the only one holding a sword. (A fair number of others, we saw, hold books.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>List of statues holding weapons</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we sought expert help, a curator from the Capitol architect&rsquo;s office, Jennifer Blancato, emailed us a list of Capitol statues holding weapons &mdash; with a notation that the Austin statue alone holds a firearm, which she listed as a rifle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blancato listed 12 Capitol statues--including the one of Houston--of men holding swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-digiacomantonio-4742a3109/\">William C. diGiacomantonio</a>, chief historian of the <a href=\"https://uschs.org/\">U.S. Capitol Historical Society,</a> which was <a href=\"https://uschs.org/about/mission-and-history/\">chartered</a> by Congress in the 1960s to educate the public on the Capitol&rsquo;s history and heritage, responded by email that the Capitol statue of Austin is the only one brandishing a musket or rifle while, he said, many Capitol statues hold swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blancato specified as the sword-holding statues: Houston; Gen. Joseph Wheeler of Alabama; Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida; Gen. James Shield of Illinois; John Stark of New Hampshire; Philip Kearney of New Jersey; John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania; Nathanael Greene of &nbsp;Rhode Island; John Sevier of Tennessee; Ethan Allen of Vermont; Robert E. Lee of Virginia; and Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. (Blancato otherwise said the statues of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii and Chief Washakie of Wyoming hold spears.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shared Blancato&rsquo;s break-out with Saenz who said in an emailed statement that he based his claim about the Texas statues on what he noticed while at the Capitol, perhaps &quot;because my focus is always primarily on Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saenz said the Capitol statues of Austin and Houston are &quot;the only ones holding a rifle or a sword.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This proud Texan&#39;s claim has an element of truth in that Austin&rsquo;s rifle-bearing statue alone holds a rifle.&nbsp; However, a dozen statues donated by states, including the one of Houston, hold swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement&nbsp;Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
