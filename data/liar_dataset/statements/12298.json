Some have cheered it, while more than&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/04/25/conservative-christian-group-boycotting-target-transgender-bathroom-policy/83491396/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>half a million people</u></a>&nbsp;had signed a boycott petition by American Family Association, a conservative Christian activist group, as of Tuesday. The group contends the policy encourages sexual predators and puts women and young girls in danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know the policy alone is controversial. But we wondered whether Target had taken its stance to an even more contentious level by installing urinals in a women&rsquo;s store restroom? That&rsquo;s the claim in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206100058808746&amp;set=a.10200809513828428.1073741825.1480872995&amp;type=3\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>popular Facebook post</u></a>&nbsp;by a user named Kathleen Crawford:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s true. ..I&#39;m in the women&#39;s bathroom at a Target north of LA...they actually took out a stall for women in order to accommodate the ones who have giblets...yes, these are urinals...for men...and so the war on women progresses. &hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The allegation inspired outrage on some conservative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rightwingnews.com/transgender/breaking-update-target-already-installing-urinals-womens-bathrooms-customer-claims-proof/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>blogs</u></a>, where it was taken as fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Facebook post includes a photo of two urinals wrapped in plastic inside a restroom with a red wall. It shows no evidence of where, exactly, the photo was taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Target, a corporate spokeswoman called the claim on Facebook &quot;inaccurate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have not made any changes to the restrooms,&quot; the spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said in an email. &quot;We have not added any urinals to any women&#39;s restrooms nor do we have any plans to do so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said the company never had past plans to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s going on with the photo?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say for certain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the person who posted it on Facebook, but we haven&rsquo;t heard back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The myth-busting website Snopes.com also&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/target-urinals/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>checked out</u></a>&nbsp;the Facebook post and found it False. It said the &quot;picture has&nbsp;nothing to do with Target&#39;s restroom policy. The image was not taken in a women&#39;s restroom at a Los Angeles Target store (rather a men&#39;s room that was undergoing repair or refurbishment).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com did not say how it found out where the photo came from. Snyder, the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Target spokeswoman, said she did not know its source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Target had made this change, we&rsquo;d expect more than just one photo to surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the woman on Facebook, and we&#39;ll add her response should we hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A popular Facebook post alleged last week that Target installed urinals in a women&rsquo;s restroom in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Target representatives told us the claim is &quot;inaccurate,&quot; and that the company has no plans to change its restrooms, and never did.
