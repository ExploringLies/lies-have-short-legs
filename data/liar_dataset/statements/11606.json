Chris Larson entering the 2016 race for Milwaukee County Executive, incumbent Chris Abele is trying to show residents he has been -- per his campaign tagline -- &quot;working for us for a change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an Oct. 29, 2015 interview on WisconsinEye, Abele was asked about the impact <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-to-vote-wednesday-on-additional-highway-borrowing-b99609695z1-340130011.html\">borrowing $200 million </a>for state highway funding would have in Milwaukee County. At the time, Scott Walker had just <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-asks-lawmakers-for-200-million-more-borrowing-for-roads-b99600018z1-334639771.html\">asked the Legislature to approve the borrowing</a> to keep road projects on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Decisions like that necessitate related decisions that lead to the county right now, for instance, &nbsp;getting less in transit funding still than we did five years ago,&quot; Abele said. &quot;But what I can tell you (public transit is) a priority to me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Abele shared this accomplishment: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This year there&rsquo;ll be a million route miles more than there were five years ago and we have never raised fares.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He echoed the claim in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOP8Xi6t5aE\">TV ad</a> released Nov. 17, 2015 by his re-election campaign, which declared: &quot;Chris Abele expanded the (bus) lines without increasing the fares.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Abele right that, thanks to his actions, fares have been kept flat and route miles increased since he took office?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background on fares and routes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abele was elected in April 2011 and is up for reelection in April 2016. It&rsquo;s the county executive&rsquo;s job to propose the transit budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 10 years before Abele took office, a period that includes Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s time in the job and the last of Tom Ament&rsquo;s tenure, fares increased and routes were cut nearly every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fares rose from $1.50 in 2001 to $2.25 by 2011. The total number of miles traveled by county buses fell from nearly 22 million in 2001 to about 17.1 million in 2011, a drop of 22 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, soon after Abele took office, the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/125060014.html\">state made a 10 percent cut</a> in transit aid. Abele obtained federal funds to keep fares flat and routes running</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where do things stand now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His team sent us budget documents from the Milwaukee County Transit System that showed fares at $2.25 in 2011 and the proposed fare for 2016 still at $2.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We double checked and fares did not go up and then back down in that time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, fares stayed the same for the last five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same documents backed up Abele&rsquo;s route miles claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, Milwaukee County buses are projected to travel 18,313,725 miles, that&rsquo;s over a million more than five years ago. The 2016 budget estimates route miles will increase again, to 18,416,499.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transit system calculates the route miles by multiplying the length of each route by the number of times the route runs in a day, multiplied by the days in the year, taking into account weekends and other days when busses run fewer trips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the additional miles were added in the last year:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Year</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Route miles</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mile increase from 2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>17,107,116</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>17,369,736</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>262,620</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>17,244,868</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>137,752</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>17,457,798</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>350,682</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>18,313,725</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1,206,609</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The large increase mostly attributed to the addition of three new routes that go from the central city to the suburbs.
