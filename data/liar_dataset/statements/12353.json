But after he became the GOP&rsquo;s last man standing and presumptive nominee, Trump said this week he&rsquo;s considering raising taxes on the rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn&rsquo;t take you at your words, as sort of that they&rsquo;re floors?&quot; <em>Meet the Press </em>host Chuck Todd <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-may-8-2016-n570111\">asked</a> Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is called life, Chuck. It&rsquo;s not my word, of course. I put in a proposal. You know what they are? They&#39;re really proposals. People can say it&rsquo;s a tax plan. It&rsquo;s really a tax proposal. Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress, you know as much as anybody, they start working with you and they start fighting,&quot; &nbsp;Trump responded. &quot;But I&rsquo;m not under the illusion that that it&rsquo;s going to pass. They&rsquo;re going to come to me. They&rsquo;re going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then explained why, despite that, he&rsquo;s still sticking to his guns and giving &quot;a massive&quot; tax cut to businesses: &quot;We&rsquo;re the highest taxed nation in the world. Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world. That&rsquo;s why companies are leaving.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a version of one of Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/06/donald-trump/trump-calls-us-highest-taxed-country-world/\">oft-repeated</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-most-highly-taxed-nation-worl/\">talking points</a>, and it&rsquo;s inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we looked at this claim in the past, we compared the United States to the 33 other industrialized nations in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV\">D</a><a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV\">ata from 2014</a>, the most recent year available, shows that the United States wasn&rsquo;t the most highly taxed by the typical metrics and actually places near the bottom or around the middle of the pack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump specified this time that he was talking about business taxes, but the essential data doesn&rsquo;t back him there, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump would have been more accurate if he had been more specific. The United States does have one of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/\">highest top marginal corporate tax rates</a> in the world. However, companies pay less in practice because they can take deductions and exclusions. When we look at the actual tax burden on U.S. companies, it&rsquo;s far from highest in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart breaking it down:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Tax revenue as percentage of GDP</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Corporate tax revenue as percentage of GDP</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Tax revenue per capita</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td rowspan=\"3\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>1.
