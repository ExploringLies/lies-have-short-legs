The average per person monthly benefit was around $126 last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart accurately quoted monthly <a href=\"https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/pd/34SNAPmonthly.pdf\">data</a> from the U.S. Department of Agriculture which showed that the number of participants in SNAP dropped from about 45.7 million in October 2017 to 41.7 million in November 2017 &mdash; a decrease of about four million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart explained that the decline was preceded by an increase following temporary Disaster-SNAP enrollment in Florida and Texas after the hurricanes. Food stamp clients jumped by about three million between September and October nationwide after the USDA approved Disaster-SNAP for <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/florida-disaster-nutrition-assistance\">Florida </a>and <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/texas-disaster-nutrition-assistance\">Texas</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said that DCF handed out these disaster benefits to 3.1 million people between late September and early December. In Texas, there were 1.6 million individuals served.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SNAP acts as a <a href=\"http://www.thisissnap.org/snap-is-a-first-responder/\">first responder</a> after natural disasters, providing assistance to households that may be vulnerable as a result of their place of employment temporarily closing, or facing expenses due to damage or relocation, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart&rsquo;s statement about the four-million drop in one month makes for a catchy headline, but if we put it in context and<a href=\"https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/pd/34SNAPmonthly.pdf\"> look at the data over a few months</a>,&nbsp;it showed that the November enrollment of about 41.7 million is in the same ballpark as many of the past several months, for example in May when there were 41.6 million SNAP clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts told PolitiFact that monthly enrollment can fluctuate due to factors such as disaster assistance, so it&rsquo;s more useful to look at longer stretches such as annual data to understand trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Food stamps on the decline since 2013</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart accurately noted that food stamp enrollment has been on the decline since fiscal year 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/pd/SNAPsummary.pdf\">Annual SNAP data </a>shows enrollment climbed from about 28.2 million in 2008 to 47.6 million in 2013 and has declined every year since that time.
