Rick Perry with taking undue credit for Texas job growth and ducking the limelight when the economy looks bleak.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEarlier this month, we rated <a href=\"http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/sep/23/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-has-created-more-850000-/\">True</a> Perry&#39;s boast in a TV ad that Texas has created more jobs than the other states combined.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Does he accept responsibility for one million Texans unemployed and a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states?&quot; White asked in a Sept. 27 e-mail.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhite&#39;s hammered the number of unemployed Texans before &mdash; in March, we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/mar/06/bill-white/white-says-almost-1-million-people-are-unemployed-/\">True</a> his claim that nearly 1 million Texans were unemployed, a state record. As of August, the number of unemployed crept up to 1,004,388, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. We wondered whether Texas has a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we consulted the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks unemployment data in each state, to see how Texas compared to the four states it borders: New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn August, Texas and New Mexico had an unemployment rate of 8.3 percent, followed by Louisiana (7.6 percent), Arkansas (7.5 percent), and Oklahoma (7 percent).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCheryl Abbot, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, confirmed that Texas had a higher unemployment rate than three of the four adjacent states, and noted that &quot;nearby states&quot; Colorado and Kansas also had a lower rate (8.2 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNext, we looked at Augusts past starting in 2001, Perry&#39;s first full year in the governor&#39;s office. We found that Oklahoma and Louisiana have had lower unemployment rates, and until this year, New Mexico had a lower unemployment rate than Texas. Arkansas had a higher unemployment rate than Texas in 2006 to 2008.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNationally, the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent in August. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia had higher unemployment rates than Texas.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUpshot: In August, Texas had a higher unemployment rate than Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, but not New Mexico.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate White&#39;s statement as Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-29T17:40:55.974595", "ruling_date": "2010-09-30T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Bill White says Texas has a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-white-says-texas-has-higher-unemployment-rate", "ruling_link_text": "Not New Mexico", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTexans for Bill White, Press release: White challenges Perry to answer to small businesses, the unemployed, Sept. 27, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/\" id=\"fk7f\" title=\"Local area unemployment statistics,\">Local area unemployment statistics,</a> accessed Sept. 28, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Katy Bacon, communications director, Bill White for Texas, Sept. 27, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Cheryl Abbot, economist, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, Sept. 29, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Former mayor of Houston", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 294, "last_name": "White", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "bill-white", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Whitemug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/294/", "total_count": 26, "true_count": 6, "website": "https://www.facebook.com/BillWhiteTexas"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tTexas has &quot;a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an e-mail", "statement_date": "2010-09-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
