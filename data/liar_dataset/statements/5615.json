Chris Christie&rsquo;s position is clear: he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this regard, Christie said during a Feb. 23 appearance on MSNBC&#39;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; program that he and President Barack Obama&nbsp;are like-minded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChristie, a Republican, and Obama, a Democrat, agreeing on an issue that has divided people across the nation?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot exactly, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The governor and the president agree on some issues related to same-sex marriage &ndash; but not all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s review what both leaders have said about&nbsp;gay marriage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChristie opposes same-sex marriage and on Feb. 17 conditionally vetoed a Legislature bill legalizing it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2008, prior to the presidential election, Obama said marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Since then, he has said is viewpoint is &quot;evolving,&quot; according to numerous published reports.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn vetoing the Legislature&rsquo;s bill, Christie suggested a referendum this November on gay marriage. Obama has opposed referenda on same-sex marriage, most recently legislation in North Carolina that would define marriage as between one man and one woman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what do the governor and president have in common? Both have said they support strengthening states&rsquo; civil union laws. But unlike Christie, Obama has not answered directly whether he supports same-sex marriage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhite House spokesman Brandon Lepow referred us to past remarks made by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney when we sought comment on Christie&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The President has long opposed &hellip; divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples,&quot; &nbsp;Carney said in January.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChristie has the same view, according to an e-mail from his spokesman Michael Drewniak.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The Governor has proposed a strengthening of civil unions to ensure that those rights are appropriately enforced and administered under the law. &nbsp;The Governor has never spoken to the legislature&rsquo;s qualifications to decide the issue one way or the other; he said what he would do with legislation if it was passed and did so (conditional veto), because it was against his beliefs. &nbsp;He said an issue of such magnitude and importance deserved to be put in the hands of the people, as a pathway for those who support same sex marriage to achieve it &ndash; if it was supported by a majority of voters. None of this is news, it&rsquo;s been said multiple times by the Governor.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut given their differing view on same-sex marriage referenda, Christie might have taken&nbsp;too far his claim of a similar view&nbsp;as Obama&nbsp;when program host Joe&nbsp;Scarborough asked, &quot;Is there any space on your position on gay marriage and President Barack Obama&#39;s?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not that I&#39;m aware of,&quot; Christie responded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others disagree with the governor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;President Obama has taken a strong position opposing state efforts to put the rights of minorities up for a popular vote -- including most recently in North Carolina -- and the President is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination against LGBT Americans under federal law, like the so-called &#39;Defense of Marriage&#39; Act,&quot; University of Pennsylvania law professor Tobias Barrington Wolff said in an e-mail. Wolff also was an adviser to Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign&nbsp;on issues affecting the gay community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNed Flaherty, a Boston-based project manager for Marriage Equality USA, criticized Christie for going against the Legislature&#39;s vote, vetoing&nbsp;the bill&nbsp;and suggesting a referendum be held.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;He&rsquo;s turning to people in the business of having a pulse on the public and saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rsquo;&quot; Flaherty said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring a recent television interview Christie said he and Obama shared the same views on gay marriage. That&rsquo;s true to a point &ndash; both leaders say they support civil unions and oppose discriminating against same-sex couples. But that&rsquo;s where the similarities end. Christie supports a public vote in New Jersey on allowing same-sex marriage; Obama opposes such referenda. Christie opposes same-sex marriage. The president won&rsquo;t answer the question directly.
