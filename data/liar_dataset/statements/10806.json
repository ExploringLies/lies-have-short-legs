Four seem relevant to this fact check. (The fifth deals with <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_Restriction_on_Gambling,_Question_2_%282014%29\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>requiring approval of voters before a gambling establishment can be relocated</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, Question 1 asked voters to <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_Question_1,_Casino_in_West_Warwick_%282006%29\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>authorize a resort casino in West Warwick</u></a>. That proposal was defeated. In 2012, two questions -- one <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_Casino_Gambling_Amendment,_Question_1_%282012%29\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>allowing casino games at Twin River</u></a>, the other <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_Newport_Grand_Casino_Amendment,_Question_2_%282012%29\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>at Newport Grand</u></a> -- were approved, although Newport voters rejected the Newport Grand proposal. In 2014, <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_Gaming_at_Newport_Grand,_Question_1_%282014%29\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a new proposal to authorize casino gambling at Newport Grand</u></a> was approved in a statewide vote, but lost again in Newport, where approval was also required for passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked the votes with the <a href=\"http://www.elections.state.ri.us/elections/preresults/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rhode Island Board of Elections</u></a>, we confirmed the tallies Doyle sent us and found a clear pattern.
