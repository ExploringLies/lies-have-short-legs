Andrew M. Cuomo has in seven years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In one day of fundraising I received more small donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years,&rsquo;&rsquo; Nixon said in an exclusive <a href=\"http://buffalonews.com/2018/03/22/cynthia-nixon-slams-cuomo-on-albanys-culture-of-corruption/\">interview</a> with The Buffalo News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo has a financial advantage over Nixon going into his third election for governor. He has a campaign war chest of more than $30 million. Nixon is starting from scratch, and she says she will not accept campaign money from corporate political action committees as Cuomo has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her campaign said she received 2,214 campaign contributions of under $200 in her first 24 hours as a candidate for governor. Cuomo, the campaign said, has received only 1,369 such donations since he took office in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon points to filings at the state Board of Elections to support her claim. We wanted to know if she was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Since 2011</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon&rsquo;s claim includes an important caveat: She counts only donations given to Cuomo after he first took office in 2011. She does not count donations Cuomo received when he first ran for governor in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you limit the analysis to her time frame, Nixon is right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo has received 1,369 donations under $200 since Jan. 1, 2011, according to a query of the Board of Elections database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That count includes only donations through &nbsp;the middle of January 2018, the latest campaign filing available. We don&rsquo;t know how many donations Cuomo has received since then. It&rsquo;s possible he has collected 845 small donations that would make Nixon&rsquo;s claim wrong. But filings show Cuomo has taken only 644 contributions of under $200 since his last inauguration in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Before 2011</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon would be wrong if she included donations from Cuomo&rsquo;s 2010 campaign for governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the start of his first campaign for governor in May 2010, Cuomo has collected 2,898&nbsp;campaign contributions of under $200, according to campaign finance filings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo received 1,529 such donations before 2011, filings show. That&rsquo;s fewer than Nixon received on her campaign&rsquo;s first day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In one day of fundraising I received more small-donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years,&quot; Nixon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s right. If you include the small-donor contributions he took during his first run for governor, Cuomo&rsquo;s small-donor contributions have (so far) outpaced Nixon&rsquo;s. But that&#39;s not what she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we rate her claim True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-22T16:00:38.377050", "ruling_date": "2018-03-22T17:11:29", "ruling_headline": "Cynthia Nixon says she had more small donors in one day than Cuomo in seven years", "ruling_headline_slug": "cynthia-nixon-claims-she-had-more-small-donors-one", "ruling_link_text": "But not since the 2010 campaign", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://buffalonews.com/2018/03/22/cynthia-nixon-slams-cuomo-on-albanys-culture-of-corruption/\">Cynthia Nixon slams Cuomo on Albany&#39;s culture of corruption</a>,&quot; The Buffalo News, March 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All contributions obtained using the New York State Board of Elections database</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Actress and Education Advocate", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Cynthia", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "New York", "id": 4246, "last_name": "Nixon", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "cynthia-nixon", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Cynthia_Nixon_thumbnail.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4246/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://cynthiafornewyork.com"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In one day of fundraising I received more small donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Buffalo News article", "statement_date": "2018-03-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Andrew", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "New York", "id": 2880, "last_name": "Cuomo", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "andrew-cuomo", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Cuomo_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2880/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.governor.ny.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": "Fact-check | Comparing small donations: Cynthia Nixon vs. Andrew Cuomo"}
