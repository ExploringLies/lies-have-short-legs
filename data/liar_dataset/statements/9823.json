Kay Hagan, D-N.C., say&nbsp;giving tax breaks to yacht and jet owners is one way that her opponent has shown he is out-of-touch with the state&rsquo;s average families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the North Carolina race for U.S. Senate, much of the debate has focused on Republican candidate Thom Tillis&rsquo; actions as a state leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, the North Carolina government received national attention for a wave of conservative legislation. The Republican-dominated General Assembly -- with Tillis as speaker of the House -- passed laws increasing voter ID requirements, lowering business regulations, upping restrictions on abortion providers, tightening education spending, trimming unemployment benefits and changing the tax code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another fact-check, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/25/patriot-majority-usa/liberal-pac-says-senate-candidate-thom-tillis-tax-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>we found</u></a> that the controversial tax code changes reduced taxes for everyone -- but much more for wealthier people than lower-income people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters of Hagan, the incumbent, keep harping on this point about the tax code in particular: Tillis supports tax breaks for yacht and jet owners. You can hear that claim <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IknYJau234Y\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>here</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr_9kx2-qLs\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>here </u></a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg1BgFT-3VM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>here</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, we heard it in an ad from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOphgAp6l8w\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate Majority PAC</u></a>, a liberal political action committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When it comes to education, Thom Tillis is gambling with our future,&quot; the ad&rsquo;s narration says. &quot;As speaker, he cut nearly <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/19/emilys-list/did-republican-senate-candidate-thom-tillis-cut-50/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$500 million</u></a> from education, eliminating 9,000 teaching positions and overcrowding classrooms. Now he&rsquo;s promising more lottery money for education? We&rsquo;ve heard that broken promise before. Meanwhile, Tillis gives tax breaks for yacht and private jet owners.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the other ads said Tillis &quot;protected&quot; tax breaks for yacht and jet owners, but others -- including this one -- say he gave&nbsp;them the tax breaks. We decided to look into the claim a little more closely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>N.C. tax code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, under Tillis&rsquo; leadership, North Carolina lawmakers passed legislation to overhaul the tax code -- which hadn&rsquo;t had comprehensive reform since the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary change was switching the income tax from a progressive rate to a flat rate. The law also eliminated tax holidays, sales tax exemptions and the State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what did the law do for yacht and jet owners? Well, nothing, really. It preserved the tax breaks that were already in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1991, boats and aircraft -- a broader category than just yachts and jets -- have had a sales tax rate of 3 percent, with a $1,500 cap. This means that anyone who buys a boat or plane worth $50,000 or more pays exactly $1,500 in taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate had been 2 percent from 1969 to 1991, and the cap was $300 until 1989, <a href=\"http://www.ncleg.net/documentsites/committees/jhsfctr/Meeting%20Documents/11-3-2009%20Meeting/Overview%20of%20NC%20Sales%20Tax.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to a document</u></a> prepared by the North Carolina General Assembly research division.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Tillis and other Republican state lawmakers did not create tax breaks for plane and boat owners, they left the prior tax breaks in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/07/18/3039363_nc-tax-bill-closes-some-loopholes.html?rh=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><em><u>News and Observer</u></em><u> </u></a>in Raleigh, the law only cut 48 of the more than 300 tax breaks included in the tax code. Additionally, the legislature did not include the boat and airplane tax&nbsp;breaks in a&nbsp;bundle of loopholes that received&nbsp;additional scrutiny in a study committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Tillis, though he was speaker at the time and supported the bill, was not an author or primary sponsor of the tax code legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cap on boat and aircraft sales taxes amounts to $10 million in lost annual revenue, according to the <a href=\"http://ncjustice.org/sites/default/files/TAX%20REFORM%20-%20The%20Future%20is%20Now2.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>N.C.
