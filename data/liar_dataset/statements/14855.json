Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama, a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">According to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5,327. If the disparity in numbers isn&rsquo;t enough to give you reason to smell something fishy, the population of the town should. There are 2,256 residents there and only 1,867 registered voters. In other words, more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quick facts:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name of the purported board is a variation of the &quot;State Election Integrity Board&quot; named in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/13/nofakenews-online/no-undocumented-immigrants-were-not-caught-voting-/?src=ilaw\">other fake news items</a>, which a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State previously told PolitiFact does no exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bordalama?
