Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to see if corporate profits are indeed up in the past two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatistics on corporate profits are calculated by the U.S. Commerce Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Economic Analysis. They are determined both on an annual and a quarterly basis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2010/pdf/gdp3q10_2nd.pdf\">According to BEA</a>, corporate profits -- officially known as &quot;corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments&quot; -- were as follows:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2007</strong>: $1.511 trillion<br />\r\n\t<strong>2008</strong>: $1.263 trillion<br />\r\n\t<strong>2009</strong>: $1.258 trillion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately, since we&rsquo;re only 25 days into 2011, BEA has yet not calculated the figure for 2010, so we&rsquo;re left to use annualized estimates based on the quarterly figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent quarterly estimate, based on the third quarter of 2010, produced annualized corporate profits of $1.659 trillion. Even the lowest annualized estimate for corporate profits, based on the first quarter of 2010, pegged them at $1.567 trillion -- still well above either of the full-year amounts for 2008 and 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the only thing that could make Obama&rsquo;s statement incorrect would be a woeful under performance in the fourth quarter of 2010, but that seems unlikely based on current expert estimates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset Management in Sydney, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-01-19/asian-stocks-rise-on-u-s-profit-reports-china-growth-optimism.html\">told Bloomberg Businessweek in mid-January</a> that &quot;the earnings recovery in the U.S. has been exceptional post-crisis. It seems the recovery in the U.S. economy is starting to broaden, which will support revenue and earnings growth. China&rsquo;s economy is robust, but it&rsquo;ll take at least six months of strong data to silence those calling a policy-induced hard landing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, if the third-quarter rate holds, corporate profits for 2010 would set a record. <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=43&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Year&amp;FirstYear=2000&amp;LastYear=2009&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no\">The current record was set in 2006 </a>-- the last full year before the onset of the recent recession. That year, corporate profits hit $1.608 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course, corporate profits are just one component of the economy -- and just one part of Americans&rsquo; perceptions of how well the nation is doing economically. Unemployment is still stubbornly high, and indeed, some commentators have been critical of companies&rsquo; hesitancy to invest on new hires amid such high profits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Obama was correct in his description of the trend in corporate profits. One could say that he&rsquo;s being presumptuous by assuming what the full 2010 figure will be before it&rsquo;s officially announced, but we think that the current trendlines for corporate profits, combined with recent fourth-quarter reports, put the level so far above the 2009 level that it&rsquo;s highly unlikely to drop once the full-year numbers have been released. So we rate Obama&rsquo;s statement True.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-25T21:07:27.842954", "ruling_date": "2011-01-25T21:06:04", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama in State of the Union says corporate profits are up over the past two years", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-state-union-says-corporate-profits-ar", "ruling_link_text": "In fact, profits are on pace to set an all-time record", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBureau of Economic Analysis, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2010/pdf/gdp3q10_2nd.pdf\">Table </a><a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2010/pdf/gdp3q10_2nd.pdf\">9.</a>Relation of Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Product, and National Income,&quot; Nov. 23, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Economic Analysis, &quot;National Income and Product Accounts <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=43&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Year&amp;FirstYear=2000&amp;LastYear=2009&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no\">Table 1.7.5.</a>: Relation of Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Product, Net National Product, National Income, and Personal Income,&quot; accessed Jan. 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBloomberg Businessweek, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-01-19/asian-stocks-rise-on-u-s-profit-reports-china-growth-optimism.html\">Asian Stocks Rise on U.S. Profit Reports, China Growth Optimism,</a>&quot; Jan. 19, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known ... corporate profits are up.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "statement_context": "the State of the Union address", "statement_date": "2011-01-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 101, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/101/", "subject": "Corporations", "subject_slug": "corporations", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
