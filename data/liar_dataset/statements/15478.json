I have to tell you, the Coast Guard saved 16,000 people. &nbsp;What do you think of that, Ben? Sixteen-thousand people. (Applause.)

I don&rsquo;t think the Coast Guard gets enough credit. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;ve said it, and I even say it to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. I said, I think this year the Coast Guard, maybe in terms of increased branding &mdash; the brand of the Coast Guard has been something incredible what&rsquo;s happened. Saved 16,000 people, many of them in Texas, for whatever reason that is. People went out in their boats to watch the hurricane. That didn&rsquo;t work out too well. &nbsp;That didn&rsquo;t work out too well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Houston Chronicle</em> said in a <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Is-Texas-ready-for-another-Harvey-12972164.php\">news story</a> posted later the same day that law enforcement &quot;first responders&quot; were baffled by Trump&rsquo;s boating claim which, the story said, nobody could explain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story quoted Harris County&rsquo;s sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, crediting civilians with making an &quot;extraordinary effort&quot; with their own boats to rescue neighbors, relatives and pets as Hurricane Harvey flooded the Texas coast with 52 inches of rain. &quot;I didn&#39;t see anyone taking the approach that would reflect his comments,&quot; Gonzalez said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, Gov. Greg Abbott said he had &quot;no information one way or another about&quot; what Trump described and Coast Guard Petty Officer Edward Wargo told the <em>Chronicle</em>: &quot;I don&rsquo;t know how we would go about confirming that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No confirmations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our search of the Nexis news database turned up a September 2017&nbsp;<em>Tampa Bay Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/weather/hurricanes/cruise-ship-rescues-florida-shrimp-boat-captain-from-hurricane-irma-as/2337498\">news story</a> on a man rescued from a Florida shrimping boat overtaken by&nbsp;Hurricane Irma yet no news accounts on people taking boats out to watch hurricanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We later connected with Chad Saylor, a spokesman for the Coast Guard at its Washington, D.C., headquarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saylor had&nbsp;no comment on the president&rsquo;s boating claim, referring us to the White House, which offered no on-the-record response to our inquiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saylor otherwise advised by email that the Coast Guard, teaming with multiple law agencies, rescued nearly 12,000 people during the nation&rsquo;s 2017 hurricanes, mostly from rooftops in urban areas, Saylor said by phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard&rsquo;s commandant, <a href=\"https://www.uscg.mil/Portals/0/seniorleadership/SOTCG/2018_State_of_the_Coast_Guard_Address_linked.pdf\">said</a> in a March 2018 speech that the agency responded to the year&rsquo;s hurricanes by dispatching nearly 3,000 first responders and more than 200 helicopters, cutters, small boats and fixed-wing aircraft. Of its rescues, Zukunft said: &quot;Most of those men, women, and children were rescued from the roofs and flooded streets of Houston, Beaumont, and Port Arthur, Texas&hellip; areas not generally accustomed to seeing Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead, dangling rescue swimmers into urban settings, as water engulfed their homes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Sept. 7, 2017, Coast Guard <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCG/bulletins/1b5ace3\">news release</a> says that in response to Hurricane Harvey, Coast Guard members&nbsp;helped rescue 11,022 people and 1,384 pets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christopher Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also had no comment on Trump&rsquo;s claim. Vaccaro&nbsp;suggested by email that we contact the Coast Guard and local law enforcement agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also reached Bill Read, a resident of League City, outside Houston, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/qa/201205_bill_read.php\">former director of the Miami-based National Hurricane Center</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Read commented that he was unaware of anyone ever going out on a boat to watch a hurricane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Read said. &quot;It&rsquo;s dangerous.&quot; Read said it&rsquo;d be &quot;insane&quot; to take a boat into the ocean to watch a hurricane because of tremendous storm-related currents and waves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inland in 2017, Read said, &quot;the people I know who were out on boats were trying to rescue people&quot; from Harvey-caused flooding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, saluting Coast Guard rescues accomplished when hurricanes battered the U.S., also said: &quot;People went out in their boats to watch&quot; Hurricane Harvey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House didn&rsquo;t provide nor did we find confirmation of people venturing out on boats to watch the hurricane.&nbsp;The boats we saw people using in Houston and elsewhere were to evacuate flooded homes and neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>PANTS ON FIRE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
