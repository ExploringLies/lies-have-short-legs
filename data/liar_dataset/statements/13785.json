although in many cases, they would be people transferred from other departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It really kind of takes the whole heart of state government -- especially as money flows in and out of agencies, and puts it into the Department of Administration,&quot; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving aside Vinehout&rsquo;s view of the impact of the move, let&rsquo;s check whether Walker is proposing to add 485 positions &quot;in the category of supervisor and management&quot; to his Department of Administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major functions of the <a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Home\">Department of Administration</a> include helping the governor develop and implement the state budget and supporting other state agencies with centralized purchasing and financial management. <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2015_2016/600_executive_branch.pdf\">The department also</a> coordinates telecommunications, energy, and land use planning and community development, and it regulates racing, charitable gaming and Indian gaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://doa.wi.gov/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/2017-19%20Executive%20Budget/Budget%20Book%20Combined%20v3%20Provisional.pdf\">Walker&rsquo;s budget</a>, which must be approved by the Legislature, would increase the department&rsquo;s positions in both years of the budget. The new total for the department would be 1,149 positions -- an increase of 485. And those positions are listed under the heading of &quot;supervision and management.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, gave us some context about the 485:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The majority of positions are held by existing employees who work for other agencies; these are not new state government positions.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The majority would continue to physically work in those agencies, such as the Department of Natural Resources, but would become employees of the Department of Administration.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Despite the designation in the budget document as &quot;supervision and management,&quot; the vast majority would not be supervisors or managers -- rather they are involved in the supervision and management of human resource activities such as employee recruitment and assistance, training, and payroll and benefits.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://doa.wi.gov/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/2017-19%20Executive%20Budget/17-19%20BIB%20FINAL%20revised%2002082017.pdf\">Walker says</a> the primary aim is to &quot;assign various administrative functions to a single entity, allowing individual agencies to focus on their core business missions and avoid redundant efforts on services that can be offered most effectively from a central entity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that if the Legislature goes along with Walker&rsquo;s plan, those employees would be more directly under his control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sounding alarms about Walker&rsquo;s budget, Vinehout says the governor is proposing to add 485 positions &quot;in the category of supervisor and management&quot; to his Department of Administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vinehout is correct on the number and, technically, they are &quot;in the category&quot; of supervisor and management. But while they are involved in the supervision and management of human resource activities, the vast majority are not actually in supervisory or management positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" style=\"width: 100%;
