At one point in a July 11, 2015, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=496&amp;v=ls3m7NUOqxs\">speech in Phoenix</a>, he took aim at the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama&rsquo;s signature health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He singled out the <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov\">healthcare.gov</a> website, which was unveiled in the fall of 2013 with a panoply of bugs and glitches, calling it &quot;the $5 billion website for Obamacare, which never worked. Still doesn&#39;t work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a year and a half after the website&rsquo;s troubled launch, and it&rsquo;s been awhile since <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/mar/14/healthcaregov-working-great-now/\">we&rsquo;ve taken a look at how the website is doing</a> and what it has cost to build. So we decided to see if Trump has any basis either for saying that the healthcare.gov website cost $5 billion or that it &quot;still doesn&rsquo;t work.&quot; (Trump&rsquo;s camp didn&rsquo;t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take each of these claims in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did the website cost $5 billion?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of the website has been a bone of contention ever since its launch, partly because federal contracting is complex, involving some <a href=\"http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-14-00231.pdf\">60 major contracts</a>. Our friends at the <em>Washington Post </em>Fact Checker grappled with this question over the course of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/24/how-much-did-healthcare-gov-cost/\">two</a> separate <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/19/how-much-did-healthcare-gov-cost-part-2/\">reports</a> that included several interim updates as new data surfaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officially, the Department of Health and Human Services says the website cost $834 million. That&rsquo;s the number offered by then-HHS Secretary-designate Sylvia Mathews Burwell at a Senate hearing on May 8, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of Feb. 28, 2014, <a href=\"http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/050814_HELP_Burwell_QFRs-Alexander-FINAL.pdf\">Burwell told lawmakers</a>, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- the part of HHS responsible for the website -- &quot;has obligated a total of approximately $834 million on marketplace-related (information technology) contracts and interagency agreements.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not everyone has taken that figure at face value. Bloomberg Government <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-24/obamacare-website-costs-exceed-2-billion-study-finds\">undertook a study</a> that used a more generous definition of the relevant federal spending. In the study, released in September 2014, researchers included several additional costs beyond the government&rsquo;s official estimate -- $387 million in spending by the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies beyond HHS, as well as a $300 million contract to process paper applications, and additional spending by HHS after the cutoff for Burwell&rsquo;s estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using this broader net, Bloomberg Government came up with a figure of $2.1 billion. That&rsquo;s bigger than the official estimate, but it&rsquo;s still not as large as what Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the Bloomberg Government study&rsquo;s author, Peter Gosselin, whether he thought the number could have more than doubled to $5 billion since the study was released 10 months ago. He was skeptical, saying that even if you add on a five-year follow-up contract with the firm Accenture, it should &quot;only get you about halfway to $5 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump&rsquo;s figure seems exaggerated. However, we have a hunch about where it came from, and while it&rsquo;s wrong, it&rsquo;s easy to see how someone could have made the mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a provision of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has spent nearly $5 billion in a series of grants to states to establish health care exchanges, according to tabulations made by both the <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43066.pdf\">Congressional Research Service</a> and the <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/total-exchange-grants/\">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>. This $5 billion statistic was <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/13/Over-5-Billion-and-Counting-Obamacare-Websites\">widely reported</a> and pops up easily during Google searches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would seem to suggest that the government had spent $5 billion on healthcare.gov. But that&rsquo;s not quite correct, experts told PolitiFact. Rather, these grants were designed to boost state efforts under the law -- not the federal site -- and paid for a <a href=\"https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7908-02.pdf\">wide variety of things</a> other than websites, including helping insurers prepare to join the exchanges, offering assistance through telephone hotlines, establishing marketing and outreach efforts for potential beneficiaries, and hiring &quot;navigators&quot; who help beneficiaries obtain care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Gosselin and Jennifer Tolbert, the director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation, agreed that it would be incorrect to simply assume that the $5 billion in health insurance exchange grants is tantamount to spending on the website in the way Trump expressed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a different pot of money,&quot; Tolbert said. &quot;It&rsquo;s entirely separate from the money used to build the healthcare.gov website.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it true that healthcare.gov &#39;still doesn&rsquo;t work&#39;?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This part of Trump&rsquo;s claim is easier to debunk. The proof is in the millions of Americans who have used the healthcare.gov website to obtain insurance coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2015/MarketPlaceEnrollment/Mar2015/ib_2015mar_enrollment.pdf\">most recent data</a> released by HHS, covering the open-enrollment period between November 2014 to February 2015, a total of 11.7 million Americans selected or were automatically enrolled in an insurance plan for 2015 using the online marketplaces. Of that, 8.84 million signed up through the federal marketplace -- healthcare.gov -- with the remainder signing up through state-run websites. (These figures are not limited to those who have already made their first premium payment.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, clearly, the site is working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say the system is working 100 percent perfectly. &quot;There are some remaining issues, especially for certain populations, such as immigrants and people for whom it&#39;s difficult to verify their identity or income using electronic data,&quot; Tolbert said. &quot;This can include people who have not been in the country very long or who haven&rsquo;t yet worked long enough to establish a work and income history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the site appears to be functioning well in most cases. &quot;Since the troublesome launch of healthcare.gov, (the government) has taken various actions to address the problems that impeded the initial use of the website and its supporting systems,&quot; the Government Accountability Office, Congress&rsquo; investigative arm, concluded in a <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/668834.pdf\">March 2015 report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Operationally, the website works for the most part,&quot; said Tolbert of Kaiser. &quot;It&rsquo;s in much better shape than it was during the first few months of open enrollment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said &quot;the $5 billion website for Obamacare &hellip; never worked. Still doesn&#39;t work.&quot; But experts say that, using the most reasonable definitions, Trump overstates the amount of money spent to create and fix healthcare.gov, and his claim that the website isn&rsquo;t working -- and never did -- is debunked by the fact that millions of Americans have signed up for insurance through the site, even if some more limited glitches remain. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-14T12:02:59.662514", "ruling_date": "2015-07-14T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says the '$5 billion website for Obamacare \u2026 never worked.
