The evidence we found is something of a mixed bag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, they pointed us to a periodic <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/182795/russia-receives-lowest-approval-world-highest.aspx?utm_source=leadership%20U.S.&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=tiles\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>survey by Gallup</u></a>. The most recent Gallup poll, covering 2014 and released April 21, 2015, is based on face-to-face and telephone interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, age 15 and older, in each of more than 130 countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gallup poll asks respondents whether they approve of the leadership of the United States, Germany, the European Union, China and Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, the United States finished first among this group. The median approval rating for the United States was 45 percent. That contrasts with 2008, President George W. Bush&rsquo;s last year in office, when the U.S. scored 34 percent, trailing Germany, the European&nbsp;Union&nbsp;and China. That year, Russia was a bit lower at 30 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Do you approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leadership of ______?\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1Mw400UF5mMzno6N0IJw3yYsB0_g3F5D6h_f2EgMEN4xCum-m-ei5t5KrZ2obObL-613czqefKzKJgJxhikQSjPWSRAK74JMF6qw_r8NZVx9SUbQLw1CM-scT4vRcWNoX7_gaTg\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:403px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:494px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House added that the Pew Research Center backs up the notion that the country&rsquo;s image has improved under Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;America&rsquo;s image began to rally in some nations and to soar by the end of the decade following the election of Barack Obama, at least in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-1-the-american-brand/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pew wrote in 2014</u></a>. &quot;After slipping a bit again in the first years of this decade, brand U.S. has stabilized and even recovered in a few nations in 2014.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a different&nbsp;survey we found showed that the United States trailed other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year, the BBC publishes a survey that asks people for their opinions about a variety of countries&rsquo; &quot;influence on the world.&quot; The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/27685494\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most recent survey</u></a> was conducted between December 2013 and April 2014.
