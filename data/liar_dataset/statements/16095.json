In May, the account shared an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThePlanetToday/photos/a.2002486229989406/2058123014425727/?type=3&amp;theater\">image of what appears to be a great white</a> breaching, soaring above the surf. &quot;National Geographic&rsquo;s photo of the year,&quot; the caption says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo was posted by a Facebook account called &quot;The Planet Today&quot; and it&rsquo;s been shared more than 300,000 times. The account did not immediately respond to a message seeking the source of the photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Geographic also did not immediately respond to an email asking about the Facebook post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, searching for the image on Google reveals a number of posts that pre-date 2018. In February 2017, for example, a Twitter user tapped the image for some early-morning inspiration. &quot;Do sharks complain about it being Monday?&quot; he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coachdmarsh/status/833632117586329602?lang=en\">tweeted</a>. &quot;No, they are up early, biting stuff, chasing food, being scary, reminding everyone they&rsquo;re a shark.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shark has shown up on <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/Barbzzzzzz/sharks/?lp=true\">Pinterest</a> and <a href=\"https://steemkr.com/steemiteducation/@frieda/the-great-white-shark\">blogs</a>. But we couldn&rsquo;t find any credible websites connecting it to National Geographic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Geographic does has an annual <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/contests/photographer-of-the-year-2018/\">Travel Photographer of the Year</a> competition. The grand prize this year <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/contests/photographer-of-the-year-2018/gallery/winners-all/1/\">was awarded to Reiko Takahashi</a>, who photographed a humpback whale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shark wasn&rsquo;t the photo of the year in 2016, either, when this same shark pic was making the rounds on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2016, National Geographic <a href=\"https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/shark-pictures-not-fake-brain-skerry/\">posted a blog</a> refuting a claim that the photo was its photo of the year&mdash;an award the magazine doesn&rsquo;t have. But <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/contributors/s/daniel-stone/\">editor Daniel Stone</a> took the opportunity to blast fake news as a &quot;threat to those of us in the business of telling the truth.&quot; He also shared 14 real shark photos.
