Linda D. Finn, D-Middletown, who has argued for more gun restrictions, and state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale, R-Foster, who has argued that laws already in place can address concerns if only they were properly enforced.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt one point, Tim White, the show&rsquo;s host, brought up one of the proposed bills, which would make it illegal for anyone under 18 to possess a gun, aside from exceptions such as hunting, rifle ranges and competitive target shooting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChippendale called the proposal &quot;well intended, but poorly drafted,&quot; saying it would contradict another law on the books that provides for licensed hunting by young people.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinn countered that the proposal is intended for police on the streets of Providence and other cities when they come upon a minor with a firearm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Because right now, if they [the police] come across a [young] person with a gun, they really don&#39;t legally have the right to take it away from them,&quot; Finn said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered whether Finn&rsquo;s statement was accurate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText13/HouseText13/H5576.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">The legislation in question </a>is actually an amendment of Rhode Island statute <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-47/11-47-33.HTM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">11-47-33</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe statute currently says &quot;possession and use&quot; of certain firearms by someone under age 18 is prohibited in Rhode Island unless he or she has had a permit issued -- under <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-47/11-47-34.HTM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">11-47-34</a> -- by the Rhode Island State Police or by a local police chief. And that permit can only be issued, the law states, &quot;upon satisfactory proof of being engaged in a course of training in the use of firearms at a regular and recognized camp or rifle range, and provided that the person has the written consent of a guardian.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe bill in the legislature calls for dropping the words &quot;and use&quot; from 11-47-33.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe reason? According to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin&rsquo;s office, the bill was filed because &quot;currently, for a minor to be guilty of possession of a firearm they must possess and use the firearm.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSteven M. Pare, the Providence public safety commissioner, said police chiefs support the revision of statute 11-47-33 that would remove the words &quot;and use,&quot; making it illegal in most cases for juveniles simply to possess a firearm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDespite Finn&rsquo;s assertion the the police can&rsquo;t take guns away from minors, Pare, said that police can and do charge young people with possession of handguns, using <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-47/11-47-8.HTM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">another statute, 11-47-8,</a> which prohibits minors from obtaining a carry/conceal permit.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there&rsquo;s another issue in current law, that gives some credence to Finn&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Attorney General&rsquo;s office says that due to what it calls a loophole, the law does not cover shotguns, rifles and other long guns, Kempe said, which could include such weapons as an AK-47, AR-15 and an M-16 -- so long as those are not fully automatic. (Possession of automatic weapons is illegal in all cases.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, if the police see a juvenile carrying such a weapon, they can&rsquo;t confiscate it under current law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKempe said the &quot;long guns&quot; at issue are rarely something the police encounter on the streets involving minors; pistols and revolvers, which are already covered under current law and for which the police can arrest and seize the guns, are much more common, she said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tState Rep. Linda D. Finn said that if the police come across a young person with a gun, &quot;they really don&#39;t legally have the right to take it away from them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder current law, police can seize handguns from juveniles, the weapons most commonly used in street crime. But they can&rsquo;t seize rifles and other so-called long guns.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNew legislation could change that.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut for now, we rate Finn&rsquo;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
