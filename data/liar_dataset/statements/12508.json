Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints. The ad shows a photo of the reporter, whose right hand is sharply angled at the wrist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad cuts to a video clip of Trump at the rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You gotta see this guy,&quot; says Trump, wildly flailing his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouts in a weird, agitated voice: &quot;Ahh, I don&rsquo;t know what I said! Ahh, I don&rsquo;t remember!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I saw Donald Trump mock somebody with a disability, it showed me his soul, it showed me his heart. And I didn&rsquo;t like what I saw,&quot; the father, Chris Glaros, adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TV ad (which you can watch in full at the bottom of this fact-check)&nbsp;is airing in seven crucial swing states -- Colorado, Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire and Iowa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact is fact-checking the obvious question: Did Trump mock the man&rsquo;s disability?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, we want to separate Trump&rsquo;s parody of the reporter from the reality. Kovaleski is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who speaks with a normal voice and doesn&#39;t wave his arms around. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydGOPzW227E\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Watch a video of Kovaleski</u></a> talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump tweeted about the ad on Sunday: &quot;Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!&quot; The Trump campaign did not respond to PolitiFact&rsquo;s request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact also contacted Kovaleski, who declined comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why Trump singled out this reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of the November rally, Trump was taking heat for his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/nyregion/a-definitive-debunking-of-donald-trumps-9-11-claims.html?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F06%2F07%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fsuper-pac-highlights-donald-trumps-mockery-of-disabled-journalist.html&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>widely debunked</u></a> claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as &nbsp;&quot;thousands and thousands of people were cheering&quot; the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To defend this account, Trump seized on a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/09/18/northern-new-jersey-draws-probers-eyes/40f82ea4-e015-4d6e-a87e-93aa433fafdc/?tid=a_inl\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sept. 18, 2001</u></a>, story by Kovaleski -- who then worked for the <em>Washington Post</em> -- and another reporter. Near the bottom of the story, they wrote that &quot;law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.&quot; But the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reporters couldn&rsquo;t verify</u></a> the celebrations actually occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,&quot; Kovaleski later told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><em><u>Washington Post</u></em><u> Fact Checker</u></a>. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that &quot;a number of people&quot; -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This why Trump, believing that Kovaleski was backing off the 2001 story, wailed in his impersonation, &quot;Ahh, I don&rsquo;t remember!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s behavior sparked public outrage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> rebuked Trump in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/25/trump-blasted-by-new-york-times-after-mocking-reporter-with-disability/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>statement</u></a>: &quot;We think it&#39;s outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colleagues and friends defended Kovaleski.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;@sergenyt is one of the best reporters &mdash; and best people &mdash; I know. This is despicable,&quot; ESPN reporter and author Don Van Natta Jr. wrote on Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People who share Kovaleski&rsquo;s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag &quot;AMCStrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump denied making fun off the reporter&rsquo;s disability. &quot;I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago,&quot; he said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/669980142475845632\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>statement at the time</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t buy that. (Trump) clearly was mocking his disability,&quot; said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, when we asked her about it. &quot;That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn&#39;t use that voice or wave his arms like that.&quot; Reiskin stressed that she was just giving her view of how Trump acted, because her nonprofit group can&#39;t endorse or oppose any candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reiskin said Trump&rsquo;s rally display &quot;portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can&#39;t control your speech or part of your body that you&#39;re not competent, which is very destructive&quot; to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, recently withdrew his support for Trump after Trump said an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican descent was incapable of fairly presiding over a class-action lawsuit against Trump and his defunct Trump University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:5pt\">But Kirk also <a href=\"https://kirkforsenate.com/news/senator-kirk-statement-presidential-race/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_campaign=20160607_mk-lb-og-soc_twitter&amp;utm_content=mk\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>referred to</u></a> Trump&rsquo;s comments.<strong> </strong>Kirk suffered a serious stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair after years of rehabilitation. &quot;Donald Trump&rsquo;s latest statements, in context with past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that I cannot and will not support my party&rsquo;s nominee for president,&quot; Kirk said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the rally backlash, Trump insisted in a statement he couldn&rsquo;t have known the man was disabled because &quot;I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. &hellip; Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the <em>New York Daily News</em> in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the <em>Washington Post </em>he was sure the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/25/trump-blasted-by-new-york-times-after-mocking-reporter-with-disability/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>businessman remembered him -- and his condition</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/us/politics/donald-trump-says-his-mocking-of-new-york-times-reporter-was-misread.html?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kovaleski told the </u><em><u>New York Times</u></em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Kovelski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the &quot;inaugural voyage&quot; of the Trump Shuttle airline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Flying out of La Guardia, we spent a big chunk of the day flying up and down the east coast with Trump chatting with me and the others on the plane,&quot; Kovaleski told the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/reporter-donald-trump-mocked-spent-day-mogul-1989-article-1.2448381?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Daily News</u></a>. He added that a furious Trump called the next day and screamed at him&quot; because Kovaleski had reported that the Trump Shuttle took off late on its debut flight after Trump had run many ads saying it would be the most on-time airline in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/reporter-donald-trump-mocked-spent-day-mogul-1989-article-1.2448381?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Daily News</u></a> story looking back at Kovaleski&rsquo;s history with Trump included an archived image of his bylined Trump Shuttle story (&quot;Wings of Don&quot;) with a photograph of Trump cutting a ceremonial ribbon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovelski at the rally, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/11/26/donald-trump-mocks-reporter-with-disability-berman-sot-ac.cnn\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>calling him a &quot;nice reporter.&quot;</u></a> He also described him as &quot;the poor guy&quot; and indicated he knew Kovaleski&rsquo;s appearance (&quot;you gotta see this guy&quot;) before launching into his imitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the candidate repeatedly denied knowing the reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Serge Kovaleski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him from decades ago -- if I ever met him at all, which I doubt. He should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a paper that is rapidly going down the tubes,&quot; Trump said, getting in a shot at the <em>New York Times</em>, in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an ad from Priorities USA Action, parents of a disabled child said Trump &quot;mocked&quot; a disabled reporter at a campaign rally. Trump did mimic the man&rsquo;s oddly angled right hand while flailing his arms and shouting in a strange voice. Disabled people and advocates&nbsp;said the candidate clearly was mocking him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s excuses for his comments are at odds with the evidence. Trump said<strong> </strong>he didn&rsquo;t remember the man so he couldn&rsquo;t know he was handicapped. But Kovaleski said he and Trump knew each other well because the reporter regularly covered the New York businessman for years. Archived reports support that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also talked about the reporter with familiarity as a &quot;nice reporter&quot; and a &quot;poor guy&quot; who &quot;you gotta see.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s denials that he did not mock -- or even know -- the disabled reporter don&rsquo;t add up.
