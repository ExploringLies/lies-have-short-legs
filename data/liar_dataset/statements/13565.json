And the article is 100 percent fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, a search of <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/obama-subjects.html\">all of Obama&rsquo;s executive orders</a> shows that he never issued an order banning Christmas cards to the military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/about/inside-white-house/holidays-2016\">2016 White House holiday website</a> prompts visitors to send a <a href=\"https://www.uso.org/holiday-form\">USO e-card</a> to members of the military. One of the pre-written message options is, &quot;We are grateful for all you do. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tdtalliance.com article quotes a Hyman Stratcher, litigation director at the Liberty Institute. The Liberty Institute is a real right-wing advocacy group based in Texas, but Stratcher is a made-up person. (The institute&rsquo;s real head of litigation is named <a href=\"https://firstliberty.org/team/hiram-sasser/\">Hiram Sasser</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article also quotes Imam Al-Suq Akweer of the Islamic Friendship Coalition, and neither the person nor the organization are real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the article includes an image that has been edited to look like an on-air Fox News report featuring anchor <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/person/m/martha-maccallum.html\">Martha MacCallum</a>, captioned, &quot;Obama orders ban on all Christmas cards to overseas servicemen. Pentagon to censor all outgoing mail that appears to be Christmas themed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Fox has <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/tag/war-christmas\">published numerous stories</a> about the so-called &quot;War on Christmas,&quot; they did not run this fabricated story about banning Christmas cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zKwMRMKQorXG-pUQkP-Lipx7o6XFFit_uMZvkR3nPUUX-dvnEETu5HOe1gzFRCHG_veeJGStooZL2x4_PxGvaFofQxmHeJdPPXmMFk1DJ2-tQ0I7SPr7Pctl8q-SLmhEzO8ezu8i\" style=\"border:none; height:283px; width:502px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Side note: In researching this fact-check, we came across a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/12/25/va-hospital-refuses-to-accept-merry-christmas-cards.html\">2013 Fox article</a> that says a Veterans Administration hospital in Dallas refused to accept cards that say &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot; However, that article is misleading because <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150407155527/http://www.fox4news.com/story/24293539/students-parents-upset-that-religious-christmas-cards-wont-go-to-north-texas-veterans\">it does not explain that</a> a VA chaplain reviews and distributes Christmas cards to veterans who want to receive cards with a religious message. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Tdtalliance.com <a href=\"http://www.tdtalliance.com/2015/11/obama-launches-first-salvo-in-war-on.html \">posted the same article</a> in 2015.
