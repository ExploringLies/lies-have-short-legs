The post was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fake news, but it still has been shared on the site more than 75,000 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com is a site that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/22/blog-posting/mega-pastor-john-hagee-wants-jail-women-who-use-go/\">we&rsquo;ve written about</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/02/blog-posting/trump-adviser-steve-bannon-did-not-say-its-ok-beat/\">in other fact-checks</a>, and <a href=\"http://uspoln.com/contact/\">identifies itself</a> as &quot;a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than that, there&rsquo;s no indication the story is almost entirely fabricated. The domain is registered to an <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/uspoln.com\">address in Kosovo</a>. The site didn&rsquo;t respond to our attempts to contact them via email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story &mdash; which again, is fake &mdash; is <a href=\"http://politicops.com/price-better-budget-cancer-patients-die-quickly/\">actually from a March 16 post</a> on Politicops.com, a different fake news site. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which <a href=\"http://politicops.com/about-us/\">refers to itself in a disclaimer</a> as &quot;the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.&quot; The Politicops.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, at an <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/politicops.com\">address in Israel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there&rsquo;s no way to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the disorienting details are compounded because the &quot;facts&quot; of the Politicops.com story are <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/we-dont-want-to-take-care-away-tom-price-lies-to-cancer-survivor-saved-by-obamacare/\">plagiarized directly from a news article</a> on RawStory.com. That piece recounted an exchange about Medicaid between Price, who is a former GOP congressman from Georgia, and a man at a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/15/politics/tom-price-town-hall-cnntv/\">CNN town hall event</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Kline, who said he voted for President Donald Trump, noted he was using Medicaid, the federal health program for the very poor, to be treated for cancer. Kline asked Price why he wanted to stop the expansion of Medicaid as outlined in the Affordable Care Act. Price said he considered the entire program to be riddled with problems. The back-and-forth illustrated that Price does want to draw back access to Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake comments in the made-up story, however, echo a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alan-grayson-die-quickly-comment-prompts-uproar/\">real accusation made in 2009</a> by former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, a Florida Democrat, during debate on the Affordable Care Act. Grayson admonished GOP opposition to the bill by saying on the House floor that &quot;If you get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Price did not use the words Politicops.com attributed to him by saying the budget would benefit more from cancer patients who gave up and died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-21T12:41:22.371205", "ruling_date": "2017-03-21T12:57:35", "ruling_headline": "Fake quote: Tom Price did not tell cancer patients to die more quickly", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-quote-tom-price-did-not-tell-cancer-patients-", "ruling_link_text": "Made-up details from a real forum", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>USPOLN.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://uspoln.com/2017/03/17/tom-price-better-budget-cancer-patients-die-quickly/\">Tom Price: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly&rsquo;</a>,&quot; March 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicops.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://politicops.com/price-better-budget-cancer-patients-die-quickly/\">Tom Price: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly&rsquo;</a>,&quot; March 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RawStory.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/we-dont-want-to-take-care-away-tom-price-lies-to-cancer-survivor-saved-by-obamacare/\">&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want to take care away&rsquo;: Tom Price lies to cancer survivor saved by Obamacare</a>,&quot; March 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/15/politics/tom-price-town-hall-cnntv/\">HHS Secretary vows GOP health care bill is &#39;so much better&#39; than Obamacare</a>,&quot; March 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alan-grayson-die-quickly-comment-prompts-uproar/\">Alan Grayson &lsquo;Die Quickly&rsquo; Comment Prompts Uproar</a>,&quot; Sept. 30, 2009</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said, &quot;It&rsquo;s better for our budget if cancer patients die more quickly.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2017-03-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
