In the face of political opposition, mainly from Republicans but also from some Democrats, the White House has readied a more limited approach in a package of executive orders aimed at reducing gun violence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVice President Joe Biden outlined those measures in a press conference Tuesday, emphasizing that President Barack Obama will still press for a new law. In making the case, Biden said, &quot;Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan. Pretty astounding. Pretty astounding. And Iraq, as a matter of fact. Over 5,000. That&#39;s no way to run a country.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObama repeated Biden&rsquo;s stat in a tweet. Readers asked us if the number was right, so we decided to take a look at his numbers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe White House press office told us that Biden was speaking about American casualties since the start of the war in Afghanistan. That number is 2,106, according a <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf\">fact sheet updated daily</a> by the U.S. Defense Department. Another tally, maintained by the Associated Press, shows nearly the same figure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirearm deaths are more difficult to count. Biden relied on a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/12/gun_death_tally_every_american_gun_death_since_newtown_sandy_hook_shooting.html\">database assembled by Slate,</a> an online magazine. The numbers there come from average people who send links of newspaper stories about gun deaths in their communities; we found no duplicate entries. This approach is likely to undercount deaths, and it still shows some 5,176 fatalities in the six months since Newtown.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe numbers back up Biden&rsquo;s claim. In a span of half a year, there were more than 5,000 gun fatalities in the United States. In a dozen years, fewer than half that number of Americans died in the war in Afghanistan. Biden also referred to Iraq. Deaths there reached 4,422, according to the Pentagon. That&rsquo;s higher, but still less than fatalities due to firearms in America since mid December, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe should note that Slate&rsquo;s statistics don&rsquo;t distinguish among suicides, homicides, accidents and law enforcement actions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso, Biden&#39;s comparison doesn&#39;t take into account that the deaths occurred in populations of very different size.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Biden said &quot;that&rsquo;s no way to run a country&quot;, that would take in the entire U.S. population. We calculated the death rates implicit in his claim. When you do the math for the 5,176 gun deaths and the population base is over 316 million, the rate turns out to be .016 per 1,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo make the same calculation for American service fatalities in Afghanistan, we contacted the Defense Department to determine the number of people at risk. The total number of soldiers deployed in that country for Operation Enduring Freedom is a bit over 823,000. The death rate comes out to 2.56 per 1,000. That&rsquo;s nearly 150 times bigger than the death rate by guns in the United States since Newtown.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA similar calculation for Operation Iraqi Freedom yielded a rate of 3.97 deaths per 1,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo get a longer term view of firearm fatalities in America, we <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_injury_reports.html\">went to a database run by</a> the Centers for Disease Control. There we learned that between 2001 and 2010, the rate was .103 per 1,000. That&rsquo;s higher than the rate since Newtown but still 25 times smaller than for the Afghanistan war.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLastly, it&rsquo;s important to note that one expects deaths in a war zone. The gun deaths in the United States represent deaths during peacetime.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBiden said America has lost more people to guns since Newtown than it has in the war in Afghanistan. He is correct that more than twice as many people died in the past six months as did in 12 years of fighting. We rate his statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-20T11:05:00.936731", "ruling_date": "2013-06-20T14:54:09", "ruling_headline": "Biden: Since Newtown, more American gun deaths than soldiers lost in Afghanistan", "ruling_headline_slug": "biden-newtown-more-american-gun-deaths-soldiers-lo", "ruling_link_text": "Grim numbers, but accurate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama Twitter feed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/347057653089988608\">Biden on gun deaths</a>, June 18, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tABC News,<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/joe-biden-gun-control-speech-vice-president-pushes-19429372\"> Biden gun control speech</a>, June 18, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Defense Department, <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf\">Casualty count</a>, June 19, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/feb/20/paul-broun/congressman-uses-wrong-words-gun-claim/\"> Congressman uses wrong words on gun claim</a>, February 20, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSlate,<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2012/12/gun_death_tally_every_american_gun_death_since_newtown_sandy_hook_shooting.html\"> How many people have been killed by guns since Newtown?</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Census,<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popclock/\"> Population Clock</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interview with Nate Christensen, Defense Department Press Office, June 19, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCenters for Disease Control,<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_injury_reports.html\"> National Electronic Injury Surveillance System -- Fatal Injury Reports</a>, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRAND,<a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/documented_briefings/DB587.html\"> Army Deployments to OIF and OEF</a>, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNational Academies Press,<a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12812&amp;page=17\"> Returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan</a>, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMany Eyes,<a href=\"http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/datasets/2c3b53f082cd11df9d75000255111976/versions/1\"> Number of OIF/OEF by state</a>, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.iraqbodycount.org/\">Iraq Body Count</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Guardian,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/aug/10/afghanistan-civilian-casualties-statistics\"> Afghanistan civilian casualties</a>, April 12, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 10, "first_name": "Joe", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Delaware", "id": 11, "last_name": "Biden", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "joe-biden", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-joebiden.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/11/", "total_count": 78, "true_count": 13, "website": "http://www.joebiden.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet from Barack Obama's Twitter feed", "statement_date": "2013-06-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
