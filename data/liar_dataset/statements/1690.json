Once he steps down -- and unless President Barack Obama appoints another Protestant to take his place -- there will be no more Protestants on the bench. Justice David Souter, who left the court in 2009, is Episcopalian, a religion that combines both Protestant and Catholic traditions. He was replaced by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Catholic. <br /><br />In addition to Sotomayor, five of the justices are Catholic, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.<br /><br />Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsberg are Jewish. <br /><br />So, why all this discussion of Stevens' religious affiliation? If anything, it says a lot about how the demographics of the court have changed over the years. Historically speaking, the religious affiliations of the current court are quite unusual, according to a report and study done by NPR's Nina Totenberg. For decades, the court was majority Protestant, she reports. It was Catholics and Jews who were the anomaly. <br /><br />That shift is even more pronounced when you look at the nation's religious affiliations. According to the CIA World Factbook, a little more 50 percent of Americans identify as Protestant. Catholics make up about 24 percent of the population, while Jews represent about 1.7 percent of the population. <br /><br />So, back to Colbert's claim. He's correct that Stevens is a Protestant and he's the last one on the Supreme Court bench. Colbert's first statement on the Truth-O-Meter gets a True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-14T10:52:20.341528", "ruling_date": "2010-04-14T19:54:17", "ruling_headline": "Colbert claims Justice John Paul Stevens is the last Protestant on the Supreme Court", "ruling_headline_slug": "colbert-claims-justice-john-paul-stevens-last-prot", "ruling_link_text": "On the Supreme Court, Protestants are a dying breed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Colbert Report, <a href=\"http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270710/april-12-2010/justice-stevens-replacement---jeffrey-toobin\" target=\"_blank\">April 12, 2010, episode</a><br /><br />The Supreme Court Web site, <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">justice biographies</a>, accessed April 14, 2010 <br /><br />National Public Radio, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125641988\" target=\"_blank\">Supreme Court May Soon Lack Protestant Justices</a>, by Nina Totenberg, April 7, 2010<br /><br />Adherents, <a href=\"http://www.adherents.com/adh_sc.html\" target=\"_blank\">Religious Affiliation of the U.S. Supreme Court</a>, accessed April 13, 2010<br /><br />The CIA World Factbook, <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html\" target=\"_blank\">The United States</a>, accessed April 14, 2010<br /><br />The Episcopal Church, <a href=\"http://www.episcopalchurch.org/visitors_8950_ENG_HTM.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Visitor's Center page</a>, accessed April 14, 2010<br /><br />New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/weekinreview/11liptak.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stevens, the Only Protestant on the Supreme Court</a>, by Adam Liptak, April 9, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Stephen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 378, "last_name": "Colbert", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "stephen-colbert", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/StephenColbertWEB.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/378/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>John Paul Stevens is the only Protestant on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>", "statement_context": "an interview on Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report\"", "statement_date": "2010-04-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 9, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/9/", "subject": "Religion", "subject_slug": "religion", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 108, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/108/", "subject": "Supreme Court", "subject_slug": "supreme-court", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 152, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/152/", "subject": "The Colbert Report", "subject_slug": "colbert-report", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
