Chris Christie warns they&rsquo;ll become ravenous. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesn&rsquo;t tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didn&rsquo;t have an income tax, but then &quot;Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Here&#39;s the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that&#39;s up,&quot; Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid New Jersey&rsquo;s income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the state&rsquo;s income tax is clear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1976 -- during Byrne&rsquo;s first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in today&rsquo;s dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIncome in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the state&rsquo;s rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. That&rsquo;s true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jersey&rsquo;s current income tax system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said, &quot;The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEvery other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/chris_christie_income_tax.html\">NJ.com</a>. </p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-02T16:11:13.307037", "ruling_date": "2012-10-03T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie says state income tax jumped from 2 percent when it was first enacted to 9 percent now", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-says-state-income-tax-jumped-2-perc", "ruling_link_text": "True for top rate, not others", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV9OCF_vV8w\">Chris Christie speaks for Ovide Lamontage in Atkinson NH</a>, Sept. 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Valley Patriot Newspaper&rsquo;s YouTube Account, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WWc8SPjJmc\">New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in NH for Ovide Lamontagne</a>, Sept. 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/git_over.shtml\">Gross Income Tax: Overview</a>, updated Sept. 27, 2010, accessed Sept. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/current/njtaxratesch.pdf\">Tax Rate Schedules: 2011</a>, accessed Sept. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFitzgerald&rsquo;s Legislative Manual, State of New Jersey, 1976-2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Office of Legislative Services, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/PropertyTaxSession/OPI/bg75.pdf\">New Jersey Tax Revenue Trends and the Growing</a><br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/PropertyTaxSession/OPI/bg75.pdf\">Importance of the Gross Income Tax</a>, Jan. 2003, accessed Oct.1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">CPI Inflation Calculator</a>, accessed Oct. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState of New Jersey, Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/pubs/soi_tables2009.pdf\">Statistics of Income: 2009</a>, Summer 2011, accessed Oct. 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Associated Press, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/new-hampshire/2012/09/25/gov-christie-campaigns-for-gop-candidate/VELmjcjKXjyVgZVDy9yEdJ/story.html\">NJ Gov.
