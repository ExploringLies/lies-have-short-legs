The senator, in the middle of his second term, is hoping to garner support for fellow Democrat Ted Strickland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Outside special interests like to spend money in Ohio,&quot; Brown&rsquo;s email said. &quot;Back in 2012, they spent $40 million trying to buy my seat in the Senate. &hellip; Right now, the special interests are up to $30 million spent against Ted -- with the Koch network spending more money in Ohio than anywhere else in the country.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland, the former Ohio governor, is running for Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman in one of the tightest races in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, of Koch Industries, are tied as the sixth-richest people in the world, each worth an estimated $42 billion. As political and policy influencers advancing a free-market agenda, their network includes the nonprofit Americans for Prosperity and the super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kochs can usually be counted on to fund conservative causes, but they have <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/the_koch_brothers_were_supposed_to_buy_the_2016_election_what_happened.html\">recoiled </a>from the 2016 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/mike-pence-koch-brothers-225549\">presidential </a>race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is down-ballot spending in Ohio the Koch&rsquo;s biggest imprint so far in the 2016 elections?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned first to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics for its tallies of outside contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Koch brothers, through their political action network, have spent approximately $8 million in the senate race in Ohio, with almost <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/recips.php?cmte=C90013285&amp;cycle=2016\">$2 million</a> from Americans for Prosperity and a little over<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/recips.php?cmte=C00564765&amp;cycle=2016\"> $6 million</a> from Freedom Partners Action Fund. That is more than the Koch-backed groups have spent in any other race in the country, according to OpenSecrets records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Koch network&rsquo;s next-largest spending, by comparison, is in North Carolina, where Americans for Prosperity has spent a mere $200,000 against <a href=\"http://ellmers.house.gov/\">Rep. Renee Ellmers</a>, and in Pennsylvania, where Freedom Partners Action Fund has spent almost $3 million in opposition to <a href=\"http://katiemcginty.com/\">Katie McGinty</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In opposition spending by Freedom Partners, Strickland has &quot;taken the most punishment&quot; in 2016 to date, the Center for Responsive Politics <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/07/the-kochs-versus-their-machine/\">reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So&nbsp;the Koch network is contributing substantially to help Portman keep his seat. But where did Brown get the &quot;$30 million spent against Ted&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the numbers for outside spending contributions in the Ohio senate race, according to OpenSecrets.org:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Outside spending Portman Strickland.JPG\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3lOQIljJqa0W3hI9Qox48ykGt95jw7fFKTIek0j-2KAWduOwToVYDHGBjLMlAFoDsgWzUilj0jiXxq54VIjaNuvKNxoxhNMtyQsLeUN1jRCGg2yco1U-sMgaNWq9YLYh_K9WX9gQ\" style=\"border:none; height:124px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you add the total outside spending for Portman, and the spending against Strickland, you get $19,232,784. (We&rsquo;re leaving out the primary race spending for the other Democratic candidate, P.G. Sittenfeld, who Strickland beat -- that&rsquo;s the difference between our total and the $19,990,270 above.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where does the other $10 million come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland spokesman David Bergstein told PolitiFact Ohio that, in tracking money spent against the candidate, the campaign monitors <a href=\"http://www.onenationamerica.org/one-nations-new-ohio-ad-highlights-local-youngstown-business-struggles-obamacare/\">announcements </a>of advertising purchases, some of which come from 501(c)(4) organizations that don&rsquo;t have to report to the Federal Election Commission. Those dollars, therefore, don&rsquo;t appear on sites like OpenSecrets.org. Counting announcements of spending from these nonprofits, the conservative estimate is closer to $30 million, the campaign said. Bergstein provided a spreadsheet confirming that figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s campaign isn&rsquo;t suffering from a lack of outside spending as much as Brown&rsquo;s email might suggest. <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/01/senate-majority-pac-2/\">Senate Majority PAC</a>, a super PAC dedicated to putting Democrats in Senate seats, has spent $8.4 million against Portman and $1.8 million for Strickland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shared our analysis with Freedom Partners Action PAC, and the group did not dispute our findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fundraising email in support of Strickland said that the billionaire-backed Koch network has devoted the most money to oppose the Ohio senate candidate than in any other race in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans for Prosperity and the Freedom Partners Action Fund have spent about $8 million to oppose Strickland, which is more than they&rsquo;ve dropped in any other race this election season to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s campaign, while hardly immune to special interests, is the Koch network&rsquo;s biggest target in an election year that has seen conservative benefactors steer clear of the main ticket. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim True.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/02ec27ef-fd3d-4b70-92d0-d9c1440cfcc6\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/02ec27ef-fd3d-4b70-92d0-d9c1440cfcc6</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-28T18:23:25.807654", "ruling_date": "2016-07-28T18:35:43", "ruling_headline": "Are Koch-backed groups spending most for Ohio Senate race?", "ruling_headline_slug": "are-koch-backed-groups-spending-most-ohio-senate-r", "ruling_link_text": "Koch and a smile", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, David Bergstein, Strickland for Senate, July 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slate.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/the_koch_brothers_were_supposed_to_buy_the_2016_election_what_happened.html\">The Koch Brothers were supposed to buy the 2016 election</a>,&quot; May 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/06/ohio-senate-race-attracts-highest-outside-spending-in-congress-big-share-of-dark-money/\">Ohio Senate race attracts highest outside spending in Congress, big share of dark money</a>,&quot; Jun. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/trump-megadonors-koch-222825\">What the Kochs think about Trump now</a>,&quot; May 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/11/11/charles-koch-no-backing-candidate-republican-primary/75576772/?siteID=je6NUbpObpQ-NbRakSrtRSRhgT_2irMyLQ\">Charles Koch has no plans to back a candidate in the Republican primar</a>y,&quot; Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Sherrod", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 387, "last_name": "Brown", "mostly_true_count": 9, "name_slug": "sherrod-brown", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-sherrod-brown2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/387/", "total_count": 37, "true_count": 14, "website": "http://www.brown.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The Koch network (is) spending more money (in a Senate race) in Ohio than anywhere else in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "fundraising email", "statement_date": "2016-07-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "@SherrodBrown makes fund plea for @Ted_Strickland and cites Koch opposition"}
