But beyond the initial quotes about Rivera hating airlines and Smith suggesting United faced too much regulation, the story is completely made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the story, Smith began ranting about how airlines were over-regulated and how Dao&rsquo;s East Asian racial background rightfully made other passengers nervous in a post-Sept. 11 world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American,&quot; Smith was falsely quoted as saying. &quot;As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the video of what happened on the plane, it&rsquo;s obvious that his behavior suggests that he&rsquo;s from another part of the world, and that&rsquo;s that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s more to the story, but it&rsquo;s so ridiculous we&rsquo;ll stop there. The <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/uspoln.com\">privately registered</a> USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) said in its <a href=\"http://uspoln.com/about-us/\">About Us link</a> that it is a &quot;hybrid News/Satire platform to provide the latest and breaking news for for Political, Government, Cultural, and Religion news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only that, but the post links to the original source of the article, a website called Politicass.com, which <a href=\"http://politicass.com/fox-news-sandra-smith-everybody-see-united-airlines-passengers-behavior-not-genuine-american/\">posted the story on April 12</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicass.com is part of the Newslo.com family of parody sites.

But on other sites without the buttons, there&rsquo;s no way to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com used an already fake story from Politicass.com and removed the only indication the post was fake.
