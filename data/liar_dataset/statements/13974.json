Mike Rogers, R-Ala., introduced the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017 to levy a 2 percent fee on money sent by individuals in the United States to recipients in nations &quot;south of the U.S. border,&quot; funds known as remittances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This bill is simple &ndash; anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall,&quot; Rogers said in a March 30 <a href=\"https://mikerogers.house.gov/press-release/rogers-introduces-bill-tax-illegal-immigrants-help-fund-border-wall\">press release</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added some large numbers about remittances to bolster his&nbsp;case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the U.S. to their home countries,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remittances serve as a source of income for migrants&rsquo; families who generally use the money to pay for housing, food and other living expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To an extent, Rogers&rsquo; two-fold statement is backed by data. The exception is his point about South America &mdash; we could not find any countries on that continent with remittances anywhere near 15 percent of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Money sent to Mexico checks out</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers&rsquo; bill seeks to tax immigrants living in the United States illegally who send money back to their countries, according to a press release from his office. The text of the bill itself does not explicitly address how people here unlawfully could be targeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts have told us that while undocumented immigrants do send remittances, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/apr/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-most-wire-transfers-mexico-are/\">hard to determine</a> how much they send, since U.S. citizens and immigrants living here legally also send money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico receives more money from U.S. residents than does any other nation, by far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers&rsquo; statement about remittances sent to Mexico is based on data from the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migrationremittancesdiasporaissues/brief/migration-remittances-data\">World Bank</a>. The World Bank has for several years estimated the bilateral flow of remittances from its member countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest number is actually higher than what Rogers said. Mexico received more than $25.6 billion in remittances from individuals in the United States in 2015, according to the most recent World Bank estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico also topped the list as the country receiving the most remittances from the United States from 2010-15, according to a May 2016 Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43217.pdf\">report</a>. China came in second and India placed third.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Money sent to South and Central American countries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers claimed that some South and Central American countries receive more than 15 percent of their gross domestic product, or GDP, in the form of remittances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked what countries he had in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson&nbsp;pointed to Haiti, a poor island in the Caribbean, as well as Honduras and El Salvador in Central America. (The spokesperson added that Rogers&#39; statement was actually based on 2015 data, not 2014.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A country&rsquo;s GDP is an indicator of the health and size of its economy. Comparing remittances to a country&rsquo;s GDP can be helpful in understanding the economic effects of foreign labor migration and money sent to residents across countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, a large remittance total may be less eye-popping when it&rsquo;s compared to the broader economy &mdash; and vice versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For example, if I tell you that in 2015, Mexico received $26 billion in remittances and Haiti received $2.2 billion, you might think that remittances are far more important to the Mexican economy than they are to Haiti&#39;s,&quot; said Roy Germano, a New York University professor who has researched migrants&rsquo; remittances. &quot;But the fact is, Mexico&#39;s economy is much larger than Haiti&#39;s (as is its population).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remittances to Haiti represent a much greater share of income for the country than they do in Mexico. In 2015, remittances from the United States accounted for more than 15 percent of Haiti&rsquo;s GDP and about 2.2&nbsp;percent of Mexico&rsquo;s GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Small island states or small, impoverished countries are most likely to have shares of remittances at 15 percent or more of GDP, said Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes, professor and chair of the economics department at San Diego State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tajikistan, in Central Asia, has depended on remittances since years-long armed conflict in the 1990s claimed more than 100,000 lives, noted the Congressional Research Service&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43217.pdf\">report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tajikistan topped a CRS list as the country with the greatest percentage of its 2014 GDP in form of remittances (from all places), at nearly 42 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers&rsquo; office did not provide any examples of countries from South America with remittances via the United States that amount to more than 15 percent of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We crunched the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vjGygihrLZ8LP0T55doMT-0VMromxwnoTaT5rU4GPJQ/edit?usp=sharing\">numbers for South America</a> and found that none came close to 15 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Percent of Guyana&rsquo;s GDP in form of remittances? 5.9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ecuador:&nbsp;1.02 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colombia:&nbsp;0.5 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolivia:&nbsp;0.4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brazil: 0.04 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venezuela: 0.01 percent (based on 2013 GDP/remittances data)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers said, &quot;In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on World Bank estimates, Mexico did receive more than $24 billion in remittances from the United States in 2015 (the year Rogers meant to use).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers would have been on safer ground in the second part of his statement had he described nations south of the border more generally. According to the latest data, a couple of countries in Central America &mdash; El Salvador and Honduras &mdash; received at least 15 percent of their GDP from remittances. Haiti, in the Caribbean, also received at least 15 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No country&nbsp;from South America reached that threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Rogers&#39; statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-11T12:43:14.507075", "ruling_date": "2017-04-11T16:00:03", "ruling_headline": "Congressman proposes new tax on remittances to pay for Trump's border wall.
