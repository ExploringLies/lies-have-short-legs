Charlie Crist and Marco  Rubio, the former House speaker said that Social Security needs to be  reformed or it will go bankrupt.<br /><br />\"Social Security, whether we  want it to or not, in its current form cannot survive and will not exist  for us,\" he said during the March 28, 2010, showdown on FOX News  Sunday. \"In fact, just this week we received the news that for the first  time Social Security is now paying out more in benefits than it's  taking in. That was something that was supposed to happen in 2016. It's  now happening in 2010.\"<br /><br />Calls to reform Social Security are  nothing new; many economic analysts say that the program is  unsustainable. But privatizing the program has become a hallmark of the  conservative agenda. Its latest proponent is Wisconsin Congressman Paul  Ryan, who is the top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives'  Budget Committee. His <a href=\"http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Roadmap for  America's Future</a> would reduce Social Security benefits for those who  are 55 or younger in 2011 and supplement the reduction with private  accounts.<br /><br />On March 24, that argument was put in the spotlight  again, when the Congressional Budget Office, the independent  number-crunching arm of Congress, issued some sobering news: This year,  the Social Security Administration will take in less than it pays out,  resulting in an approximately $29 billion shortfall. <br /><br />The  projections are part of its yearly analysis of President Barack Obama's  budget. <br /><br />In an interview with the <em>New York Times,</em> Stephen C.  Goss, chief actuary of the SSA, explained the problem. He said that the  recession has put people out of jobs and more people have applied for  benefits sooner than expected. Simultaneously, fewer jobs means fewer  paychecks are going out and that translates to less collected by the  government in taxes. In the same interview, Gross pointed out that the  SSA has a $2.5 trillion balance that will carry benefits for a while. <br /><br />So,  Rubio's correct on the first part his claim.<br /><br />He's right on his  second point as well. In its May 2009 annual report to Congress, the SSA  projected that \"annual cost will exceed tax income starting in 2016.\" <br /><br />As  a result, we find Rubio's claim to be True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-28T15:30:01.961528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-28T16:14:21", "ruling_headline": "Rubio claims Social Security is upside down sooner than expected", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-claims-social-security-upside-down-sooner-ex", "ruling_link_text": "Fresh off the news, he's right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Congressional Quarterly, transcript of the Crist-Rubio debate, March 28,  2010<br /><br />Rep.
