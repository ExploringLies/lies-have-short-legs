She&rsquo;s running against Republican John Adcock, who was appointed to the seat in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;John Adcock wants to join politicians who took thousands from insurance companies and support letting them deny health care coverage,&quot; a narrator in the ad says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Their plan would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claims are vague, leaving PolitiFact to wonder which plan by legislative Republicans would eliminate coverage for North Carolina families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first quote is a reference to Republicans refusing to expand Medicaid, said Benjamin Woods, Batch&rsquo;s campaign manager. It&rsquo;s been well-documented that expanding Medicaid in North Carolina could provide coverage for up to 500,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s move on to the second quote. Woods said it refers to legislative Republicans&rsquo; &quot;work to undermine the positive impact of the Affordable Care Act in North Carolina.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Woods referenced a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article213158739.html\">Charlotte Observer editorial</a>&nbsp;about a Republican proposal this summer that would&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article213129969.html\">allow nonprofit organizations to offer health benefits</a>&nbsp;to their members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An alternative to the ACA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health benefit plans, which exist in other states but aren&rsquo;t available in North Carolina, can be cheaper than typical health insurance because they&rsquo;re not regulated and don&rsquo;t have to meet financial solvency requirements for sufficient funds to pay customers&rsquo; medical bills, The News &amp; Observer reported in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plans don&rsquo;t cover mental health benefits or preventive health services, unlike health insurance regulated under the ACA. (Although, in some cases, customers can pay extra for that coverage.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics, including The Charlotte Observer editorial board, fear the nonprofit benefit plans would lure healthy customers away from ACA plans, &quot;which in turn would force insurers to raise premiums even more to cover the costs of the less healthy folks and elderly who remain on Obamacare.&quot; The Observer&rsquo;s editorial continued: &quot;The result: Obamacare will be gutted. So will its preexisting conditions benefit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill&rsquo;s intention is indeed to provide healthy North Carolinians an alternative to subsidizing insurance for unhealthy people, said David Anderson, a research associate for Duke University&rsquo;s Margolis Center for Health Policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a cynical dodge, but a legal one,&quot; Anderson said. And it &quot;would harm a small group of families who have significant medical conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The plan and Adcock</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill wouldn&rsquo;t directly eliminate coverage, as the ad suggests. But it could drive up prices for ACA customers, prompting customers with the highest premiums to leave the marketplace altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;d probably start seeing price changes if 10,000 to 20,000 (healthy ACA customers) leave the risk pool,&quot; Anderson said. Eventually, he said, people with pre-existing conditions and the poor &quot;will have to make the decision between paying the mortgage and paying for insurance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www2.ncleg.net/BillLookup/2017/H933\">bill</a>, however, never became law. And Adcock hasn&rsquo;t expressed support for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an email to PolitiFact, Adcock said he doesn&rsquo;t know the specifics of the bill. But, &quot;I know that many Republicans in the State House had many concerns with this bill as written, and I agree with them that the bill in its current form should not pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think that if non-profit organizations want to offer health insurance to their members, they should be bound by consumer protections and have to cover all of their members, regardless of pre-existing conditions,&quot; Adcock continued. &quot;While I&rsquo;m open to considering a bill authorizing self-funded health benefit plans for non-profit organizations, I would need to review an extensive and objective analysis of its impacts before I could determine if such a bill is in the best interest of my constituents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Batch&rsquo;s commercial suggests a plan supported by John Adcock and legislative Republicans &quot;would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us.&quot; Her campaign manager cited a bill that would have provided an alternative option to the Affordable Care Act. While that bill could ultimately destabilize the ACA marketplace, causing premiums to rise, it doesn&rsquo;t directly eliminate coverage. It didn&rsquo;t have enough support to pass and Adcock says he opposes it. We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters&rsquo; Lab and PolitiFact.
