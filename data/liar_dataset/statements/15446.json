Gov. Dan Patrick told a national TV audience after the May 2018 Santa Fe High School shootings that he doesn&rsquo;t see a need for more gun regulation in that Texas already bars children from having loaded weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check Patrick&#39;s reference to law given that the admitted Santa Fe shooter <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/texas/article/Survivors-of-Texas-massacre-confront-spiritual-12930099.php\">reportedly used</a> his father&rsquo;s shotgun and handgun in the attack. Our research identified the 1995 law, though we also&nbsp;learned it wouldn&rsquo;t apply to the Santa Fe incident due to the shooter&rsquo;s age of 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick, taking questions from George Stephanopoulos on the May 20, 2017, edition of ABC&#39;s&nbsp;<em>This Week</em>, <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.youtube.com_watch-3Fv-3DgVHV6difosE&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=QvQrCjPtO9cKGOfGYlNgXQ&amp;r=gMzwfpRdYrNiKB230pQwEHvOg7yPnZ8KN6yHpK9HhxY&amp;m=1EAArqmHjwniJVxZDQUsaYL6EZD7lHvZGht5gIR8ReM&amp;s=JW0CyqnLT6czL19wmn65_1e0QozlnrjyvlY558imHzg&amp;e=\">said</a>: &quot;We have to look at ourselves, George. It&rsquo;s not about the guns. It&rsquo;s about us. Can there be gun regulation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Gun control, I believe, starts at home, George. Every person who owns a gun must be accountable for their guns at home,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;We don&rsquo;t know all the facts yet. But this particular young man got his guns in some way from his parents&rsquo; home. You should have your guns locked up. It&rsquo;s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child, for example.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Law confirmed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our online search for such a law led us to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lawcenter.giffords.org/child-access-prevention-in-texas/\">web page</a> about preventing Texas children from getting guns created by the San Francisco-based <a href=\"http://lawcenter.giffords.org/about/mission/\">Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a>. That page says Texas has a law holding a person criminally liable if he or she, &quot;with criminal negligence,&quot; fails to secure a &quot;readily dischargeable&quot; firearm and a child under age 17 gains access to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we turned to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm\">section 46.13 of the Texas penal code</a>, titled &quot;Making a Firearm Accessible to a Child,&quot; which defines a readily dischargeable firearm as one &quot;loaded with ammunition, whether or not a round is in the chamber.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law states: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:45pt\">&quot;A person commits an offense if a child gains access to a readily dischargeable firearm and the person with criminal negligence:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:45pt\">(1) &nbsp;failed to secure the firearm; &nbsp;or</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:45pt\">(2) &nbsp;left the firearm in a place to which the person knew or should have known the child would gain access.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the law, &quot;secure&quot; means &quot;to take steps that a reasonable person would take to prevent the access to a readily dischargeable firearm by a child, including but not limited to placing a firearm in a locked container or temporarily rendering the firearm inoperable by a trigger lock or other means.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law otherwise provides defenses to prosecution starting with whether the child&rsquo;s access was supervised by a person older than 18 and the firearm was for hunting, sporting &quot;or other lawful purposes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the law, a violation is a Class C misdemeanor or a Class A misdemeanor &quot;if the child discharges the firearm and causes death or serious bodily injury to himself or another person.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Legislative history</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislative records show the legislation creating the law won approval in 1995, the same year that then-state Sen. Jerry Patterson, R-Pasadena, shepherded into law the state&#39;s concealed-carry measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We connected with Patterson, who told us by email that the child-specific proposal, initiated by Rep. Al Edwards, D-Houston, had momentum that year in part due to testimony by a Houston couple who had lost their son to an accidental shooting. The boy&rsquo;s mother, Linda Tarr, testified at the time: &quot;This bill is to save children. It &nbsp;is not a gun-control bill. This is a gun-responsibility act, and children are our responsibility.&#39;&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effective law?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also wondered about the law&rsquo;s effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The April 1995 <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> news story where we spotted Tarr&rsquo;s testimony said that in 1993,&nbsp;42 children younger than 17 had been killed in accidents involving firearms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have lately been fewer such deaths, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v_XGiMCaezbUWkscGdzc0NF9rjpZCfGwNavD05pFlL8/edit?usp=sharing\">according to</a> figures we requested from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen emailed us a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v_XGiMCaezbUWkscGdzc0NF9rjpZCfGwNavD05pFlL8/edit?usp=sharing\">chart</a> indicating that in 2014-15, 11 Texas children younger than 17 were killed in accidents involving firearms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, Ari Freilich, a lawyer for the Giffords center, said by email that Texas is among 27 states with child access prevention laws potentially making&nbsp;adults legally accountable for letting minors gain unsupervised access to guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Freilich called the Texas law weaker than laws&nbsp;in some states because it only applies to adults who leave readily operable loaded firearms accessible to unsupervised minors. &quot;As a result, Texas&#39; law would likely not apply even if an adult left an unsupervised minor home alone with an unloaded firearm out on the table right next to a box of ammunition,&quot; Freilich wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Freilich said, the Texas law wouldn&#39;t apply to what evidently happened at Santa Fe High School because the admitted shooter was 17--and the law applies only to guns taken by minors 16 or younger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Santa Fe shootings, the center posted a <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__giffords.org_2018_05_texas-2Dpolicy-2Dmemo_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=QvQrCjPtO9cKGOfGYlNgXQ&amp;r=gMzwfpRdYrNiKB230pQwEHvOg7yPnZ8KN6yHpK9HhxY&amp;m=EL1lAfCiSQeejfqUmVGOhrScnthcPAzzHP12jdHTcv0&amp;s=6j4-GlbupR_QG-45AQrGEVDtcBvo_3Kaex1NrIwucSs&amp;e=\">memo</a> to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott stating the law should be amended, at the least, to apply to minors under 18 &quot;and to cases where an adult leaves unloaded firearms and ammunition accessible to the minor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also asked the NRA-tied Texas State Rifle Association about the law. By phone, Alice Gene Tripp praised it, saying: &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t try to criminalize how you store your guns. It simply puts a penalty in statute if you don&rsquo;t do it effectively. Texas allows adults to make adult decisions and penalizes those who don&rsquo;t do it correctly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick said: &quot;It&rsquo;s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 1995 state law makes it a misdemeanor if a person with criminal negligence fails to secure a loaded gun and a child younger than 17 accesses it or if a person leaves the gun where he or she knew or should have known the child would get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.
