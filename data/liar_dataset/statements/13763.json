He announced Gorsuch as that pick Jan. 31, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, Baldwin told the<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/02/tammy-baldwin-vote-no-trump-pick-neil-gorsuch-supreme-court/97402842/\"> Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> that she would support a filibuster to block the Gorsuch nomination, would vote against the Senate action required to block a filibuster and would vote against Gorsuch if he made it to a final vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that consistent with her position on Garland&rsquo;s nomination that the Senate should vote for a nominee in a timely manner?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought that was a question for the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has been consistent on an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not all votes created equal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Garland and Gorsuch nominations came up in dramatically different contexts &mdash; one a nominee late in a lame duck presidency, the other immediately after a highly divisive campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin &mdash; like most other senators &mdash; switched sides between the two nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an email, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus said the senator&rsquo;s position is consistent because she supported a hearing, a committee vote and a floor vote for both nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the voting claim isn&rsquo;t quite that simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figuring this out means diving into Senate rules of procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the minority party filibusters an initiative, as many Democrats have pledged to do with the Gorsuch nomination, the majority party can force a vote through a procedure called cloture. This effectively ends the filibuster by limiting the debate to 30 more hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For cloture to pass, it must be supported by 60 of the 100 senators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That creates a higher threshold for nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gorsuch would otherwise need only a majority to be approved &mdash; and the Republicans hold that majority. Cloture is unusual but not unprecedented, having been used<a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/83d4b792-d34b-4215-be6d-4a3c4e976d2b.pdf\"> four times</a> for Supreme Court nominees since 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kraus said Baldwin is consistent because she &quot;supports&quot; a cloture vote, even though she would vote against Gorsuch in that vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But cloture is a maneuver executed by the majority party (Republicans in this case), so Baldwin&rsquo;s &quot;support&quot; for that is both unnecessary and irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Cloture and the 60-vote threshold itself could also become irrelevant if Republicans choose to use what has been termed the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/03/6-questions-answered-about-nuclear-option-filibust/\">nuclear option</a>,&quot; a parliamentary procedure by which they can use majority votes to override the requirement for a supermajority, effectively overcoming a filibuster with just 51 votes. Democrats did this to push through Obama&rsquo;s lower court appointments in 2013, but it hasn&rsquo;t been used for a Supreme Court nominee.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin said during the Garland process the Senate should give him &quot;fair consideration,&quot; and she pledged the same thing to Gorsuch in a statement issued the day of his nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later she announced plans to vote against Gorsuch, before meeting with him or participating in any hearing process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov. Scott Walker labeled Baldwin a hypocrite<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWalker/status/827598391484043264\"> on Twitter</a> for telling others to meet with Garland but deciding on Gorsuch before meeting with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kraus said Baldwin had reviewed the backgrounds and records of Gorsuch and other finalists before Trump&rsquo;s announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that allowed time to give fair consideration before deciding she would oppose Gorsuch due to a &quot;record of ruling against disabled students, against workers and against women&rsquo;s reproductive health care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Baldwin&rsquo;s party put forth a Supreme Court nominee, she advocated for a &quot;timely vote&quot; and an &quot;up or down vote.&quot; A common-sense interpretation is that she wanted a final nomination vote, where passing meant being approved by the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now that Baldwin is in the minority and facing a Republican nominee, she is supporting a filibuster that creates a roadblock to reaching that final vote. Her claim to &quot;support&quot; a cloture vote makes no sense since that isn&rsquo;t up to her party &mdash; cloture would be pushed by Republicans and is only needed if Baldwin and other Democrats pursue a filibuster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that cloture vote would only advance the process, not result in a final decision on Gorsuch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what we call a Full Flop.</p> <div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"890eebe4-853d-40b4-92df-e224a294e38b\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ClaimReview\"> <div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div> <div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"> <div itemprop=\"name\"><a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">Politifact</a></div> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com/mediapage/jpgs/politifact-logo-big.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact\" /> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\">8</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"bestRating\">6</div> <img style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/fom-fullflop-pf.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" /> Politifact Rating: <div style=\"font-weight: bold\" itemprop=\"alternateName\"></div> </div> <div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\" itemprop=\"claimReviewed\">On whether the Senate should vote in a timely manner on a Supreme Court nominee.</div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\"> <div itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"> <div itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div itemprop=\"name\">Tammy Baldwin</div> <div itemprop=\"jobTitle\">U.S. senator, D-Wis.</div> </div> <img style=\"display:none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT_Tammy_Baldwin.jpg\" /> <div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\" itemprop=\"name\">Public comments</div> <div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Thursday, February 2, 2017</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">02/02/2017</div> </div> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/22/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-changes-views-how-quickly-act-suprem/\" itemprop=\"url\">Read More</a> <div style=\"float: right\"> <a href=\"#\">info</a> </div> </div> </div> </div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-19T12:22:25.844744", "ruling_date": "2017-02-22T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tammy Baldwin changes views on how quickly to act on a Supreme Court nomination", "ruling_headline_slug": "tammy-baldwin-changes-views-how-quickly-act-suprem", "ruling_link_text": "Then: Move fast.
