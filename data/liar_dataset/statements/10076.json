But the GOP summarized it this way in a <a href=\"http://www.wisgop.org/2014/10/wisgop-unveils-new-radio-ad-susan-happs-shady-land-deal/\">news release</a> tied to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsM89Nf1PcM&amp;list=UUHxa0LjLU3cxnZ3mLWXfWPg\">second ad</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000 from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the claim accurate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background on the case</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The news release refers to the prosecution of Daniel J. Reynolds, who initially faced felony charges filed by Happ&rsquo;s office alleging first-degree and second-degree sexual assaults of a child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, her office signed off on a plea bargain, approved in March 2014 by a judge, that included a deferred prosecution agreement. If Reynolds stays out of trouble and gets the recommended treatment, the charges will be reduced to disorderly conduct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real estate records show Happ and her husband had signed a land contract with Reynolds to sell a piece of property to him for a total of $180,000 over three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody disputes those events, which form the basis for portions of the GOP claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ says she recognized the conflict of interest and took steps in her office to handle it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for backup, the GOP pointed to the timeline of events as evidence of a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; -- something that is given or taken in return for something else, our dictionary says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are big problems with the way the party describes the sequence of events and Happ&rsquo;s knowledge and actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the claim makes it sound like Happ &quot;took&quot; $180,000 from a defendant after he was charged, then recommended light punishment for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a closer look at the sequence:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Records show the monthly payments under the land deal were two months from completion when the Jefferson Police Department asked Happ&rsquo;s office in March 2012 to review its request for charges against Reynolds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there was an ongoing financial relationship at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the land deal was signed more than three years before Reynolds was charged on May 21, 2013, and it ended in May 2012 -- before he was charged, but while the case was being reviewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP portrays the sale as a &quot;shady&quot; deal with a child predator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the criminal complaint that was eventually filed, the assaults occurred between 2001 and 2005. So if the complaint is right, the defendant was a child predator before the land deal in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But records indicate the police investigation began in October 2011. So, Reynolds was not yet charged or under investigation at the time the land deal was initiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And no one has presented evidence that Happ, elected district attorney in 2008, knew that Reynolds was allegedly involved in assaults until the matter came to her office in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $180,000 figure cited by the GOP was owed to both Happ and her husband, according to the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the property in question was owned by Happ&rsquo;s husband before the two were married in March 2009. Reynolds was a tenant in the building at some point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ told us she signed the land contract because it&rsquo;s marital property, but that as a practical matter, she and her husband keep their assets separate and that payments from Reynolds went to her husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, she said, &quot;marital property is marital property,&quot; and she understands the conflict of interest was still there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP also says Happ offered Reynolds a deferred prosecution deal. The deal was made by her office, but court records show that the case was assigned to and handled by one of her assistant DAs, Monica Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ says that, following Supreme Court ethics procedures, she screened herself off from decisions or any involvement in the case when she recognized Reynolds&rsquo; name on the referral from the police department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An official at the state Office of Lawyer Regulation, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/susan-happs-meeting-with-journal-sentinel-to-be-streamed-live-b99370086z1-279028251.html\">citing</a> that screening procedure, said on Oct. 13, 2014 there was no indication of an ethics breach by Happ. The agency received a complaint in September 2014 about Happ&rsquo;s handling of the case from the victim of the assaults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note. The GOP claim suggests Reynolds got off too easy -- a feeling the victim shares, based on her complaint to the Office of Lawyer Regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ said on a radio show that she believes from the general details she knows that the case was handled properly by the assistant DA, whom she described as &quot;tenacious and well qualified.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican Party said, &quot;As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000&quot; in a &quot;shady&quot; land deal &quot;from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The adequacy of Happ&rsquo;s response to a conflict of interest is up for debate, but the GOP stretches and distorts the timeline of events to create a highly misleading attack without evidence to back up the idea that Reynolds got a sweetheart deal by paying $180,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-14T17:38:12.923242", "ruling_date": "2014-10-15T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin GOP says Susan Happ took $180,000 from a defendant she offered deferred prosecution", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-gop-says-susan-happ-took-180000-defendan", "ruling_link_text": "In this case, DA stands for 'Distorted Ad'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Republican Party of Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.wisgop.org/2014/10/wisgop-unveils-new-radio-ad-susan-happs-shady-land-deal/\">press release</a>, Oct. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican Party of Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJsdMRbXza4&amp;index=5&amp;list=UUHxa0LjLU3cxnZ3mLWXfWPg\">first radio ad</a> on Reynolds case, Sept. 30, 2014 ;
