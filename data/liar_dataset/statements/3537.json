This is an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960, when there were 15 million workers in manufacturing and 8.7 million collecting a paycheck from the government. &hellip; We have moved decisively from a nation of makers to a nation of takers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeveral readers asked us to take a look at Moore&rsquo;s column. We&rsquo;ll focus on his contention that the ratio of people working for the government and working in manufacturing today is &quot;an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the historical employment data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here&rsquo;s what we found:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotal government employment, January 1960: 8,307,000<br />\r\n\tTotal government employment, March 2011: 22,166,000<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotal manufacturing employment, January 1960: 15,687,000<br />\r\n\tTotal manufacturing employment, March 2011: 11,667,000<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo us, all of these numbers appear quite close to what Moore wrote. So he&rsquo;s right on the numbers. But is he correct that today&rsquo;s numbers show &quot;an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s less clear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found a somewhat different story if you swap out Moore&rsquo;s raw employment numbers and instead use the numbers for each of the sector&rsquo;s share of total U.S. employment. Doing it this way takes into account the increasing size of the American work force over more than 50 years -- it grew from 54.2 million workers in 1960 to 130.7 million workers in 2011. Here are the percentages:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotal government share of U.S. employment, January 1960: 15 percent<br />\r\n\tTotal government share of U.S. employment, March 2011: 17 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotal manufacturing share of U.S. employment, January 1960: 29 percent<br />\r\n\tTotal manufacturing share of U.S. employment, March 2011: 9 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat this shows is that government&rsquo;s proportion of the work force has increased -- but by a relatively modest rate. Meanwhile, manufacturing -- for countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology -- has fallen off a cliff during the past 50 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo us, the comparison of jobs in government and manufacturing looks less like &quot;an almost exact reversal,&quot; as Moore puts it, than two largely unrelated changes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll add a final point of context. Several other employment sectors grew at faster rates over the 50-year period than government did. The leisure and hospitality sector, for instance, grew from 6.3 percent of the workforce in 1960 to 10 percent in 2011, and professional business services roughly doubled, from 6.8 percent in 1960 to 13.1 percent in 2011. So, other types of private-sector employment -- jobs that don&rsquo;t &quot;make&quot; anything -- took up some of the slack from manufacturing&rsquo;s decline.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does this leave us? Moore&rsquo;s raw employment numbers for manufacturing and government are accurate, but adding context about the size of the labor force as a whole weakens the notion that the trendlines are an &quot;exact reversal.&quot; On balance, we rate the statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-06T13:44:44.747382", "ruling_date": "2011-04-06T14:12:21", "ruling_headline": "Steve Moore says ratio of people working in government, manufacturing is \u201can almost exact reversal\" of pattern in 1960", "ruling_headline_slug": "steve-moore-says-ratio-people-working-government-m", "ruling_link_text": "Manufacturing's share fell a whole lot faster than government's grew", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tStephen Moore, &quot;We&#39;ve Become a Nation of Takers, Not Makers&quot; (<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704050204576219073867182108.html\">Wall Street Journal op-ed</a>), April 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/\">main </a><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/\">page</a> for Current Employment Statistics database, accessed April 4, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with J.D.
