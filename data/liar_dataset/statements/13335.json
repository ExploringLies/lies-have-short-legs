Nearly all of that money has come from the tobacco industry and much of it has been spent on television ads criticizing the initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters have raised nearly $30 million for it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prop 56 would impose a $2 per pack tax increase on cigarettes statewide and fund health programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent No on 56 TV ad features a retired doctor who makes a provocative claim about how the measure&rsquo;s revenue would be spent:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Prop 56 diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don&#39;t have to help even one more patient,&quot; says Amador County Dr. Arnold Zeiderman, who appears in the ad wearing a white coat and stethoscope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would the measure really distribute the bulk of the revenue to &quot;wealthy special interests&quot; with no mandate to serve more patients? We decided to check the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office expects Prop 56 could generate up to $1.4 billion in tax revenue in its first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chunk of that would go to replacing losses to state tobacco funds that would likely see a dip if cigarette sales decline due to the tax increase. Five percent would be spent to administer the tax. And about $120 million would go to various state programs, from law enforcement to physician training to dental disease prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=56&amp;year=2016\">LAO report</a> says 82 percent of the remaining revenue -- anywhere from $700 million to $1 billion -- would be spent to &quot;increase the level of payment for healthcare, services and treatment provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medi-Cal provides health care for the state&rsquo;s poorest residents. Health advocates have long argued the program&rsquo;s reimbursement rates are too low to retain and attract doctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/7799283/tobacco,%20cigarettes.jpeg\" style=\"height:585px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Charles Rex Arbogast /AP file photo</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expanding patient access?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters of Prop 56 say boosting reimbursement rates will lead to more doctors serving more Medi-Cal patients -- which runs against the implication in the ad that the measure won&rsquo;t help &quot;even one more patient.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Graves of the California Budget and Policy Center <a href=\"http://calbudgetcenter.org/blog/proposition-56-california-voters-increase-state-excise-tax-cigarettes-tobacco-products/\">examined Prop 56</a> and concluded on the center&rsquo;s website: &quot;Increasing Medi-Cal reimbursement rates would help to boost providers&rsquo; participation in the program and help ensure timely access to care &mdash; and possibly improved health outcomes &mdash; for the more than 13 million low-income Californians who rely on Medi-Cal to meet their health care needs.&quot; The policy center is a nonprofit that advocates for programs aimed at low-income families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the No on 56 campaign acknowledged that 82 percent of the measure&rsquo;s revenue would be set aside for increasing reimbursement rates. But the No campaign also said the measure does nothing to require more Medi-Cal patients are served.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters say that point is technically correct but distorts the point of the measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We made a determination that it would be better to dedicate money to Medi-Cal broadly rather than setting an arbitrary formula,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.health-access.org/about/health-access-staff/staff-bios.html\">Anthony Wright</a>, executive director of Health Access California, the consumer advocacy group that helped draft Prop 56. &quot;The idea that this would help not even one new patient is sort of absurd. ... They&#39;re playing a little bit of a word game there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Misleading&rsquo; ad</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.uchastings.edu/news/articles/2015/11/welcoming-manoj-viswanathan.php\">Manoj Viswanathan</a>, a UC Hastings law professor who focuses on tax policy and has studied Proposition 56, described the No campaign&rsquo;s advertisement as &quot;misleading.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The professor, who is not affiliated with either side, said the No campaign appears to rest the second portion of the claim by the retired doctor -- the idea that Medi-Cal providers &quot;don&#39;t have to help even one more patient&quot; -- on an &quot;unlikely&quot; scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is there a universe where doctors see the exact same patients that they would have seen anyway, but are just getting paid more? Sure. I think that is a mathematical possibility. It just seems unlikely,&quot; Viswanathan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the LAO, the California State Auditor would conduct audits of agencies receiving funds from the new taxes at least every other year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article103292162.html\">Sacramento Bee examined claims</a> by No on 56, and found questionable its description of Medi-Cal providers as &quot;wealthy special interests.&quot; It notes those providers are &quot;doctors, clinics, hospitals, managed care plans and any other health-related group that get Medi-Cal payments because they provide services to eligible patients.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent No on 56 campaign ad claims: &quot;Prop 56 diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don&#39;t have to help even one more patient.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office reported that 82 percent of revenue generated by the measure, after some is directed to other funds, would be spent to &quot;increase the level of payment for healthcare, services and treatment provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts who have examined Prop 56 say there&rsquo;s a strong chance that higher reimbursement rates will attract more doctors and expand health care access for patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s the smallest sliver of truth to the No on 56 campaign&rsquo;s claim that providers &quot;don&rsquo;t have to help even one more patient&quot; because the measure does not dictate how many new patients will be served.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the claim also asks one to suspend reality by believing no new doctors would be attracted by the higher rates and that current doctors would not add more patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the addition of handful of new doctors would expand healthcare access, shooting down the campaign&rsquo;s misleading statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated its&nbsp;claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;
