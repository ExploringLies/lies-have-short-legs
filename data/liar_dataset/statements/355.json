That is, cards from your favorite Democratic opponents.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put T and AX together,\" coos a sweet valentine from Sen.

Barack Obama.\n</p>\n<p>\n Six options await the last-minute shopper &mdash; and you can send it to 10 people at once!\n</p>\n<p>\n Many can appreciate the messages' snide sentiments, but here's the problem: While most of the Valentines are cute twists on criticisms of the two candidates, one is simply untrue.\n</p>\n<p>\n It's a Clinton valentine that reads: \"Roses are red, violets are blue, I'll raise your taxes and there is nothing you can do.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n PolitiFact checked an earlier claim from the RNC that Clinton's campaign proposals would cost taxpayers more than $777.6-billion. We found that to be\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/196/\">\n  Mostly True.\n </a>\n And Clinton has said she supports letting the Bush tax cuts of 2001 expire as scheduled in 2010 for people making more than $250,000 a year. Critics point to that as a sign she plans to raise taxes as president.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it's the \"there is nothing you can do\" line that draws the Truth-O-Meter's attention.\n</p>\n<p>\n Since when can a president raise taxes without the approval of Congress? And aren't voters encouraged to speak up about policies they oppose?\n</p>\n<p>\n We gave a Pants on Fire ruling to former presidential candidate John Edwards when he claimed\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/190/\">\n  king-like powers\n </a>\n for the presidency. The RNC now makes a similar claim.\n</p>\n<p>\n Maybe the RNC should stick to the biting sarcasm of such sentiments as \"On this Valentine's Day ... may higher taxes come your way!\" (a Clinton card offering) or \"Will you be my Valentine? Yes ... no ... present\" (a shot at Obama's voting record in the Illinois state Senate).\n</p>\n<p>\n Or consider adding fact sheets with footnotes to its Valentines.
