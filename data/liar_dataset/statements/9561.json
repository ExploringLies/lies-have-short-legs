In fact, it&rsquo;s quite the opposite. The agency received zero complaints about the team&rsquo;s name.

As expected, the team is appealing the decision, just as it did when it challenged the same panel&rsquo;s decision in 1999 in a related complaint and won. (The football team can keep the rights to its trademark as it goes through the appeals process.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two weeks after the decision, the <em>Washington Times</em> ran <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/1/redskins-name-drew-no-public-complaints-patent-off/#ixzz36oiqe3Sm%20\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a story</u></a> about how the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could not produce any records that showed members of the public wrote in to express their opinions about the team&rsquo;s name before the most recent ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newspaper&rsquo;s public records request for correspondence about the logo turned up 13 pages of records, half of which came from a Texas man who wrote a &quot;meandering&quot; letter by hand after the ruling. The other pages came from a person congratulating the appeals board and from staffers seeking background information about the case for Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting member of Congress from Washington, D.C. (and an opponent of the team&rsquo;s name).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it the &quot;bombshell&quot; as described by the Conservative Tribune website? Not really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not solicit public comment like other government agencies as they consider new rules and regulations. It&rsquo;s not built that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its process prescribed by the U.S. Code works similar to a legal trial, in which only the parties involved can submit evidence. There could be one letter or 1,000, but it&rsquo;s not going to make a difference in whether a trademark is granted or canceled. Put another way, it&rsquo;s not part of the process in the way that the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/napr.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Environmental Protection Agency</u></a> or <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Federal Trade Commission</u></a> reviews public input before considering a new rule or regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office acts more like the Supreme Court, in that the court wouldn&rsquo;t solicit or consider your opinion of the health care law before it issued a ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The presence or absence of letters of complaint in a case like this really does not have any bearing on whether or not a trademark is going to be canceled,&quot; said Elizabeth Rowe,&nbsp;University of Florida College of Law professor and director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law. &quot;If you want a trademark to be canceled, you have to do what the plaintiffs did here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Redskins case deals with existing trademark registrations, which require investment on the part of people who seek to have the trademark canceled under federal code. In this case, five young people with American Indian heritage petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office in 2006 to cancel the registrations, arguing that it is disparaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a brief period to allow for opposition to pending trademark applications, but a simple letter of complaint would not do much there either, Rowe said. That window is usually used by rival companies to assert whether a logo is too close to their own and confusing for consumers, and objections involve filing an objection, evidence to support it and having a hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s really neither here nor there to say that they were letters of complaint or how many were there,&quot; Rowe said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Washington Times</em> article that called the missing public comment into question even echoes these points, quoting the plaintiffs&rsquo; attorney and a Georgetown University professor as saying public correspondence isn&rsquo;t built into the process for hearing individual cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For what it&#39;s worth, there are <a href=\"http://www.thepetitionsite.com/306/702/557/undo-the-racial-slur-change-the-redskins-name/\">petitions</a>&nbsp;at websites like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/washington-redskins-ask-daniel-snyder-to-change-the-name\">Change.org</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/keep-the-washington-redskins\">MoveOn.org</a>&nbsp;in favor of changing the name or ditching it, and some have thousands of signatures. But the&nbsp;aim is to rally people about the issue and exert pressure on team ownership, not to influence the decisions of administrative law judges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservative blog posts smell a scandal in the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark, pointing out that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office &quot;received zero complaints&quot; about it before an administrative law court ruled in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case was opened because someone complained -- so that assertion is wrong on its face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even that aside, the post is misleading in suggesting that public comments are part of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office process when they are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When people have a problem with patents and trademarks and want them removed, they file formal complaints, prove their standing in the case, pay a fee, and provide evidence to support their case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, they do exactly what the five plaintiffs in this case did here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-08T15:38:18.955544", "ruling_date": "2014-07-09T11:06:28", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received zero complaints about Washington Redskins, bloggers say", "ruling_headline_slug": "us-patent-and-trademark-office-received-zero-compl", "ruling_link_text": "Except for the complaint that started this case", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Conservative Tribune, <a href=\"http://conservativetribune.com/zero-redskins-complaints/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;BOMBSHELL: Patent Office Received ZERO Complaints About Redskins Name</u></a>,&quot; July 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Washington Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/1/redskins-name-drew-no-public-complaints-patent-off/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Patent Office didn&rsquo;t receive a single complaint before stripping Redskins trademark</u></a>,&quot; July 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Patrick Ross, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office spokesman, July 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Elizabeth Rowe, University of Florida College of Law professor of intellectual property law, July 7, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "", "false_count": 82, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 280, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 416, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office &quot;received zero complaints&quot; about the Washington Redskins name.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "blog posts", "statement_date": "2014-07-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 216, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/216/", "subject": "Sports", "subject_slug": "sports", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
