Doesn&rsquo;t hurt to point out how many times you&rsquo;ve sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaigning for attorney general, Railroad Commission head Barry Smitherman uploaded a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cez2ZwYMlWU\"><u>video</u></a> to YouTube on Aug. 5, 2013, in which he said that he&rsquo;d &quot;sued Obama&rsquo;s EPA seven times to protect Texas jobs and energy for our families.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Texas examined a related statement May 10, 2013, from the man holding the job Smitherman wants. State Attorney General Greg Abbott said he&rsquo;d sued President Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration 25 times, a claim we rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/may/10/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-he-has-sued-obama-administration-/\"><u>True</u></a>. Now running for governor, Abbott is <a href=\"http://www.gregabbott.com/the-epa-challenges-texans-freedom/\"><u>highlighting</u></a> his suits against the EPA (he&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5TDhTb1VpdU5OOE0/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>up to 19</u></a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many lawsuits, Abbott acts at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us for that story, &quot;We file them on behalf of state agencies. We&rsquo;re the lawyer, they&rsquo;re the client.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That client capacity, Smitherman told us by phone, was the role he took in seven lawsuits spanning his time at the state Public Utilities Commission (2004-2011, became chairman in 2007), and Railroad Commission (2011-present, became chairman in 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suits deal with greenhouse gases, cross-state air pollution and specific airborne toxins such as mercury. &quot;What we have seen with all of these,&quot; Smitherman said, &quot;is this EPA initiating rule-making that in my opinion is not backed up by law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His spokesman, Allen Blakemore, emailed us a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5RVl4WkoxMWhrNjQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>list and descriptions</u></a> of the seven lawsuits that he said Smitherman had, either individually or on behalf of the commissions, referred to the attorney general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What action is involved in such a referral &quot;depends upon the case,&quot; Blakemore said. For example, in the two lawsuits that involved Smitherman&rsquo;s role on the Railroad Commission, he said, &quot;the commission voted to request representation by&quot; Abbott. &quot;A letter was then written to the AG requesting that action be taken against EPA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the top of one such <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/forms/letters/Abbot_EPACrossstatepollutionletter_102311.pdf\"><u>letter</u></a>, signed by Railroad Commission chairwoman Elizabeth Ames Jones and by railroad commissioners Smitherman and David Porter, dated Aug. 23, 2011:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VVdmDUShr7-1JSn8mDqJno70d6QrDVEPaJZL-48Xva3Fz66xoLC2p5_BkUF8l_8-uzfKAxTh5NYQKYoAZDdlS5U8sbaueBQjvkzZZIAdHWKBfl-SSwJdpF26hQ\" style=\"height:138px; width:587px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LOmCMjsBTZAZjmKJZBBXxHG0z2zAdvEbZRi3t5N_Wi0/edit\"><u>looked up</u></a> the lawsuits on <a href=\"http://www.pacer.gov/\"><u>PACER</u></a>, a federal service providing public access to records from U.S. district, bankruptcy and appellate courts. All originated after Obama&rsquo;s first inauguration Jan. 20, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smitherman is personally named as a plaintiff in three cases in his capacity as head of the PUC. The other four cases list only the agencies&rsquo; names as plaintiffs, but going by their filing dates, Smitherman was PUC chairman when two were filed, a member of the Railroad Commission when one was filed and chairman of the Railroad Commission in the most recent case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five lawsuits involving the <a href=\"http://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/about/mission.aspx\"><u>PUC</u></a>, Texas&rsquo; regulator of electrical and telecommunication utilities, challenged EPA restrictions on greenhouse gases that Blakemore said &quot;threatened the ability of electric utilities to receive permits, modifications or build new facilities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two suits involving the Railroad Commission, Texas&rsquo; regulator of oil and gas, addressed a cross-state air pollution rule and a restriction on airborne mercury and other toxins that, Blakemore said, adversely affected mining for lignite used in electricity generation. (<a href=\"http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mdr01\"><u>Created</u></a> in 1891 to oversee, well, railroads, the commission ooched into <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/about/faqs/rrcjurisdictions.php\"><u>energy</u></a> after getting jurisdiction in 1917 over pipelines transporting oil and gas.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked University of Texas Law School professor Charles Silver, whose specialties include the procedures and practices used in civil lawsuits, if it&rsquo;s reasonable to say Smitherman &quot;sued&quot; the EPA in these cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Seems fair to me,&quot; Silver told us via email. &quot;In ordinary conversations, people don&rsquo;t make the sort of technical distinctions you identify&quot; -- such as being specifically named as a plaintiff vs. the commission being named -- &quot;even though they&rsquo;re accurate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smitherman said he &quot;sued Obama&rsquo;s EPA seven times.&quot; In the seven EPA lawsuits -- all during the Obama administration -- that his spokesman identified, either Smitherman or the commission he served on at the time is named as a plaintiff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement as True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash;
