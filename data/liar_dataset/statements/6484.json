This is just the kind of data NASCAR might publicize to coax it to stay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it correct?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe threat of losing the Guard is real. U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., regularly introduces attempts to stop all military sports sponsorships, not just NASCAR.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis year, she gained the support of Republican U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah, a budget hawk. They failed, but with federal budget cuts on the horizon, sponsorships remain at risk.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe reached out to NASCAR, academics, private research companies, McCollum and Kingston.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKingston&rsquo;s office did not respond. An official from McCollum&rsquo;s office criticized Phelps&rsquo; claim but gave no specific data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNASCAR sent us proprietary information from Experian Consumer Research, a private data company. The findings came from a survey of about 25,000 U.S. adults, including nonfans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperian found that 18 percent of NASCAR fans serve or have served in the armed forces or reserves, compared with 9 percent of nonfans. In other words, fans were twice as likely to serve or be veterans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is close to what Phelps said. He said fans were twice as likely &quot;to serve&quot; in the military.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperian also reported that about 37 percent of current or past military members were fans, just as Phelps said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are shortcomings in Experian&rsquo;s data. The definition of &quot;fan&quot; was broad. It includes respondents who said they were &quot;very,&quot; &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;a little bit&quot; interested in NASCAR.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, the findings are not the result of a peer-reviewed study published in an academic journal -- the gold standard of research. NASCAR paid for the data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese factors do not discredit the poll, but we&rsquo;d have more confidence in its findings if other surveys had similar results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConfirmation was hard to find. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In general, there is a bizarrely scant amount of NASCAR research among sport fandom scholars,&quot; said John Spinda, an assistant professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. He has published research on NASCAR.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Spinda and others agreed that NASCAR&rsquo;s military data made sense in light of other research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;NASCAR fans are more likely to be male and less likely to be college-educated, so it makes sense that fans would be more likely to be involved in the military,&quot; said Larry DeGaris, director of the Academic Sports Marketing Program at the University of Indianapolis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeGaris is also president of the company Sponsorship Research &amp; Strategy, which researches corporate sponsorship. A &nbsp;2006 poll of more than 1,000 respondents found that 56 percent of those who described themselves as fans were male.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe private firm Scarborough Research asked 200,000 people whether they had &quot;any interest in NASCAR&quot; in its survey from August 2010 through September 2011. Fans were 31 percent more likely to be male than U.S. adults in general, and 13 percent were less likely to have graduated from college.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJames Dertouzos has studied military sponsorships as senior economist at the nonprofit RAND Corp. He said NASCAR&rsquo;s audience is also more likely to be blue-collar, middle-class, Southern or Midwestern, and politically conservative<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;These are exactly the people who have positive impressions of service in the military,&quot; Dertouzos said. RAND is an independent research institute with roots in the U.S. military and defense industries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tData support his statement. Scarborough reported fans were 19 percent more likely to be blue-collar workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat company&rsquo;s 2009 data, posted on NASCAR&rsquo;s website, also agree with Dertouzos&rsquo; assessment that fans are more likely to be Midwestern and Southern, although Sponsorship Research &amp; Strategy found they were more evenly distributed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeGaris&rsquo; group found fans were more likely to be Republican. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that Scarborough found that fans were 18 percent more likely to have &quot;military specific&quot; jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis appears to support Phelps&rsquo; claim, but researchers surveyed few people in this category. These findings are not as reliable as their other data, a spokeswoman told us. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur conclusion:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat little data that exists appears to support Phelps&rsquo; points that NASCAR fans are more likely to serve, and that service members and veterans are more likely to be fans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhelps appears to give a correct impression, although supporting data are thin. We give him a Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-16T16:49:11.193094", "ruling_date": "2012-08-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "NASCAR executive says many fans serve in military", "ruling_headline_slug": "nascar-executive-says-many-fans-serve-military", "ruling_link_text": "Data is thin, but claim makes sense", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/army/236949-army-drops-nascar-sponsorship\">Army drops 10-year NASCAR sponsorship</a>,&quot; July 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitico.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78346.html\">Army drops NASCAR sponsorship</a>,&quot; July 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStewart-Haas Racing, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.stewarthaasracing.com/media/index.php?article=920\">2013 Sponsorship News from SHR</a>,&quot; July 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNASCAR, data from Experian Consumer Research, &quot;Serving in the Armed Forces / Military Reserves,&quot; emailed Aug. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRAND Corp., &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA495555\">The Cost-Effectiveness of Military Advertising: Evidence from 2002-2004</a>,&quot; 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSponsorship Research &amp; Strategy, &quot;50 million NASCAR fans skew male, blue collar, and politically right,&quot; 2006<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJournal of Popular Culture, &quot;If It Ain&rsquo;t Rubbin&rsquo;, It Ain&rsquo;t Racin&rsquo;: NASCAR, American Values, and Fandom,&quot; 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperian Consumer Research, Simmons National Consumer Study, accessed Aug. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScarborough Research, 2011 NASCAR data, received Aug. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Jon Schwartz, spokesman, NASCAR, Aug. 7 and 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Larry DeGaris, director, Academic Sports Marketing Program, University of Indianapolis, Aug. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, John Spinda, assistant professor, Murray State University, Aug. 10 and 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, James N.
