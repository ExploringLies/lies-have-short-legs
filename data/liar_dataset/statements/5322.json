The source for Romney&rsquo;s and the others&rsquo; statements is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called <a href=\"http://otrans.3cdn.net/ee40602f9a7d8172b8_ozm6bt5oi.pdf\">&quot;The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan&quot;</a> from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president&#39;s top economic adviser.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tTheir report projected that the stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn&rsquo;t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,&quot; the report states. &quot;There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: &quot;Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney didn&#39;t use the word &quot;promise&quot; as Boehner, Cantor and others did when we checked the same claim previously, but the meaning is the same, that Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had &quot;significant margins of error&quot; and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is &quot;unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.&quot; In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not &nbsp;a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce again, we rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-08T15:11:21.564701", "ruling_date": "2012-02-08T15:33:27", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney says president promised peak of 8 percent unemployment", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-says-president-promised-peak-8-percent", "ruling_link_text": "Projection, not a promise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tC-SPAN.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/Events/Mitt-Romney-Wins-Nevada-Caucuses/10737427969/\">Mitt Romney Wins Nevada Caucuses</a>,&quot; Feb. 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/13/george-will/will-obama-said-stimulus-would-cap-unemployment-8-/\">Will: Obama said stimulus would cap unemployment at 8 percent</a>,&quot; July 13, 2010<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/09/eric-cantor/Cantor-and-other-republicans-say-obama-promised-s/\">Cantor and other Republicans say Obama promised stimulus would keep unemployment rates below 8 percent</a>,&quot; July 9, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-says-white-house-promised-sti/\">Rep.
