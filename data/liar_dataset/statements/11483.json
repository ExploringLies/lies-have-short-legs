Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble. Do you believe this? We drive over a bridge, it&rsquo;s in trouble.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether the eye-popping 61 percent figure is true. Trump&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our request for the source of the statistic, so we did some digging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Highway Administration publishes <a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/deficient.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>annual data</u></a> on deficient bridges in state and federal highway systems. The most recent report, based on December 2014 findings, found that 61,365 bridges are &quot;structurally deficient.&quot; That breaks down to about 10 percent of the nation&rsquo;s 610,749 bridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FHWA<a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/2010cpr/execsum.cfm#c2h\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> website</u></a> says &quot;a `structurally deficient&rsquo; designation does not imply that a bridge is unsafe, but such bridges typically require significant maintenance and repair to remain in service, and would eventually require major rehabilitation or replacement to address the underlying deficiency.&quot; These often are rural bridges, according to the agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FHWA lists another 84,525 bridges -- or almost 14 percent -- as &quot;functionally obsolete.&quot; These are mostly urban spans that the agency <a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/2010cpr/execsum.cfm#c2h\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>says</u></a> don&rsquo;t &quot;meet current design standards (for criteria such as lane width), either because the volume of traffic carried by the bridge exceeds the level anticipated when the bridge was constructed and/or the relevant design standards have been revised.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, 145,890 U.S. bridges have been identified as deficient. That comes to 24 percent of the nation&rsquo;s spans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that the Henrico rally wasn&rsquo;t the first time Trump has used the bridge statistic. During an Aug. 25 news conference in Iowa, he said &quot;59 percent of our bridges are in trouble.&quot; FactCheck.org published an article two days later saying the claim was inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;re wondering, <a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/deficient.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Virginia</u></a> has 13,800 bridges and the highway administration characterizes 3,574 of them as deficient. That&rsquo;s 26 percent. Of those spans, 1,120 -- or 8 percent -- are structurally deficient. Another 2,454 bridges -- or 18 percent -- are functionally obsolete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump says &quot;61 percent of our bridges are in trouble.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FHWA identifies 24 percent of the bridges as deficient. This doesn&rsquo;t mean, to borrow a Trump phrase, that &quot;our bridges are falling down.&quot; It means that the infrastructure is aging and many of the spans require high maintenance, while others are serving more traffic than anticipated when they were built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t mean to minimize the nation&rsquo;s infrastructure problems, but Trump&rsquo;s inflated figure is nowhere near the mark. We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-25T14:52:44.344381", "ruling_date": "2015-10-26T11:40:00", "ruling_headline": "Trump says 61 percent of U.S. bridges 'in trouble'", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-says-61-percent-us-bridges-trouble", "ruling_link_text": "Not even close", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>C-SPAN,<a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?328732-1/donald-trump-campaign-rally-richmond-virginia\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Donald Trump speech in Henrico County, Va.</u></a>, Oct. 14, 2015.
