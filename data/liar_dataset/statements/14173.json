about the 1 percenters in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tax Foundation expressed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/comments-who-pays-distributional-analysis-tax-systems-all-50-states-second-edition/\">criticism at the time</a> and Walczak emphasized to us that the study omits some taxes altogether -- such as business license taxes, gross receipts taxes and severance taxes. And the study includes one federal provision -- the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes paid -- to make state tax systems &quot;look more regressive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, data for the omitted taxes were not available, the institute told us. And even if the federal deduction were not considered, the richest 1 percent in Wisconsin would <a href=\"https://itep.org/whopays/wisconsin/\">still have a lower</a> state and local tax burden than other income groups in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.urban.org/author/richard-c-auxier\">Richard Auxier</a>, state and local tax policy expert at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center, noted state and local taxes in the vast majority of states, including Wisconsin, are regressive: They rely largely on sales and property taxes, which generally take a bigger bite out of the incomes of lower income people than higher income people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also said that although Wisconsin&rsquo;s income tax is relatively progressive, its earned income tax credit, which eases the income tax burden on lower-income residents, isn&rsquo;t overly generous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, given the generally regressive nature of taxes states rely upon, McCabe&rsquo;s statement is not surprising. Indeed, if he made the statement about 48 of the 50 states (except Alaska and California, plus the District of Columbia), it would be on target, according to the report he cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCabe says: &quot;When you look at all the state and local taxes we pay in Wisconsin, the wealthiest 1 percent pay the lowest overall tax rate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His claim is based on a 2015 report which found that the top 1 percent of earners (income of $399,000 and above) pay 6.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes -- a lighter burden than six lower income groups. It&rsquo;s important to note that the report&rsquo;s methodology has its critics, but it is the latest available study that attempts to assess state and local tax burdens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that caveat, we rate the statement Mostly True.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More fact checks on the richest</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mark Pocan:</strong> Under &quot;Trumpcare,&quot; the Republican replacement for Obamacare, &quot;$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/21/mark-pocan/americas-wealthiest-get-600-billion-tax-breaks-rep/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jennifer Shilling: </strong>Under Donald Trump&#39;s tax plan, &quot;the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- &nbsp;would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/20/jennifer-shilling/top-01-would-be-big-winner-under-donald-trumps-tax/\">True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders:</strong> &quot;The top one-tenth of 1 percent&quot; of Americans &quot;own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-madison-claims-top-01-americans-hav/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jeb Bush:</strong> &quot;The top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/oct/26/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-top-1-percent-pay-nearly-half-all-ta/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-31T18:28:10.476552", "ruling_date": "2017-06-02T10:20:19", "ruling_headline": "Richest 1 percent pay lowest rate of state and local taxes in Wisconsin?", "ruling_headline_slug": "richest-1-percent-pay-lowest-rate-state-and-local", "ruling_link_text": "One study says so, though methodology has critics", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WKOW-TV, &quot;Capital City Sunday&quot; <a href=\"http://www.wkow.com/story/35487090/2017/05/22/mike-mccabe-discusses-potential-run-for-governor-on-capital-city-sunday\">interview</a> (11:20) of Mike McCabe, May 21, 2017 (posted May 22, 2017)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Mike McCabe, May 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy senior policy analyst Lisa Christensen Gee, June 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Budget Project, <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/wisconsins-tax-system-exacerbates-growing-gap-between-rich-and-everyone-else-2\">&quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s Tax System Exacerbates Growing Gap between Rich and Everyone Else,&quot;</a> April 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Budget Project, <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/budget-toolkit/revenue#whopays\">&quot;Wisconsin Taxes: Who Pays?&quot;</a> accessed May 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Institute on Taxation &amp; Economic Policy, <a href=\"https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/whopaysreport.pdf\">&quot;Who Pays?
