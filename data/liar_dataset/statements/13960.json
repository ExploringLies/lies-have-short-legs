Eric Greitens to fulfill one of his campaign promises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Feb. 6, Greitens signed a law making Missouri the 28th right-to-work state, part of his strategy to improve the state&rsquo;s economic climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, in a Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto, the Republican governor touted the effects of the legislation, saying Missouri has joined the ranks of states that have seen a considerable amount of job growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greitens said in the interview: &quot;Over the past 25 years, job growth in right-to-work states has been twice as high as in non-right-to-work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right-to-work laws prohibit union security agreements, which limit a union&rsquo;s ability to require employees to join. These contracts can include mandatory fees as a condition of employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greitens signed the bill into law on Feb. 6. The law will take effect Aug. 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opponents of Missouri&rsquo;s right-to-work law say it will allow workers declining to pay union fees to reap the benefits of unions, which are required by federal law to protect all workers covered by a contract. Supporters say it will encourage employers to move to the state, thereby creating more jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered how Greitens arrived at the statistic that job growth has been growing at a much faster rate in right-to-work states and, furthermore, if there was truly a relationship between job growth and right-to-work laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The numbers are more complicated</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parker Briden, a spokesman for the Missouri governor&rsquo;s office, directed us to a 2015 article from the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative, nonprofit think tank in Chicago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article&rsquo;s author, Michael Lucci, reported that the job growth in right-to-work states from 1990-2015 was 47 percent, while job growth in non-right-to-work states was 21 percent during the same time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Lucci calculated the percent change for nonfarm job growth in each state over the time period and placed them into two groups &mdash; one right-to-work, the other non-right-to-work. Lucci did not adjust the job numbers for population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aggregating job growth totals from right-to-work and non-right-to-work states is not as accurate as comparing growth in individual states, according to Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon and a former senior labor policy adviser for the U.S. House of Representatives&#39; Committee on Education and Labor.&nbsp; Lafer has written in opposition of <a href=\"https://www.afsc.org/sites/afsc.civicactions.net/files/documents/Gordon%20Lafer%20Briefing%20Paper%20on%20RTW%202011.pdf\">right-to-work laws</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lafer said the numbers are being driven by a few high job-growth states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would fail a freshman in college for turning that in,&quot; he said. &quot;If Bill Gates walks into a bar, everyone there is a millionaire based on the average.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An analysis of the data adjusted for population showed that of the eight states that saw more than 10 percent job growth from 1990 to 2015, six had right-to-work laws. On the other hand, a majority of the states that had a decrease in job growth were right-to-work states &mdash; nine out of 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, a comparison of the unemployment rate between the two groups of states suggests that there has been a smaller percentage of unemployed people in non-right-to-work states over the past few decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 10 states that had an increase of more than 10 percent in unemployment since 1990, half of those were right-to-work states. Four of the five states with the largest increases in unemployment were right-to-work states &mdash; Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of these numbers actually prove anything about the policy. Every state is governed by so many different factors affecting their economies that it&rsquo;s difficult to pinpoint one policy as the economic driver using only Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re supposed to say, all other things being equal, what is the effect of this policy?&quot; Lafer said. &quot;Can you prove it&rsquo;s right-to-work that&rsquo;s causing it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Controlling for other factors, two case studies by researchers from the University of Nevada and Claremont McKenna College found mixed results on the economic effects of right-to-work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a paper published in 2011, the authors wrote that Oklahoma&rsquo;s right-to-work laws decreased private-sector union membership in the state but had no effect on job growth, per capita income and wages. Their case study on Idaho&rsquo;s right-to-work laws found an increase in manufacturing jobs, but they had no effect on per capita income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does affect job growth?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What economists know for sure is that two main factors drive job growth &mdash; tax rates and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lafer said a policy like right-to-work might have been a larger incentive for companies in the 1940s and &rsquo;50s, but today the number of people in unions is so low that it doesn&rsquo;t create the incentive it once did. He said companies today are more interested in moving to states with highly educated workforces, especially states with a large number of workers in STEM-related fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, 9.7 percent of Missourians were union members, lower than the U.S. average of 10.7 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rik Hafer, a professor of economics in the Plaster School of Business &amp; Entrepreneurship at Lindenwood University, said that it&rsquo;s important to take many factors into consideration when thinking about whether a policy like right-to-work is actually linked to a state&rsquo;s job growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Factors like tourism, geography and culture can play a role in a company&rsquo;s decision to move to a certain state. But more importantly, Hafer said, job growth is driven by an educated workforce and the individual and corporate taxes the company would face should it decide to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A policy such as right-to-work might not be the make or break deal for Missouri jobs, but Hafer said it could &quot;increase the chances of gaining new jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right-to-work might play a more important role for cities that span the borders of two states, Hafer said. If a business could move just a few miles over to be in a state with a right-to-work law, it might choose to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greitens said: &quot;Over the past 25 years, job growth in right to work states has been twice as high as in non-right to work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His information comes from a conservative think tank that had accurate numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics but used them in a way that experts say is unreliable for measuring the effect of a state law on its economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greitens used correct numbers but excluded important contextual information that might give someone a different impression of the figures. We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Correction:&nbsp;</em><em>This story was corrected on&nbsp;April 6, 2017, to accurately describe the methodology used in the Illinois Policy Institute&rsquo;s analysis of job growth in right-to-work and non-right-to-work states.
