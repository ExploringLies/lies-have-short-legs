Here, we will examine the claim that \"$15 million (in stimulus) dollars  went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska,  population 165.\"<br /><br />This project landed in the national spotlight when it was singled out in a <em>CBS Evening News</em> report on July 13, 2009. \"That's roughly $90,000 dollars per resident,\" the report said.<br /><br />\"Consider that Los Angeles International doesn't have the money to install critical taxiway warning lights,\" the CBS report states. \"And a third of the nation's largest airports -- 11 of the 30 biggest, handling over one-fourth of the nation's passenger traffic -- have substandard safety areas for when planes veer off the runway.\"<br /><br />A lengthier story three days later in the <em>Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror</em> included some defense of the project. To put the project in perspective, some locals said, you have to understand Ouzinkie, and the importance of air travel. Ouzinkie is a small, island village peopled predominantly by Native Alaskans called Alutiiq.<br /><br />Or as ProPublica.org put it in an article titled <em>Tiny Airports Take Off With Stimulus</em>: \"The village of Ouzinkie is one of the remotest outposts in the United States &mdash; home to a mere 165 people on an island off another island off the coast of Alaska. There are no stores, no gas stations and no stoplights.\"<br /><br />Because of its remoteness, villagers depend on its airport as a lifeline for mail, medical evacuations and supplies. The location of the existing airport, local officials told the <em>Kodiak Daily Mirror</em>, is exposed to fierce crosswinds that often make it impossible for planes to take off and land, and the site does not meet FAA-mandated runway length. The new project includes a runway, taxiway, airport lights, a snow removal equipment building and 2 miles of access road. <br /><br />\"I&rsquo;m sorry the airport has to cost so much, but essential services are essential air services,\" Ouzinkie Vice Mayor Tom Quick told the<em> Kodiak Daily Mirror</em>. \"They are essential, whether you&rsquo;re talking about five people or 5,000.\"<br /><br />Quick also said planes  have been much more convenient in transporting the dead, who otherwise were  transported via skiff. <br /><br />\"I feel this is very necessary in case somebody needs to get a medevac out,\" added Jill Boskofsky, vice president of the Ouzinkie Tribal Council and environmental director. \"I feel it's for the safety of our community.\"<br /><br />In an opinion piece for the <em>Anchorage Press</em>, Krestia DeGeorge called the CBS report \"sensationalizing\" and told people to \"quit picking on Ouzinkie.\" <br /><br />Airports in Alaska are a more important part of the basic transportation system than they are elsewhere, she wrote, and, \"The point is that we should think carefully about what&rsquo;s really involved before criticizing something. ... Otherwise (things) such as Ouzinkie&rsquo;s lifeline will continue to be someone else&rsquo;s taxpayer waste.\"</p>\r\n<p>On this one, Boehner has his facts straight. It's worth noting that the one-sentence synopsis of the project leaves out important contextual information, such as how important a lifeline an airport is to this small island community. But Boehner is right. And so we rule his statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-19T17:33:29.121528", "ruling_date": "2010-02-19T17:36:57", "ruling_headline": "Boehner claims $15 million from stimulus going to an Alaskan airport that serves a village of 165", "ruling_headline_slug": "boehner-claims-15-million-stimulus-going-alaskan-a", "ruling_link_text": "Airport is the island's lifeline", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Web site of House Republican Leader John Boehner, <a href=\"http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=170154\" target=\"_blank\">\"As Dems&rsquo; 'Stimulus' Anniversary Nears, Americans Ask: 'Where are the Jobs?'\" </a>Feb. 12, 2010</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Recovery.gov</a>, the U.S. government&rsquo;s official website providing easy access to data related to Recovery Act spending</p>\r\n<p>CBS Evening News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/13/eveningnews/main5156598.shtml?tag=contentBody;featuredPost-PE\" target=\"_blank\">\"Tiny Airports Get Big Cut of Stimulus Cash,\"</a> by Sharyl Attkissson, July 13, 2009</p>\r\n<p>ProPublica.org, <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/feature/tiny-airports-take-off-with-stimulus-713\" target=\"_blank\">\"Tiny Airports Take Off With Stimulus,\"</a> by Michael Grabell, July 13, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Kodiak Daily Mirror, <a href=\"http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com/?pid=19&amp;id=7774\" target=\"_blank\">\"Ouzinkie airport creates national buzz,\" </a>by Bradley Zint, July 16, 2009</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "Speaker of the House of Representatives", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 49, "last_name": "Boehner", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-boehner", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnboehner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/49/", "total_count": 69, "true_count": 17, "website": "http://www.speaker.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>In the stimulus, \"$15 million dollars  went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska,  population 165.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a press release", "statement_date": "2010-02-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 150, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/150/", "subject": "Stimulus", "subject_slug": "stimulus", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
