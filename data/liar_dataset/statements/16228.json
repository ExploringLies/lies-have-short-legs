Bill Nelson and Stacey Abrams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even those losses are far from set in stone. We&#39;ll explain.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Recounts and runoffs</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Florida, a state known for razor-thin election margins, several recounts are underway including for Gillum and&nbsp;Nelson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On election night, Gillum was trailing Republican Ron DeSantis in the race for governor by 77,377 votes when he called DeSantis to congratulate him. But the votes were still being counted. Similarly, Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, was trailing Republican Gov. Rick Scott by a small margin when Scott declared victory just after midnight. Again, the votes were still being counted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Friday, Nov. 10, with unofficial election results finally in from every Florida county, the Democratic candidates in both races were behind by very small counts: DeSantis was leading Gillum by 0.41 percent, or 33,684 votes; and Scott was leading Nelson in the Senate race by 0.15 percent, or 12,562 votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s when Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/11/10/state-orders-machine-recounts-for-governor-u-s-senate-4-other-races/\">ordered a statewide machine recount</a> of over 8.2 million ballots in races for three races, including U.S. Senate and governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida law requires an automatic machine recount in any race where the margin of victory is within one half of one percentage point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Georgia, it&rsquo;s not quite as close, but Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is not conceding. Republican challenger Brian Kemp, who had been the Georgia&rsquo;s Secretary of State for eight years leading up through last week&rsquo;s election, resigned his position overseeing the state&rsquo;s elections on Nov. 8, two days after Election Day, when it became clear his margin of victory could be small enough as to force a runoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Monday night, unofficial returns showed that&nbsp;Kemp&nbsp;was leading by about 58,000 votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But questions about the state&rsquo;s handling of provisional ballots and voter registration system led a federal judge to order a delay in certifying the results until officials conduct a formal review of those issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A Facebook post claims that every candidate Obama hit the campaign trail for lost in Tuesday&rsquo;s election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s just plain wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama did rally for Democratic candidates who ended up losing, but the same goes for several others he supported who won their races.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-14T10:10:43.340554", "ruling_date": "2018-11-14T10:48:06", "ruling_headline": "No, Obama's endorsements were not the kiss of death", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-obamas-endorsements-were-not-kiss-death", "ruling_link_text": "There were winners, losers and some still in question", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2210411919227373&amp;set=a.1931722260429675&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">post</a>, Nov. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653362466/obama-endorses-more-democratic-midterm-candidates-from-congress-to-state-houses\">Obama Endorses More Democratic Midterm Candidates &mdash; From Congress To State Houses</a>,&quot; Oct. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Examiner, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/obama-loses-again\">Obama loses again</a>,&quot; Nov. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tampa Bay Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/11/08/gillum-desantis-race-now-in-recount-range/\">Gillum-DeSantis race now in recount range</a>,&quot; Nov. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tampa Bay Times, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/11/08/how-bill-nelson-could-ultimately-win-the-recount-in-floridas-senate-race/\">How Bill Nelson could ultimately win the recount in Florida&rsquo;s Senate race</a>,&quot; Nov. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-dashboard-live.html\">2018 Midterm Election Results: Live</a>,&quot; Nov. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA Today, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/23/barack-obama-rally-donald-trump-jacky-rosen-dean-heller/1736800002/\">Barack Obama seems to denounce President Trump: &#39;Unlike some, I actually try to state facts,&#39;</a> accessed Nov. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vox, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/7/18053746/senate-midterm-election-results-nevada-jacky-rosen-winner\">Democrat Jacky Rosen beats endangered Republican Sen.
