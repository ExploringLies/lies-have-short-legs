Milwaukee County and Dane County include gender identity in housing and employment discrimination ordinances; and Appleton includes gender identity in its fair housing ordinance.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. </strong>That means that -- unlike gay men, for example, who have a right to file a complaint alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation -- it&rsquo;s unknown whether a Wisconsin state court would accept complaints from transgender people alleging discrimination based on their transgender status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Instead, a transgender person would have to persuade a judge that transgender people are covered either by state laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex or on sexual orientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.</strong> To date, there has not been a published decision by a state judge in Wisconsin stating that transgender people are covered by those anti-discrimination laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rae said Wisconsin&#39;s non-discrimination law &quot;doesn&#39;t protect members of the transgender community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether a transgender person could pursue in state court a discrimination case using laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex (gender) or on sexual orientation. What is clear is Wisconsin laws do not expressly prohibit discrimination based on a person&rsquo;s status as transgender. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Rae&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-claim-on-state-law-transgender-discrimination-b99496563z1-303099771.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-08T12:03:59.302853", "ruling_date": "2015-05-08T13:37:23", "ruling_headline": "No gender identity protection in Wisconsin anti-discrimination law, Democratic chair candidate says", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-gender-identity-protection-wisconsin-anti-discr", "ruling_link_text": "No specific coverage for trans-gender people", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Eye, Jason Rae <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J1WCDfI_-Y\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> (quote at 19:40), April 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin legal director <a href=\"http://www.aclu-wi.org/leadership\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Larry DuPuis</u></a>, May 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty president and general counsel <a href=\"http://www.will-law.org/Home/Staff-Bios/Rick-Esenberg\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rick Esenberg</u></a>, May 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Marquette University law professor and director of the law school&rsquo;s labor and employment law program <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/faculty-and-staff-directory/detail/5431766\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Paul Secunda</u></a>, May 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, attorney and head of the Wisconsin Bar Association civil rights and liberties section Gordon Leech, May 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, U.S. Census Bureau public affairs specialist Virginia Hyer, May 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Civil Liberties Union, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/transgender-people-and-law\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;trans-gender people and the law,&quot;</u></a> accessed May 7, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jason ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3176, "last_name": "Rae", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "jason-rae", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jason_Rae_pfact_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3176/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Wisconsin&#39;s non-discrimination law &quot;doesn&#39;t protect members of the trans-gender community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2015-04-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 117, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/117/", "subject": "Civil Rights", "subject_slug": "civil-rights", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 118, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/118/", "subject": "Gays and Lesbians", "subject_slug": "gays-and-lesbians", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 106, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/106/", "subject": "Housing", "subject_slug": "housing", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 256, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/256/", "subject": "Sexuality", "subject_slug": "sexuality", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/14/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
