Marcy Kaptur has emerged as one of Congress&rsquo; most vocal critics of large financial institutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Toledo Democrat repeated many of her criticisms in an interview on MSNBC&rsquo;S <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt2GtwhX8ho\">Dylan Ratigan show</a>, where she criticized the nation&rsquo;s biggest banks for &quot;reckless&quot; conduct that led to the nation&rsquo;s foreclosure crisis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Six institutions in our country now control two thirds of the capital,&quot; Kaptur said, who contends financial power should be returned to community banks and credit unions with ties to the areas where they do business. &quot;That&rsquo;s too much. It&rsquo;s too much power in too few hands.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statistic Kaptur cited sounded like a big chunk of change for a few institutions to control, so we asked where her numbers came from.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer office cited a book called &quot;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/13-Bankers-Takeover-Financial-Meltdown/dp/0307379051\">13 Bankers</a>&quot; by MIT economist <a href=\"http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/detail.php?in_spseqno=198\">Simon Johnson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-kwak\">James Kwak</a> which contains a table that examines the growth of the nation&rsquo;s six biggest banks: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the chart, the assets of those banks grew from less than 20 percent of the nation&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product in 1995, to roughly 60 percent today. The book argues that these &quot;too big to fail&quot; institutions harm the economy because they stifle competition and take excessive risks because they know the government will bail them out of a disaster. <a href=\"http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/top50form.aspx\">Federal Reserve data </a>backs up Johnson&rsquo;s contention that the six large banks control assets that are roughly 60 percent of the nation&rsquo;s gross domestic product.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statistic that inspired Kaptur&rsquo;s remarks checks out, but there&rsquo;s a problem with her statement. The chart refers to bank assets, not bank capital, as Kaptur said. And there&rsquo;s a big difference between the two.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssets encompass everything a bank owns, including buildings and loans to customers. Capital is what&rsquo;s left on a bank&rsquo;s balance sheet after its liabilities &ndash; like customer deposits that can be withdrawn at any time &ndash; are subtracted from assets. The federal reserve considers banks to be adequately capitalized if their capital is more than eight percent of its assets, says <a href=\"http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/economists/ergungor/\">Emre Ergungor</a>, a senior research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohnson said Kaptur&rsquo;s underlying point about the concentration of power in the hands of a few banks was correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My overall assessment - Rep. Kaptur should have said &lsquo;six institutions in our country now have assets worth over 60 percent of GDP&rsquo; (or less technical words to that effect),&quot; Johnson said in an e-mail. &quot;But she is right that (a) the size of assets controlled by our largest institutions has gone up a lot in recent years, including after the financial crisis, and (b) this is an economic problem of first order importance for the United States -- this is the point of 13 Bankers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe agree with Johnson. And had Kaptur said something like that, she would have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA basic tenet PolitiFact uses to evaluate statements is that words matter. In this case, by using the word &quot;capital,&quot; rather than &quot;assets,&quot; she turned the accuracy of her statement upside down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s why we rate her statement as False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-27T15:49:43.904344", "ruling_date": "2011-01-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
