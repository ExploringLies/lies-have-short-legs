He&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/billpeduto/status/870369217031397377\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a>, &quot;Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world &amp; will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton.&quot; At a press conference in Pittsburgh with local reporters Thursday, Peduto repeated this claim: &quot;The people of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton, 80 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peduto&rsquo;s spokesperson Timothy McNulty said Friday the mayor got the number &quot;off the top of his head&quot; and noted the numbers weren&rsquo;t that different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During an appearance on CNN late Thursday, Peduto qualified his earlier statement: &quot;The city of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton with nearly 80 percent of the vote. [Trump] may be talking about all of western Pennsylvania, but it&rsquo;s a far cry from being Pittsburgh.&quot; And while on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; on MSNBC, Peduto again stuck with the same claim: &quot;Actually in Pittsburgh, Hillary Clinton won with nearly 80 percent of the vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Clinton win the city by that majority?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost. Allegheny County election records show that Clinton won 75 percent of the vote in the city of Pittsburgh, while she won 56 percent of the vote county-wide.&nbsp;We calculated Clinton&rsquo;s vote total using precinct-level data published&nbsp;by the county through the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said he was elected to represent people from Pittsburgh, not Paris, when explaining why he decided to withdraw the U.S. from a global climate deal. Pittsburgh&rsquo;s mayor, Bill Peduto, responded by tweeting that Hillary Clinton received 80 percent of the vote in Pittsburgh. Clinton received 75 percent of the vote. That&rsquo;s pretty close; Clinton did win the city by an overwhelming number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-02T14:02:50.456744", "ruling_date": "2017-06-02T14:03:55", "ruling_headline": "Did 80% of Pittsburgh really vote for Hillary Clinton?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-80-percent-pittsburgh-really-vote-hillary-clin", "ruling_link_text": "The comeback to Pittsburgh vs. Paris", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Allegheny County, <a href=\"http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/PA/Allegheny/63905/Web02/#/\">2016 General Election Official Results</a>, accessed June 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview on CNN&rsquo;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/01/politics/pittsburgh-mayor-donald-trump/\">The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer</a>,&quot; June 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview on MSNBC&rsquo;s &quot;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hardball/videos/1349860668431698/\">Hardball with Chris Matthews</a>,&quot; June 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Timothy McNulty, spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto, June 2, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3961, "last_name": "Peduto", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "bill-peduto", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/peduto_headshot.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Pennsylvania", "edition": "Pennsylvania", "edition_slug": "pennsylvania", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 54, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Pennsylvania Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/54/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3961/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a tweet", "statement_date": "2017-06-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Pittsburgh or Paris?
