Opioid deaths have tripled on his watch and there have been cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis,&quot; Cordray said in <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/medicaid-expansion-key-opioid-abuse-fight-cordray-says-springsfield/CJ96kntfopiCspSDydiaxL/\">Springfield</a> June 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray has previously pointed the finger saying DeWine and Republicans were <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/ohio/articles/2018-03-26/democrat-cordray-would-declare-opioid-emergency-as-governor\">&quot;asleep at the switch&quot;</a> on opioids and that DeWine <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2018/05/rich_cordray_says_mike_dewines.html\">&quot;did nothing about it.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray&rsquo;s statement is an overreach. Although Ohio is one of the hardest hit states by opioid overdoses, this is a national problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/index.html\">Opioids</a> (including <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/prescribed.html\">prescription opioids</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/heroin.html\">heroin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/opioids/fentanyl.html\">fentanyl</a>) killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, more than any year on record. About 40 percent of all opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid. In October, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/oct/30/opioid-epidemic-united-states-and-trump-administra/\">President Donald Trump </a>declared a national emergency. The over-prescribing of opioids began in the mid 1990s amid a marketing campaign telling doctors that they should prescribe more opioids to help ease patients&rsquo; pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University, said it is &quot;silly&quot; to blame DeWine &mdash;&nbsp;or any other state attorney general &mdash;&nbsp;for the increase in overdose deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are certain levers attorney generals can pull to impact opioids, but they would not have any short-term impact on opioid deaths,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&nbsp;&quot;Opioid deaths have tripled on (Mike DeWine&rsquo;s) watch&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray&#39;s campaign cited <a href=\"https://www.odh.ohio.gov/-/media/ODH/ASSETS/Files/health/injury-prevention/2016-Ohio-Drug-Overdose-Report-FINAL.pdf\">state health data</a> showing opioid overdose deaths tripled from 1,163 in 2011 to 3,495 in 2016, overlapping with DeWine&rsquo;s tenure. Cordray was elected attorney general in November 2008 to fill a vacancy, and he lost his bid to keep the seat to DeWine in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZIkdAd3ecwC06el9tBBECljUBgCrLrH7cAApJ83GMRFlvx11xUdiLBaZeRwO0in77T0DuDXiE2GPmM8jpL8UoR-dkfaMODR_6f-yYBrGPvr-ESQPsLRdbaUhqSYe22y9Z9wao_it\" style=\"height:424px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data shows that one of the key reasons behind the spike in overdoses was the increase in deaths from <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/fentanyl-faq.shtml\">fentanyl</a>, which is up to 50 times more potent than heroin. These overdoses soared from 73 in 2011 to 2,357 in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To tackle the epidemic, DeWine filed has lawsuits against <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/ohio-sues-pharmaceutical-drug-opioid-epidemic-mike-dewine.html\">drug manufacturers</a> in 2017 and <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2018/02/26/ohio-sues-cardinal-health-and-other-distributors.html\">drug distributors</a> in 2018. He has also devoted money to assist <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/July-2017/Three-Million-in-Grants-for-DART-and-QRT-Teams-%281%29\">addicts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/May-2018/Attorney-General-DeWine-Releases-Interim-Report-on\">victims</a>, added scientists and equipment to test drugs, sponsored training for law enforcement, formed a <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/November-2013/Attorney-General-DeWine-Announces-Formation-of-New\">heroin unit</a> and negotiated an agreement to reimburse local agencies that use <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/November-2016/Public-Interest-Price-for-Adapt-Pharma-Naloxone-to\">Naloxone</a>, a treatment to stop overdoses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But bringing the epidemic under control requires reducing the incidence of new people addicted and increasing access to treatment. Those goals are not under the purview of an attorney general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not think it makes sense to blame the attorney general,&quot; said Kolodny. &quot;I think there is a lot of blame to go around but pointing to a single state official is silly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kolodny has criticized the federal response both under Trump and Barack Obama and called for more federal money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orman Hall, who worked in Gov. John Kasich&rsquo;s administration on the opioid epidemic, said he doesn&rsquo;t believe law enforcement will solve this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeWine effectively used his bully pulpit and put forth a good-faith effort to deal with the problem. However, as the attorney general, he doesn&rsquo;t have access to funds to significantly impact treatment or the health care system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeWine countered that it was Cordray <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2018/05/rich_cordray_says_mike_dewines.html\">&quot;who was asleep&quot; </a>on the issue of opioids when he was attorney general, a position he held before DeWine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also misguided to blame Cordray, because when he was attorney general the state didn&rsquo;t yet fully understand the extent of the problem but was beginning to take action, Hall said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Everybody made a good faith effort,&quot; Hall said. &quot;Nobody has done anything very successful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&quot;Cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis.&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray&rsquo;s campaign pointed to news reports about the state budget cutting money to local governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of those <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/topics/finance/gov-state-aid-revenue-sharing-intergovernmental-revenue.html?r\">cuts </a>started before DeWine was attorney general and then were exacerbated amid a nearly $8 billion budget shortfall in 2011. Kasich initiated reductions to the state&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.tax.ohio.gov/portals/0/communications/publications/local_government_fund.pdf\">Local Government Fund</a>, which is used by local governments for any purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cuts by the state led to cuts for police, fire and other local services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart, a <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2018/05/rich_cordray_says_mike_dewines.html\">Republican who endorsed Cordray</a>, told PolitiFact that the cuts hurt law enforcement&rsquo;s ability to investigate crimes, including crimes related to opioids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray spokesman Mike Gwin said that DeWine &quot;failed in his responsibility to stand up for law enforcement - to fight for additional money in the state budget for badly-needed resources for the first responders, sheriffs, and police officers on the front lines of this fight.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as attorney general, DeWine doesn&rsquo;t oversee the state budget signed by Kasich and can&rsquo;t be blamed for state budget cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray said, &quot;Opioid deaths have tripled on (Mike DeWine&rsquo;s) watch and there have been cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opioid deaths tripled between 2011 and 2016. However, there is no evidence that DeWine bears responsibility for the spike in overdoses, something that occurred nationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state budget did cut money to local governments but as attorney general, DeWine doesn&rsquo;t set the overall state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a kernel of truth here in that the deaths did triple on DeWine&rsquo;s watch and Kasich did sign state budgets that cut money to local governments, but Cordray has failed to provide evidence that as attorney general DeWine is to blame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-11T10:38:34.209559", "ruling_date": "2018-06-12T10:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Richard Cordray casts some blame on Mike DeWine for opioid overdoses in Ohio", "ruling_headline_slug": "richard-cordray-casts-some-blame-mike-dewine-opioi", "ruling_link_text": "Not an attorney general's fault", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Dayton Daily News</em>, <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/medicaid-expansion-key-opioid-abuse-fight-cordray-says-springsfield/CJ96kntfopiCspSDydiaxL/\">&quot;Medicaid expansion key in opioid abuse fight, Cordray says in Springfield,&quot; </a>June 4, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General, <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/May-2018/Attorney-General-DeWine-Releases-Interim-Report-on\">&quot;Attorney General DeWine Releases Interim Report on Pilot Program Helping Families Overcome Substance Abuse Issues and Reducing Childhood Trauma,&quot;</a> May 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General, <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/February-2018/Attorney-General-DeWine-Files-Lawsuit-Against-Opio\">&quot;Attorney General DeWine Files Lawsuit Against Opioid Distributors for Practices Fueling Opioid Diversion,&quot;</a> Feb. 26, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General news release, <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/July-2017/Three-Million-in-Grants-for-DART-and-QRT-Teams-%281%29\">&quot;Three Million in Grants for DART and QRT Teams to be Available to Address Opioid Epidemic,&quot;</a> July 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General news release, <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/May-2017/Attorney-General-DeWine-Files-Lawsuit-Against-Opio\">&quot;Attorney General DeWine Files Lawsuit Against Opioid Manufacturers for Fraudulent Marketing; Fueling Opioid Epidemic,&quot;</a> May 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General news release, <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/November-2013/Attorney-General-DeWine-Announces-Formation-of-New\">Attorney General DeWine Announces Formation of New Heroin Unit</a>, Nov. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General, <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/October-2012/Pill-Mill-Owner-Sentenced-to-10-Years-in-Prison\">News</a> <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/January-2012/Attorney-General-DeWine-Announces-Dayton-Area-Pill\">releases</a> <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/April-2013/Attorney-General-DeWine-U-S-Attorney-Stewart-A-(1)\">about</a> <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/March-2013/Attorney-General-DeWine-Announces-Raid-of-Suspecte\">pill</a> mills, 2012-2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General news release,<a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/April-2015/Overdose-Prevention-Task-Force-Issues-Recommendati\"> &quot;Overdose Prevention Task Force Issues Recommendations,&quot;</a> April 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Attorney General news release, <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/November-2016/Public-Interest-Price-for-Adapt-Pharma-Naloxone-to\">&quot;Public Interest Price for Adapt Pharma Naloxone to Freeze for One Year in Ohio,&quot;</a> Nov. 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henry J.
