Tommy Thompson loves talking about about the good old days of Wisconsin&rsquo;s economy as he runs in the GOP primary for an open U.S. Senate seat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmid continuing high unemployment in the Badger State and across the nation, Thompson often redirects voters to the mid- to late-1990s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We created 740,000 jobs &ndash; can you imagine that? &ndash; a record for the state!&quot; Thompson proclaimed in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3viVV3x3-g\">March 3, 2012 speech at a party caucus meeting in Sauk County</a>. &quot;The state was in bad shape, and we turned it completely around. Our unemployment dropped down to 2.1 percent &hellip; (and was) the lowest in the country for 40 consecutive months. The lowest in the country!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his familiar cheerleading style, he added: &quot;Then, we were so good, people were so excited, we went to the Rose Bowl and we won three times!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin&rsquo; economic success in Thompson&rsquo;s time -- as well as gridiron glory in Pasadena -- is well-established. The Badgers won all three Rose Bowl trips during Thompson&rsquo;s era, and not once during his governor&rsquo;s tenure (1987 to 2001) did unemployment rise to the February 2012 mark of 6.9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut did the state really lead the nation in shrinking unemployment -- and for more than three years?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the official scorekeeper of labor market performance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers showed some things for Thompson to crow about.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut on the specific claim, it is more along the lines of eating crow.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Thompson won the job, the small-town lawyer and legislator inherited a tough -- but dramatically improving -- unemployment picture. Four years before his election, unemployment peaked at 11.5 percent in January 1983, but it had fallen to 6.6 percent as he took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder Thompson, the rate dropped for three more years, jumped around for a couple, then dropped slowly for seven years before heading back up in his last full year, 2000. This trend line mirrored the national one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin unemployment rate was 3.9 percent as Thompson left in February 2001 for a cabinet post in President George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration -- an improvement over that 6.6 mark in his first month as chief executive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Historical footnote: it would climb to 5.3 percent within 10 months after he departed.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his Sauk County speech, Thompson said unemployment dropped all the way down to 2.1 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the most commonly used official figures show Wisconsin&rsquo;s low was 3.0 percent, achieved in six different months during that time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s according to seasonally adjusted figures, which BLS officials told us are preferred for month-to-month comparisons. In addition, Wisconsin governors have long relied on and emphasized the seasonally adjusted figures when announcing unemployment figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, they are treated as the official numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven Thompson, as he left office, used the seasonal numbers, saying the low point in his tenure was around 3 percent, according to media coverage at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked about the claim, Thompson&rsquo;s campaign pointed to data that is not seasonally adjusted. The rate was 2.0 percent in September 1999, according to a <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/1999/35c6_536.htm\">Thompson administration press release</a> from December of 1999. However, the federal data shows a 2.4 percent unadjusted rate for that month, likely because figures are preliminary when announced, and later get updated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the 2.1 percent figure doesn&rsquo;t hold up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow let&rsquo;s examine Thompson&rsquo;s national comparison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWas Wisconsin No. 1?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe couldn&rsquo;t find a single month -- much less 40 straight months -- in which Wisconsin&rsquo;s unemployment rate was lowest among the states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, its rate was in the very bottom tier for most of the 1990s -- bottom five or 10, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Nebraska and the Dakotas consistently beat Wisconsin&rsquo;s numbers throughout the decade. And Minnesota, Iowa and Indiana -- other Midwestern states -- put up lower figures when Wisconsin was its best in 1998, 1999 and 2000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, this held true even when the data was not seasonally adjusted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReacting to our findings, a campaign official said Thompson actually was referring to the city of Madison when he said &quot;lowest in the nation.&quot; The campaign also noted the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate was below the national average for well over 40 months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Thompson cited a statewide number in his claim. And he didn&rsquo;t say below the average. He said lowest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://rightwingnews.com/uncategorized/former-wisconsin-gov-tommy-thompson-spoke-to-the-sauk-county-gop-today-and-i-just-happened-to-be-nearby/\">speech in Sauk County</a>, Thompson contended Wisconsin&rsquo;s unemployment rate dipped to 2.1 percent and was lowest in the nation for more than three years running when he sat in the governor&rsquo;s chair.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal statistics clearly refute the &quot;lowest in the nation&quot; claim, and the 2.1 percent is on target only if you cite preliminary numbers from a less-preferred statistical method.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-23T17:18:14.568943", "ruling_date": "2012-03-26T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tommy Thompson says Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate was the lowest in the nation when he was governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "tommy-thompson-says-wisconsins-unemployment-rate-w", "ruling_link_text": "Not even one month", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSauk County caucus, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3viVV3x3-g\">video excerpt</a> of Thompson speech, March 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and email interview, Vartan Djihanian, deputy campaign manager, Tommy Thompson for Senate Inc., March 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/\">Local Area Program Unemployment home page</a>, accessed March 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRight Wing News, <a href=\"http://rightwingnews.com/uncategorized/former-wisconsin-gov-tommy-thompson-spoke-to-the-sauk-county-gop-today-and-i-just-happened-to-be-nearby/\">Thompson post by TrogloPundit</a>, March 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Tommy", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 14, "last_name": "Thompson", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "tommy-thompson", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-tommythompson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/14/", "total_count": 29, "true_count": 3, "website": "https://www.tommyforwisconsin.com/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=2&gclid=CPiG95D88qwCFUJjTAodElamlg"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays when he was governor, Wisconsin cut unemployment to 2.1 percent and the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate was &quot;the lowest in the country for 40 consecutive months.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2012-03-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
