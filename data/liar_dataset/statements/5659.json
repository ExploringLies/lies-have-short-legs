Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the math:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExxon Mobil Corp. estimates <a href=\"http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/Files/news_release_earnings_4q11.pdf\">it earned $41 billion</a> in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDivide by 365 days in the year and 24 hours in a day &mdash; and that&rsquo;s $4.67 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEvery hour.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama has previously struggled with the facts about Exxon&rsquo;s profit. In 2007, he claimed the company&rsquo;s profits had never been higher, when that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/31/barack-obama/hes-a-year-too-late-on-this-energy-claim/\">wasn&rsquo;t true at the time.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast year, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., was on stronger ground when he declared that &quot;over the past decade, the big five oil companies &mdash; BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell &mdash; made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion.&quot; PolitiFact Virginia rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/apr/11/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-top-five-oil-us-companies-raked/\">Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis time, Exxon answered the president <a href=\"http://www.exxonmobilperspectives.com/2012/03/30/big-oil-big-taxes/\">on its blog</a>, saying &quot;the reality is that statistics such as by-the-hour profits only tell part of the story.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Consider if the president had added the following statistics: ExxonMobil&rsquo;s taxes were $12.3 million an hour, and it took more than $47 million an hour to run the global business. Those statistics are also accurate and they put the $4.7 million an hour in profits in context.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(We should note that we can&rsquo;t independently verify the company&rsquo;s tax bill. As we&rsquo;ve reported before, the actual income tax, for example, paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. We have dinged politicians for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/10/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-filibuster-exxon-mobil/\">inaccurately</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/sep/01/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-exxonmobil-paid-no-taxes-/\">characterizing</a> the company&rsquo;s taxes.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe company has a point that Obama&rsquo;s statistic doesn&#39;t detail the oil company&#39;s expenses. But in this fact-check, we&rsquo;re focusing just on the claim that, &quot;Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.&quot; As a simple snapshot of Exxon&rsquo;s 2011 profit, his arithmetic is right on target.
