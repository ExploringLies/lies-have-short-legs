But the pressure has&nbsp;been rising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran&rsquo;s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS20871.pdf\"><u>according to a report by&nbsp;Kenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service</u></a>, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil exports, which fund nearly half of Iran&rsquo;s government spending, have fallen by about half since 2011, from about 2.5 million barrels a day to about 1.25 million. The drop has&nbsp;been driven, Katzman says, by a European Union embargo and U.S. pressure on Iranian oil customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran also lost access to the international banking system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination has caused a sharp drop in the value of Iran&rsquo;s currency, the rial, Katzman says. Meanwhile, sanctions helped trigger a recession that&rsquo;s driving up unemployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has that meant &quot;30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment,&quot; as Reich told ABC viewers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s not a simple answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inflation estimates range from <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS20871.pdf\"><u>30 percent to 70 percent</u></a>. Official unemployment statistics, meanwhile, are out of date, and outside experts question their accuracy, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development don&rsquo;t have up-to-date figures for Iranian unemployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Reich&rsquo;s in range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has studied sanctions for 30 years, said Reich&rsquo;s numbers &quot;seem reasonable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how the Congressional Research Service put it in June:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>Inflation: 30 percent plus, according to Iran Central Bank in May 2013, but believed to be over 50 percent by outside experts.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>Unemployment rate: Official rate is 15.3 percent as of the end of 2011, but outside experts believe the rate is higher.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reich pointed us to news articles from the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/06/04/iran-supreme-leader-tells-presidential-candidates-it-wrong-to-appease-west/\"><u>Associated Press</u></a> and energy news site <a href=\"http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Growing-Unemployment-and-Civil-Unrest-The-Real-Picture-in-Iran.html\"><u>OilPrice.com</u></a> &mdash; which offer some support for his numbers while highlighting the uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Associated Press reported in June inflation &quot;over 30 percent,&quot; though it cited a 14 percent unemployment rate. OilPrices.com noted Sept. 19 that analysts outside the country&nbsp;found that&nbsp;unemployment rate &quot;impossible to believe,&quot; and quoted an estimate from Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian-born economic adviser to the European Union, of more than 20 percent. (The OilPrices.com report echoes a Reuters report from the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/19/us-iran-unemployment-idUSBRE88I0TA20120919\"><u>same day</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So &quot;reasonable&quot; seems like a fair assessment for Reich&rsquo;s numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also note there&rsquo;s not universal agreement on the size of sanctions&rsquo; role in all that financial pain, which experts also attribute to Iran&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/10/us-iran-election-economy-analysis-idUSBRE95905I20130610\"><u>fiscal management</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley with a background in economics, told PolitiFact it just makes sense unemployment and inflation would follow a slash in oil exports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The typical consequence for a nation dependent on exports when those exports are cut is high inflation and high unemployment,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Malloy, a professor at the University of the Pacific&rsquo;s McGeorge School of Law who specializes in banking regulation and economic sanctions, told PolitiFact &quot;it&#39;s likely to be a much more complicated picture.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reich told ABC viewers that under economic sanctions, &quot;now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation&quot; and &quot;20 percent unemployment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran&rsquo;s own statistics aren&rsquo;t widely trusted and international organizations don&rsquo;t have recent unemployment figures. But those numbers fall within a broad range of expert estimates cited by news reports and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Iran&rsquo;s economic struggle has been exacerbated by its own economic policies and other factors, not just sanctions. Still, there&rsquo;s good evidence they&rsquo;ve had a &quot;huge impact,&quot; as Reich said.
