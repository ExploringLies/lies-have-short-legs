He was buried in his hometown of Hope, Ark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conspiracy theories have raged for years that the Clintons actually had Foster killed for his knowledge of the Whitewater real estate deal or some other insight. President Donald Trump is among those who have <a href=\"https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/donald-trumps-irresponsible-claims-about-vince-foster/\">questioned whether Foster actually committed suicide</a>, despite five different investigations concluding he suffered a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post, meanwhile, is fake, and has <a href=\"https://conspiracydailyupdate.com/2017/03/24/breaking-autopsy-results-from-vince-fosters-exhumed-body-cause-of-death-to-be-changed/\">ended up</a> <a href=\"http://nesaranews.blogspot.com/2017/03/breaking-autopsy-results-from-vince.html\">on other</a> <a href=\"http://usapoliticsnow.com/breaking-autopsy-results-vince-fosters-exhumed-body-cause-death-changed/\">fake news</a> websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It says that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., had ordered Foster&rsquo;s body exhumed. It cited a U.S. Navy officer as saying the forensics lab at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Va., determined Foster suffered two gunshot wounds, and his death should be reclassified as a homicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foster&rsquo;s body has not been exhumed, and there is no Naval Hospital in Norfolk &mdash; although there is a <a href=\"http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcp/SitePages/home.aspx\">Naval Medical Center</a> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Naval+Medical+Center+Portsmouth/@36.8359406,-76.3192297,13.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x39e43023a933d3b5!8m2!3d36.8440077!4d-76.3047771\">across the Elizabeth River</a> in Portsmouth, which used to be known as Naval Hospital Portsmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post is accompanied by a photo that purports to be of naval forensics specialists, but <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/autopsy2.htm\">actually is a handout photo</a> from the Sacramento County (Calif.)
