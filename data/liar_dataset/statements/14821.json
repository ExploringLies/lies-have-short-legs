(Other deductions <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/03/paul-ryan/would-house-gop-tax-plan-save-typical-family-1182/\">eliminated or pared back</a> in the House bill include the mortgage interest deduction, and the state and local tax deduction.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marr told us IRS data shows that in 2015, 55 percent of Wisconsin tax filers with an income between $75,000 and $100,000 claimed itemized deductions instead of the standard deduction. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.
