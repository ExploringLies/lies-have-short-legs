U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin who has won kudos from some deficit hawks, is churning out essays and press releases on it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Georgia&rsquo;s U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, is putting his own spin on the subject. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I find it very troubling that the president is asking to increase the nation&rsquo;s debt limit when his Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days,&quot; Isakson said in a Jan. 26 press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s about three years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe grabbed our calculator and got to work with the help of our sister sites PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, who have analyzed other claims on the same subject.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut before we proceed with our fact check, it helps to explain how Congress comes up with its federal budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is how it works: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf a budget resolution doesn&rsquo;t pass, the federal government won&rsquo;t go dark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBudget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money. &nbsp;If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs a previous PolitiFact National story said, &quot;the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority&#39;s organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson&rsquo;s claim is accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats &quot;passed&quot; a budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30297.pdf\">report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn&rsquo;t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats &quot;have gone without any budget at all&quot; for more than 1,000 days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIsakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to &quot;submit&quot; -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress&rsquo; proceedings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn April 26, 2010, under the heading &quot;Submitted Resolutions,&quot; is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He&rsquo;s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA resolution is &quot;submitted&quot; when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly&rsquo;s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad&rsquo;s submission of the budget resolution as a &quot;gimmick.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour,&quot; the email said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democrat-controlled Senate didn&rsquo;t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don&rsquo;t intend to put one up this year, either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIsakson&rsquo;s claim that the &quot;Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days&quot; needs some revision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, this flaw in Isakson&rsquo;s statement doesn&rsquo;t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven&rsquo;t submitted one since. In the past few years, Senate Democrats have taken limited action on budget resolutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement contains a kernel of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It meets our definition of Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-13T18:14:19.127832", "ruling_date": "2012-03-14T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Isakson: Democrats failed to submit budget in past 1,000 days", "ruling_headline_slug": "isakson-democrats-failed-submit-budget-1000-days", "ruling_link_text": "Claim needs revision ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPress release, U.S. Sen.
