What liberal media will try to hide, we will uncover.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of how that particular Google search displayed the 70news post -- prominently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LrgEim0q4fEN66D-vB6s_oRPnRMVCEw36pG9sK3H6RS5enAysUr3bhMzRRinmyjLMPS5Cs3JE67y94q1aDVkkIRn7lgyb1jKhWseO-TYRnk_Fm6MXS73l-aK2xzNBPXRjMUuEAZL\" style=\"border:none; height:654px; width:596px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">But while it&rsquo;s absolutely true that Trump won the Electoral College vote -- which is the only thing that matters in determining who moves into the White House on Jan. 20 -- he is not leading in the popular vote.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The most comprehensive vote-tracking <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/htmlview?sle=true#gid=19\">analysis</a> is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 14, according to Wasserman&rsquo;s calculations, Clinton led Trump by 784,748 votes -- specifically, 61,422,098 for Clinton, 60,637,350 for Trump, and 6,691,311 for other candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other tallies showed similar results. <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/election\">CNN</a> at that time showed a Clinton-over-Trump margin of 668,059, while the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/features/2016-election-results/\">Associated Press</a> had a margin of 668,483. (Different media outlets may report different numbers at a given time because of delays in obtaining and uploading new data.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s CNN&rsquo;s tally by mid-day Nov. 14, showing Clinton ahead by half a percentage point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XzYfvtFNGKw97H4PJePcmBErDZmsMd4wBJ6sL68dw5voZSW_Fln-GYl6aJGfkG-O-q58EsIaduoxFIbnAEseeyKIpR1viAPPxidD9dfoiumpNGa_RY871u2pjmrvPl0GHCszxPNl\" style=\"border:none; height:393px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And given the votes left to be counted, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to imagine that Trump will gain back ground in the coming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because California -- a state where Clinton is beating Trump by a 62 percent-33 percent margin -- has the most votes still to count of any state. Nearly a week after the election, CNN <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/election/results/states/california#president\">estimates</a> that only 70 percent of the California vote had been counted. In addition, only 87 percent of the vote in Oregon had been counted; Clinton beat Trump 52 percent-41 percent there. And Washington state had counted only 87 percent of its vote; Clinton beat Trump there by a 55 percent-38 percent margin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s entirely plausible that Clinton could end up winning the popular vote by 1 million to 1.5 million votes -- roughly two or three times the popular-vote margin assembled by Al Gore when he lost the Electoral College, and the presidency, to George W. Bush in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Nov. 14, the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/14/googles-top-news-link-for-final-election-results-goes-to-a-fake-news-site-with-false-numbers/\">Washington Post</a></em> and <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-playing-inaccurate-top-news-search-result-about-popular-vote-2016-11\">Business Insider</a> both posted articles questioning why Google still had the 70news article at the top of their news category. A Google representative said the company was looking into the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And on Nov. 14, 70news posted an update: &quot;Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. &hellip; If I&rsquo;m wrong, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to change the numbers. It&rsquo;s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it&rsquo;s out there already.&quot; (The Twitter post cited by 70News was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Koxinga8/status/797399664853032960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">this one</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as of 3 p.m. on Nov. 14, 70news still had the article up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media was abuzz with the claim that the &quot;final election 2016 numbers&quot; showed that Trump had won won both the popular and Electoral College contests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump certainly won the Electoral College vote, and as a result, he will become president. But he clearly trails in the popular vote. As of this writing, Clinton is ahead by nearly 800,000 votes, a margin that is likely to expand further as late returns trickle in from California, Oregon and Washington state, all of which are strong Clinton states.
