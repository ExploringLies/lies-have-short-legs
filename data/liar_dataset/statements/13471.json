(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gun murder rate measures the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 residents in a geographical area. A separate measurement, the gun death rate, takes a broader look including homicides, suicides and accidental shooting deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our research and contact with Newsom&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, it appears the lieutenant governor mixed up the two rates and ended up understating the drop in California&rsquo;s gun murder rate by more than 10 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s <em>gun death rate</em> -- not the gun murder rate -- dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013, according to figures provided by Ari Freilich, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention. The attorney cited age-adjusted <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_injury_reports.html\">data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nonprofit law center advocates for gun control laws and is considered an authority on gun crime statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law center&rsquo;s figures do not include data from 2014, a year in which gun deaths and gun homicides continued to fall in California. Nor do they include statistics from 2015 and 2016, which are not yet available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the 20-year span is the approximate period during which California imposed strict new gun laws, spurred by mass shootings years earlier on a Stockton schoolyard and inside a San Francisco law office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This meant the rate of deaths by any kind of shooting declined from 17.48 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 7.68 per 100,000 residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Larger drop in gun murder rate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this same period, California&rsquo;s <em>gun murder rate</em> declined even faster: By 65 percent, according to a review of the CDC&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/fatal_injury_reports.html\">fatal injury reports</a> by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from these reports have been cited by both gun control and <a href=\"http://www.calgunlaws.com/more-guns-less-crime-california-style/\">gun rights groups</a> to describe California&rsquo;s decline in gun violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They show gun murders fell from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 (when 1,233 were killed) compared with 1993&nbsp;(when 3,183&nbsp;were killed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during much of the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people, according to a Pew Research analysis in 2015 of available federal data. Since then, Pew reported, the rate has remained relatively flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has seen a &quot;56 percent decline in the gun murder rate&quot; since it enacted strong gun control laws in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom appears to have mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. California&rsquo;s gun murder rate dropped 67 percent between 1993 and 2014, according to a review of fatal injury report data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar, though somewhat smaller, drop in the gun murder rate took place nationwide during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His claim needs this key clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/21282e24-9e4d-4493-be54-4e319e129524\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/21282e24-9e4d-4493-be54-4e319e129524</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-16T16:55:43.211688", "ruling_date": "2016-11-16T14:23:20", "ruling_headline": "Gavin Newsom understates California\u2019s big drop in gun homicides", "ruling_headline_slug": "gavin-newsom-understates-californias-rapid-drop-gu", "ruling_link_text": "Gun control champ understates drop in gun homicides", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>California Lt.
