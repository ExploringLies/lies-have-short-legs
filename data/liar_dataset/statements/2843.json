So there&#39;s 44 other states that don&#39;t have it,&quot; Chafee told reporters after an unrelated news conference Monday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe point he was trying to make is that E-Verify is not a widely used program and one he believes may not be effective.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered how many states actually require use of E-Verify. But first, a little background.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-Verify is a free, federal database that compares information from a person&#39;s employment paperwork to Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don&#39;t match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the worker eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat sounds like a foolproof system quickly came under fire. Critics complained that the database was inaccurate and demanded that it be improved before E-Verify was widely implemented.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDespite that criticism, companies increasing began using the program on a voluntary basis. One by one, some states too started mandating E-Verify checks. In 2008, Rhode Island became one of them when Governor Donald Carcieri announced a multi-part executive order intended to curb illegal immigration. One of the key elements of the order required the state&#39;s executive branch and companies doing business with the state to use E-Verify for new employees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(The federal government began requiring use of E-Verify for government contractors in September 2009).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJust how many states require the use of E-Verify? Contrary to what Chafee told reporters, the number is 13 -- 26 percent -- according to data from the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are variations in how states employ E-Verify. Idaho, North Carolina and Virginia require E-Verify checks on state employees, while Colorado mandates that only state contractors use the system. Like Rhode Island, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma require both.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Arizona, Mississippi and Utah mandate that all employers statewide use the program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(South Carolina requires employers to verify the legal status of their workers, either through E-Verify or by checking their drivers&#39; licenses.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile those statistics make clear that Chafee has his facts wrong, we were inclined to give him a little leeway on this one, for a couple of reasons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, he said he believed only six states used E-Verify, implying he didn&#39;t know for sure. And when Carcieri issued his well-publicized executive order, the number of states using E-Verify was closer to six. It has since increased.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked about the discrepancy, Chafee&#39;s transition office explained the governor elect&#39;s statement this way: there are six other states besides Rhode Island that have E-Verify laws that are similar to ours, spokesman Christian Vareika said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo a state that actually has a more sweeping E-Verify policy than Rhode Island should not be included in the total because its program is more extensive? That logic escapes us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVareika stressed what he called Chafee&#39;s larger point. &quot;The vast majority of states do not use E-Verify, so I think the heart of the matter remains true,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there is something else. This is not the first time Chafee has used the six-state figure. Back in June in a gubernatorial candidate forum, Chafee told the crowd: &quot;I would not participate in E-Verify. Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Rhode Island and South Carolina&nbsp; - only six states participate. If it&#39;s so great, is that the kind of company we want? I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy he arbitrarily cited those six states, we&#39;re not sure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe tend to give politicians a pass when they make one slip of the tongue. But not when they repeat incorrect information. In this case, after The Providence Journal quoted him on the &quot;six states&quot; in June, the candidate posted the story on his campaign website where it remained as of Nov. 18.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChafee has repeatedly condemned Carcieri&#39;s executive order and promised to repeal it once he takes office. In challenging such a controversial policy, he owed it to constituents on both sides of the debate to do his homework on the current laws before speaking out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-18T18:20:09.517846", "ruling_date": "2010-11-19T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Chafee says only six states use E-Verify", "ruling_headline_slug": "chafee-says-only-six-states-use-e-verify", "ruling_link_text": "Thirteen states have some sort of E-Verify mandate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGovernor Donald Carcieri&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.governor.ri.gov/documents/executiveorders/2008/01_illegal_immigration_control_order.pdf\">Illegal Immigration Control Order</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Customs and Immigration Services data, emailed, Nov. 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=13127#table\"><br />\r\n\tNational Conference of State Legislatures</a> data<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Christian Vareika, spokeswoman for Governor Elect Lincoln Chafee&#39;s transition team, Nov. 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Providence Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.chafeeforgovernor.com/med/media/index.php?page=13\">R.I.
