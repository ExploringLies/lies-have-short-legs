Mike says their teenage daughter was brutally raped. &quot;You can&rsquo;t imagine what she went through,&quot; he says. &quot;That&rsquo;s why politicians like Scott Walker make me so mad.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe screen goes black. Then as Mike continues, the words he says also appear on the screen:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMike concludes: &quot;Who is Scott Walker to play God with our family?&quot; and -- repeating a common theme from Barrett and the Democratic side -- says he feels Walker is &quot;too extreme for Wisconsin.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs voters weigh their choices in the Nov. 2, 2010, election, there is no dispute that Barrett &nbsp;is pro-choice and Walker is pro-life. But Barrett&rsquo;s claim, which may be new to many viewers of the ad, is that Walker wants to outlaw abortion under any circumstances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt is worth noting that many voters who consider themselves pro-life support make an exception for abortion being available in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. A <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/118399/more-americans-pro-life-than-pro-choice-first-time.aspx\">May 2009 Gallup poll</a>, however, found that 23 percent of Americans -- up from 17 percent a year earlier -- said abortion should be illegal under all circumstances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor his part, Walker has said repeatedly he opposes abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. He declares himself <a href=\"http://www.scottwalker.org/issues/life\">&quot;100 percent pro-life.&quot;</a> And to Pro-Life Wisconsin, an organization that <a href=\"http://www.prolifewisconsin.org/proLifeIssues.asp?article=Can+There+be+Exceptions%3F&amp;aid=286&amp;id=5#topNews\">opposes </a><a href=\"http://www.prolifewisconsin.org/proLifeIssues.asp?article=Can+There+be+Exceptions%3F&amp;aid=286&amp;id=5#topNews\">abortion</a> without exception, Walker pledged to seek a complete abortion ban.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Jill Bader, Walker&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, about Barrett&rsquo;s ad and she said it accurately states Walker&rsquo;s position.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(We would note that as a member of the state Assembly, Walker backed an effort to bar government employees from performing abortions and a bill outlawing &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;; both measures included an exception for when the life of the mother is at stake.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is one item we can assess quickly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the race for governor, Democrat Tom Barrett said his opponent, Republican Scott Walker, &quot;wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.&quot; Walker acknowledges that is his position.
