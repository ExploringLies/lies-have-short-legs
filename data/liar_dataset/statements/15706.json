American Bridge also produced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmBtqS5FlbA\">a video</a> that makes an attack on Nicholson similar to the one in the Baldwin ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the AP article, Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states as they moved to save money and shift production overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples included a company that bought Brillion Iron Works near Green Bay through a subsidiary in September 2016 and two weeks later announced it was shutting down the plant, resulting in a loss of 345 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said Nicholson did consulting for companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it did not say that Nicholson provided any consulting on those decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article also said Nicholson has reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees (which is a total of more than $1.1 million) from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017. But the article did not say how much he was paid for the companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>All of our fact checks in the <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2018/jun/25/fact-tracking-2018-candidates-us-senator/\">Wisconsin U.S. Senate race</a></em>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What we don&rsquo;t know</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An executive for ghSMART, the company that employs Nicholson, told us ghSMART helps companies &quot;interview, evaluate and develop their senior leadership&quot; and &quot;has never advised any clients on whether to close a plant or conduct employee layoffs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Nicholson&rsquo;s campaign has reiterated those points, while also going so far in condemning the AP article as to call the reporter a <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2018/nicholson-campaign-baldwins-attack-ad-proves-she-knows-kevin-nicholson-can-beat-her-in-november/\">&quot;liberal hack.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Nicholson and his company have also described their work as being more broad, involving more than merely advising about executive leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AP pointed out that, according to the ghSMART website, the firm works with companies and investors on &quot;management assessment and organizational change initiatives.&quot; Nicholson himself, the AP noted, has said his job involves helping companies design strategies for growth, assisting with mergers and acquisitions, and problem solving. And Nicholson&rsquo;s campaign has <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2018/nicholson-campaign-baldwins-attack-ad-proves-she-knows-kevin-nicholson-can-beat-her-in-november/\">described his work</a> as &quot;helping companies solve their toughest problems.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short: We simply don&rsquo;t know what Nicholson may have advised the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin says: &quot;New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn Associated Press report said Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it says Nicholson received more than $1 million for his consulting work between January 2016 and November 2017. But it doesn&rsquo;t say how much he was paid for consulting for the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Baldwin cites no evidence to show how much money Nicholson was paid consulting for those companies. And we don&rsquo;t know whether Nicholson&rsquo;s work had anything to do with the layoffs and the shutdowns.
