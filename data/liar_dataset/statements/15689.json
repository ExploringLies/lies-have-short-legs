But there&rsquo;s no evidence on their website that any new mills are on the horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meghan Cox, a spokeswoman for U.S. Steel, told us that Trump wasn&rsquo;t privy to any exclusive information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All of our operational changes have been publicly announced and all information shared with the federal government has been properly disclosed and made available on our website,&quot; Cox said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The White House did not respond to our request for comment.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox pointed to several projects U.S. Steel announced this year. That includes plans to invest $275 million to $325 million in capital projects, announced in February; to construct a new steel-coating line to help PRO-TEC, a subsidiary, make cars in Leipsic, Ohio; and to <a href=\"https://www.ussteel.com/newsroom/united-states-steel-restart-second-granite-city-works-blast-furnace-comments-2018-guidance\">restart</a> two blast furnaces that will create 800 new jobs at an integrated steel-making plant in Granite City. The company idled those furnaces in 2015, laying off about 2,000 workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mills are complex operations, so we asked&nbsp;William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, whether a single plant might be easily mistaken for multiple plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On its face, it makes no sense,&quot; Reinsch said. &quot;A plant is a plant, not a division of something or part of a facility. I don&rsquo;t see how you get to six from anything I know.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of those are new plants, but they represent investment and job-creating activities. That said, other American steelmakers have announced new mills and re-openings this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nucor, a steel manufacturer, announced in November it would open a steel rebar micro-mill in Sedalia, Mo., creating 250 full-time jobs. Nucor will build another mill in Frostproof, Fla., the company announced in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liberty Steel bought and is preparing to reopen a steel mill in Georgetown, S.C. The mill was shuttered by its previous owners in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Big River Steel is investing $1.2 billion to expand its Arkansas steel plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Steel&nbsp;CEO David Burritt did not address the mysterious six mills in a&nbsp;second quarter conference call with investors Aug. 2. But Burditt affirmed Trump&#39;s support for the steel industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We had an incredibly exciting visit form the president, and his daughter was there as well, and I can tell you the commitment that he has to steel is unprecedented, and the notion that this guy would blink, I think, is not going to happen,&quot; Burritt said.&nbsp;&quot;He knows this kind of unfairness should been taken care of long ago. He&rsquo;s got us, he&rsquo;s with us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between restarts, new mills and expansions, the steel industry has seen significant investment this year. But Trump is wrong. U.S. Steel is restarting two shuttered mills. Other companies are re-opening or building a few other mills. We rate Trump&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-01T18:12:47.514615", "ruling_date": "2018-08-02T12:00:29", "ruling_headline": "No, U.S. Steel is not opening six new mills as Donald Trump said", "ruling_headline_slug": "us-steel-not-opening-six-new-mills-donald-trump", "ruling_link_text": "Zero new plants", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Meghan Cox, U.S. Steel spokeswoman, Aug. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,&nbsp;Aug. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Paul Nathanson, senior principal at Bracewell LLC, Aug. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Steel, <a href=\"https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/nuivbyca\">Q2 conference call</a>, Aug. 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Steel, <a href=\"https://www.ussteel.com/newsroom/united-states-steel-welcomes-president-trump-granite-city-works\">United States Steel Welcomes President Trump to Granite City Works</a>, July 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Steel, <a href=\"https://www.ussteel.com/newsroom/united-states-steel-restart-second-granite-city-works-blast-furnace-comments-2018-guidance\">United States Steel to Restart Second Granite City Works Blast Furnace, Comments on 2018 Guidance</a>, June 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Steel, <a href=\"https://www.ussteel.com/newsroom/united-states-steel-corporation-and-kobe-steel-announce-new-investment-advanced-high\">United States Steel Corporation and Kobe Steel Announce New Investment in Advanced High-Strength Steel Capabilities</a>, Sept. 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Steel, <a href=\"https://www.ussteel.com/sites/default/files/reports_filings/USS%20Earnings%20Call%20Slides%2C%20Remarks%20-%202017%204Q%2CFY.pdf\">4Q and Full Year 2017 Earnings Presentation &amp;
