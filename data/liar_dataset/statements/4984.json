Jon Corzine was ordered to appear Dec. 8 before a House committee investigating the collapse of brokerage MF Global, it was a landmark moment, according to one state senator.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCorzine&rsquo;s testimony marked the first time that federal officials had taken any action dealing with Wall Street in response to the financial crisis that rocked the world a few years ago, state Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) said in a Dec. 9 news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Following the catastrophic, cascading collapse of major investment banks on Wall Street in 2007, which caused the current global economic recession, the United States Government held no one accountable,&quot; Doherty said. &quot;Nobody was prosecuted, no hearings were held and no reforms were implemented.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It is obvious to everyone on Main Street, from the Occupy camps to the Tea Party, that Wall Street is broken. Yet only yesterday did the U.S. Congress take any action.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo prosecutions, no hearings, no reforms? PolitiFact New Jersey says: No way!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince the financial crisis began in 2008 -- not 2007, senator -- federal officials have held numerous public hearings and passed a financial reform law, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile high-profile executives on Wall Street have not faced criminal charges, federal officials have prosecuted cases against other individuals for financial crimes before and during the time of the economic collapse.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty told us his claims are supported by a Dec. 4 segment on 60 Minutes on CBS, which stated &quot;there has not been a single prosecution of a high-ranking Wall Street executive or major financial firm.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an email, Doherty also responded to our charge about the Dodd-Frank Act: &quot;Regarding reform, there has been no reform. If there was reform, how did MF Global take $1.2 Billion of client money from segregated client accounts and now they don&rsquo;t know where the money went? &nbsp;Reform would have stopped that from happening.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review what PolitiFact New Jersey found:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that prominent Wall Street executives have not been prosecuted, according to various news reports. But it&rsquo;s wrong for Doherty to say &quot;nobody&quot; has.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, Lee Farkas was convicted in April of helping to commit a more than $2.9 billion fraud scheme that contributed to the collapse of Alabama-based Colonial Bank, one of the 25 largest banks in the country in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s talk about those hearings and financial reform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCharged with examining the causes of the financial crisis, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission &quot;held 19 days of public hearings&quot; in 2010, according to its website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional committees and subcommittees also have held hearings about the financial crisis. In April 2010, a Senate subcommittee held four hearings about the causes and effects of the crisis, including one when Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein testified.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbout three months later, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reform measures within that legislation include setting up a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. U.S. Senate Republicans recently blocked the nomination for the bureau&rsquo;s first director.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, contrary to what Doherty claimed, it&rsquo;s clear that federal officials have conducted hearings and passed financial reform in the wake of the financial crisis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty also referred to the &quot;current global economic recession,&quot; but economists with the National Bureau of Economic Research have said the recession in the United States ended in June 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a news release, Doherty claimed that following the collapse of major investment banks on Wall Street in 2007, &quot;nobody was prosecuted, no hearings were held and no reforms were implemented.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut major investment banks collapsed in 2008 and there have been some prosecutions, although not targeting high-profile Wall Street executives. Numerous hearings have been held and a financial reform law was enacted last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty has a point about the lack of prosecutions against high-profile Wall Street executives, but his overall argument about inaction by federal officials is flat-out wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/politifact_nj_mike_doherty_cla.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-15T10:55:27.579822", "ruling_date": "2011-12-19T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "State Sen.
