We found that Ukrainian Jews are not being forced to register.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story seems to have originated in Donetsk, a region and a city in eastern Ukraine. On April 7, pro-Russian activists took control of Donetsk&rsquo;s government building. Almost two weeks later, <em><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/04/17/jews-ordered-to-register-in-east-ukraine/7816951/\"><u>USA Today</u></a></em> reported, &quot;Leaflet tells Jews to register in East Ukraine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citing an <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4510688,00.html\"><u>Israeli news article</u></a>, <em>USA Today</em> reported that Jews emerging from a synagogue in Donetsk on April 14 were handed pamphlets asking them to &quot;register&quot; with pro-Russian militants. If Jewish adults refused to register and pay a $50 fee, they&rsquo;d be forced out of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the same day the story appeared, Kerry mentioned the notice in his speech. We reached out to Kerry&#39;s office for evidence, but they pointed us back to his remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost immediately, there were signs that the fliers weren&rsquo;t really coming from any kind of authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The separatist whose signature allegedly appears on the flier -- Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republic Chairman Denis Pushilin, leader of the pro-Russian militants -- denied any connection to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reporters on the ground quickly found that no one was actually being registered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact exchanged emails with Ari Shapiro, an NPR international correspondent reporting from Donetsk, who said there is a real flier, but it went ignored until the media caught on. Shapiro himself went after <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/04/18/304534528/leaflets-given-to-donetsk-jews-made-waves-worldwide-but-not-in-donetsk\">the story</a>&nbsp;and shared his reporting with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You walk down the street with a beard and kippah,&quot; said Yaguda Kellerman, deputy chief of the Donetsk Jewish Community Center, to Shapiro. &quot;And you never experience any problems here. I was born in Donetsk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donetsk chief rabbi Pinchas Vishedski acknowledged the flier&rsquo;s existence, but called it a provocation, Shapiro reported. U.S. media outlets like <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/17/5624696/anti-semitic-flier-ukraine\"><u>Vox</u></a> and the <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117415/relax-ukraine-not-ordering-its-jews-register\"><u>New Republic</u></a> have also questioned its validity. A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/world/europe/efforts-to-register-jews-in-ukraine-are-denounced-and-denied.html?hpw&amp;rref=world\"><em><u>New York Times</u></em><u> report</u></a> from Donetsk said that militants never intended to set up a registry, and the room designated for registering Jews sat empty Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sides -- pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian -- have accused each other of anti-Semitism during this conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An April 15 United Nations report noted that the Association of Jewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine has said incidents are isolated and that Jewish people, generally speaking, don&rsquo;t feel threatened by Ukrainian leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pro-Russia<strong> </strong>rebels have since put out their own flier attacking the original anti-Semitism accusations, Shapiro reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry said Ukrainian Jews are being asked to register. There was a flier, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been issued by any authority.<strong> </strong>No one knows yet who distributed them, but the separatist movement denies issuing the fliers. Jewish community leaders in the area have denounced the pamphlets&rsquo; legitimacy. Reporters on the ground in Donetsk say that the fliers aren&rsquo;t being taken seriously, and no Jews are registering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry&rsquo;s comments included none of that context. It&rsquo;s possible Kerry&rsquo;s comments were drawn from what he considered to be legitimate news reports, but those earlier reports didn&rsquo;t include the full picture of what was going on. Anyone listening to Kerry&rsquo;s remarks would think that the requests were coming from some sort of authority on the ground that had the means to enforce its request, and that&rsquo;s not the case. Kerry&rsquo;s remarks did not accurately convey the situation on the ground in Ukraine. For these reasons, we rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-18T16:16:50.850925", "ruling_date": "2014-04-18T17:36:46", "ruling_headline": "John Kerry says Jews in eastern Ukraine told to register", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-kerry-says-jews-eastern-ukraine-told-register", "ruling_link_text": "No Jewish people are registering", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Ari Shapiro, NPR international correspondent, April 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. State Department, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2014/04/224947.htm\">Remarks With EU High Representative Catherine Ashton After Their Meeting</a>, April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/04/18/304534528/leaflets-given-to-donetsk-jews-made-waves-worldwide-but-not-in-donetsk\">Leaflets Given To Donetsk Jews Made Waves Worldwide, But Not In Donetsk</a>, April 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New Republic</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117415/relax-ukraine-not-ordering-its-jews-register\"><u>Ukraine is not ordering its Jews to register</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/world/europe/efforts-to-register-jews-in-ukraine-are-denounced-and-denied.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0\"><u>Demands that Jews register in Eastern Ukraine are denounced, and denied</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, Ari Shapiro&rsquo;s Donetsk reporting, April 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Pooja Jhunjhunwala, Department of State spokeswoman, April 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/ukraine.asp\"><u>Jews ordered to register in Ukraine</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations Human Rights, &quot;Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine,&quot; April 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/04/17/jews-ordered-to-register-in-east-ukraine/7816951/\"><u>Leaflet tells Jews to register in East Ukraine</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vox, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/17/5624696/anti-semitic-flier-ukraine\"><u>What we know about the pro-Russian flier threatening to round up Ukrainian Jews</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-prepared-to-offer-autonomy-to-eastern-regions-if-russia-pulls-back-troops/2014/04/17/53c64bc0-c5f7-11e3-bf7a-be01a9b69cf1_story.html\"><u>Diplomats reach deal on defusing Ukraine crisis</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/17/what-we-know-about-the-grotesque-leaflet-handed-out-to-jews-in-donetsk/\"><u>What we know about the &lsquo;grotesque&rsquo; leaflet handed out to Jews in Donetsk</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ynet News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4510688,00.html\"><u>Donetsk leaflet: Jews must register or face deportation</u></a>,&quot; April 16, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Secretary of State", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 65, "last_name": "Kerry", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-kerry", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnkerry.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/65/", "total_count": 14, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In the last couple of days, notices were sent (by officials in Ukraine) to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2014-04-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>We strive to make our work completely accurate.
