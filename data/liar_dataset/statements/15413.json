Trump echoed a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/analysis-giuliani-escalates-effort-erode-legitimacy-mueller-probe\">comment</a> by one of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, that pegged the figure at $20 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the Mueller probe really approaching $20 million? It does if you use the most aggressive accounting method. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Looking at direct costs only</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mueller investigation is being funded through mandatory spending, which essentially means it is set up to be free of executive branch influence. However, Justice Department officials do have a degree of oversight to make sure that money isn&rsquo;t wasted, as with any other department office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s office has released one accounting of its expenses so far. The report was released in December 2017, and it covered the first four and a half months of the probe, from May 17-Sept. 30, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the report, the Mueller investigation spent $3.2 million directly during that period. The biggest category was $1.7 million for staff salaries and benefits, while the second-largest was for equipment. Smaller categories included travel, rent, utilities and supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you prorate that amount out to a full year&mdash;the approximate length of the investigation at the time Trump sent his tweet &mdash; it would come to about $8.5 million spent so far. That&rsquo;s well below the $20 million Trump cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it happens, Congress and the White House projects that the Mueller investigation will be racking up costs at an even faster clip than what has been reported so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The special counsel&rsquo;s office is officially budgeted for $10.4 million in direct costs for fiscal year 2018 (running from Oct. 1, 2017, to Sept. 30, 2018), and the Trump administration has earmarked another $10.4 million in its budget request for fiscal year 2019 (running from Oct. 1, 2018 to Sept. 30, 2019).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the investigation ends up spending at this pace, it&rsquo;s possible that it could eventually surpass $20 million in direct costs. That would be speculative, however, because that would occur months in the future, and because we don&rsquo;t know whether the investigation will keep spending money at the same rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Adding in indirect costs</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a different accounting method, however, the $20 million projected cost isn&rsquo;t implausible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A footnote in the report says that the investigation has also incurred $3.5 million in indirect costs, a category it says is &quot;neither legally required&quot; for disclosure nor reported in filings by previous special counsels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mueller&rsquo;s office argues that these indirect expenses don&rsquo;t amount to additional taxpayer expenditures, since these resources &mdash; especially personnel, such as employees of the FBI or other agencies &mdash; would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you do count the indirect expenses, the total comes to $6.7 million spent during those first four and a half months. Prorated to cover the investigation&rsquo;s full first year, the total of direct and indirect expenses reaches $17.9 million. That&#39;s not too far off from $20 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of what&rsquo;s been spent by, authorized for, and requested for the Mueller investigation so far:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Fiscal year</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Start date</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>End Date</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Direct spending</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Indirect spending</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total spent</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Authorized (direct only)</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Requested (direct only)</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>May 17, 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Sept. 30, 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$3.2 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$3.5 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6.7 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$3.9 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>--</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2018</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Oct. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Sept. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Not yet reported</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Not yet reported</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Not yet reported</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$10.4 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>--</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2019</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Oct. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Sept. 30, 2019</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>--</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>--</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>--</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>--</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$10.4 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">How does the Mueller investigation compare historically?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The investigation of President Bill Clinton over Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky &mdash; headed by Kenneth Starr and then by his successor, Robert Ray &mdash; cost upward of $52 million over half a decade.
