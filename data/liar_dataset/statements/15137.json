New rumors have circulated on the Internet that Cyrus is now revisiting that promise and that Trump fans are ruining her career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Singer Miley Cyrus: &lsquo;Trump fans are destroying my career, I can&rsquo;t stand them and I decided to move to&hellip;&rsquo;&quot;&nbsp;read the <a href=\"https://alartsforusa.com/singer-miley-cyrus-trump-fans-are-destroying-my-career-i-cant-stand-them-and-i-decided-to-move-to/\">headline</a> on Daily Washington Report, a blog providing no information about the nature of its content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media&rsquo;s efforts to combat online hoaxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story cites real quotes by Cyrus from an interview she gave to <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7783997/miley-cyrus-cover-story-new-music-malibu\"><em>Billboard</em> magazine</a> in 2017 where she openly spoke about becoming more political following the 2016 election. But the story then makes up new information regarding comments about Trump supporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the article, Cyrus claims to be dissatisfied with her career and blames Trump supporters for her not being a top-selling artist anymore. We found no evidence that Cyrus ever made those comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyrus is also falsely quoted as saying that she believes the amount of hate she has received has to do with Trump supporters and that she will leave the United States if it continues. When searching for the quotes attributed to Cyrus, we found no results of the statements. Celebrity news fact-checking site <a href=\"https://www.gossipcop.com/miley-cyrus-donald-trump-supporters-hurting-career/\">Gossip Cop </a>&nbsp;also confirmed that Cyrus never accused Trump supporters of hurting her album sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find an actual recent interview with <em><a href=\"https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2018/02/27/iconique-its-miley-cyrus/\">Wonderland Magazine</a></em> where Cyrus was featured on the cover. In that interview, she <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/miley-cyrus-reveals-how-her-infamous-vma-performance-changed-her-life-forever-97423\">talked</a> about expanding her career to work on different project, and being in a good place in her life right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyrus&rsquo;s latest album, <em>Younger Now</em>, released in September 2017, hit a peak of No. 3 on the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/miley-cyrus/chart-history/digital-albums/song/1047554\">Billboard charts</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/20-stars-who-pledged-flee-country-trump-was-elected-are-they-945888/item/miley-cyrus-leaving-country-945934\">last year</a> Cyrus threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected president, she <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/353074-miley-cyrus-mocks-previous-pledge-to-leave-us-if-trump-won\">recently</a> backtracked, calling it &quot;ignorant&quot; to leave the country because of the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fake news story said that Miley Cyrus is blaming Trump supporters for her discontentment with her career and that she is planning to leave the United States.
