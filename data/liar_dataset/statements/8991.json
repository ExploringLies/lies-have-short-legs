Focus has shifted from the new government in Kiev, Ukraine&rsquo;s capital, to Crimea, a region Russian troops seized control of Saturday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, politicians and pundits are divided over what the United States&rsquo; role should be in the conflict. <em>Washington Post</em> columnist David Ignatius criticized Putin&rsquo;s actions on <em>Face the Nation</em>, saying Ukraine &quot;is not prepared to go backwards&quot; to a Russian regime. He then offered up some context about Crimea&rsquo;s history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954,&quot; he said. &quot;Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ignatius was correct in saying that Ukraine has only controlled the Crimean Peninsula since 1954 -- a claim we also heard from U.S. Rep. Mike Roger, R-Mich., on <em>Fox News Sunday</em>. Not up on your Soviet history? We&rsquo;ll review the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crimea is an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/02/27/world/europe/ukraine-divisions-crimea.html\"><u>eastern Ukrainian peninsula</u></a> located on the Black Sea. It&rsquo;s connected to the rest of the country by a small strip of land. Out of its 2 million residents, about 60 percent identify as Russian. That&rsquo;s the highest concentration of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Although the territory belongs to Ukraine, Russia stations part of its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol as part of a pre-existing agreement between the two countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Ignatius pointed out, Crimea hasn&rsquo;t always been part of Ukraine. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of what&rsquo;s happened in the region since the Ottoman Empire used the peninsula as a hub for slave trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1783:</strong> Russia annexed Crimea.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1853</strong>: The Crimean War began, lasting three years. Russia lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Crimea remained part of Russia.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1917</strong>: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1921</strong>: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1942</strong>: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1944</strong>: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members&rsquo; alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II. Many returned to Crimea in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1945</strong>: After World War II, the autonomous Soviet republic was dissolved and Crimea became a province of the Soviet Union called the Crimean Oblast.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1954</strong>: Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine. It&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/will-putin-seize-crimea/495074.html\"><u>often reported</u></a> that it was a gesture of goodwill from Khrushchev, who had Ukrainian roots.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1991</strong>: The Soviet Union collapsed. Many expected President Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation, to take Crimea for Russia. But he didn&rsquo;t bring it up <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/forget-kiev-the-real-fight-will-be-for-crimea/495145.html\"><u>during negotiations</u></a> with Ukraine.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>1997</strong>: Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that allowed Russia to keep its fleet in Sevastopol. The agreement&rsquo;s since been extended, so the fleet is set to remain there until at least 2042.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Ignatius&rsquo; claim that Khrushchev&rsquo;s decision to give Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, we found literature to support that. Slate&rsquo;s Joshua Keating <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/02/25/separatism_in_ukraine_blame_nikita_khrushchev_for_ukraine_s_newest_crisis.html\"><u>offered up</u></a> possible reasons for the land transfer, including the 300th anniversary of Ukraine&rsquo;s merger with tsarist Russia and Khrushchev&rsquo;s ties to Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Khrushchev&rsquo;s gesture had unclear motives, it didn&rsquo;t seem like a problem for Russia at the time, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/02/27/283481587/crimea-a-gift-to-ukraine-becomes-a-political-flash-point\"><u>only garnering</u></a> a one-sentence write-up in the official Soviet newspaper. It became a bigger issue in the region once the Soviet Union collapsed decades later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the story of the Crimean Peninsula is long and complicated, to say the least. And there could be more news to come as war threatens Eastern Europe. Today, Crimea&rsquo;s residents are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/02/27/world/europe/ukraine-divisions-crimea.html\"><u>divided</u></a> on the issue of Russia&rsquo;s military intervention. Generally speaking, ethnic Russians support Russia&rsquo;s involvement in the region, while Tatars and Ukrainians express pro-Ukrainian sentiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ignatius said Crimea belonged to Russia until 1954, when Khrushchev gave the land to Ukraine, then a Soviet republic. Ignatius&rsquo; history lesson explains why Russians remain so intertwined with Crimea and why some Americans are worried that Russians will try to annex the peninsula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Ignatius&rsquo; statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Correction: About 60 percent of people living in Crimea identify themselves as Russian.
