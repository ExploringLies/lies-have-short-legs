The human smuggling and drug cartels are at a level of violence where  25,000 -- 23,000 Mexican citizens have been murdered in the last few  years, 5,000 already this year. There's a level of violence which has  increased to a significant degree, which makes the situation far  different than it was in 2007\" when the Senate last considered immigration reform. <br /><br />He added, \"But I invite the  president to come to the border, and he can see for himself the absolute  necessity of getting our border secure before more violence spills over  onto our side of the border... It is not the same as it was in 2007.  And the people deserve not to have our ranchers murdered, not to have a  deputy shot by a drug smuggler with an AK-47 in Pinal County. The  situation has dramatically changed, and the statistics absolutely back  that up.\" <br /><br />During the roundtable discussion on <em>This Week</em>, Hunt  told host Jake Tapper: \"I must say, John McCain, in his interview with  you, Jake, that was extraordinary to say that crime is up there. He's  talking about Mexico. Crime is down in Arizona. Every single academic  study that's been done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes.\" <br /><br />It  is unclear whether McCain was suggesting that crime in Arizona was up  because of illegal immigrants, but we were curious about Hunt's claim  that crime in Arizona -- a state that ranks 6th for the estimated  population of illegal immigrants -- was down.<br /><br />Because Hunt did  not specify the types of crime, we'll examine all types. <br /><br />We  checked the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports as well as data from Arizona's  Department of Public Safety and found Hunt is correct that crime is  down. <br /><br />From 2004 to 2008, data from Arizona's DPS shows a 23  percent drop in the overall crime rate, while the FBI's statistics on  Arizona show a 19 percent drop. Although the FBI has not released all  of the data on 2009, Arizona's statistics show the crime rate in 2009  dropped an additional 12 percent. <br /><br />\"Crime has been going  down, overall, in Arizona,\" said Tony LaRose, an associate professor of  criminology at the University of Tampa, but he noted it has been a national  trend for the past almost three decades.\"<br /><br />The trend holds even if  you only measure violent crime, which James Alan Fox, a professor of  criminology at Northeastern University, said is the type of crime  people think of when discussing crime and illegal immigrants. The  violent crime rate fell 11 percent from 2004 to 2008 in Arizona.<br /><br />Whether  or not Hunt was correctly interpreting McCain's comments is outside of  the scope of the claim, but he is right about Arizona crime going  down. So we rate Hunt's claim True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-07T14:46:38.473277", "ruling_date": "2010-07-07T17:12:21", "ruling_headline": "Bloomberg's Al Hunt says crime is down in Arizona", "ruling_headline_slug": "bloombergs-al-hunt-says-crime-down-arizona", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, state and federal stats show crime is down", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email Interview with Dr. Anthony LaRose, Associate Professor of  Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Tampa, July 6,  2010.<br /><br />Interview with Dr. James Alan Fox, The Lipman Family  Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern  University, July 6 2010.<br /><br />James Alan Fox, \"Fear of crime or of  illegal immigrants?\" Boston.com, June 22, 2010.<br /><br />Arizona  Department of Public Safety, \"<a href=\"http://www.azdps.gov/About/Reports/Crime_In_Arizona/\" target=\"_blank\">Crime in  Arizona Reports</a>,\" 2009-2004.<br /><br />FBI, \"<a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Uniform Crime Reports</a>,\"  2008-2003.<br />Jeffrey S.
