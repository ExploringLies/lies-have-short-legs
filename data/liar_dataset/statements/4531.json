Chris Christie has some advice for Washington, D.C.: follow New Jersey&rsquo;s lead.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican said in a speech last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., that the world doesn&rsquo;t view the United States as it once did, in part because of partisan bickering. But in New Jersey, he said, &quot;you have actually seen divided government that&rsquo;s working.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We compromised, on a bipartisan basis, to get results,&quot; Christie said Tuesday. &quot;How do we do this? How do we do it? Through leadership and compromise. Leadership and compromise is the only way you can balance two budgets with over $13 billion in deficits without raising taxes while protecting core services.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Christie mulls a possible bid for the White House, PolitiFact New Jersey looked at his tenure in the Garden State. We found his claim needs a few clarifications.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $13 billion in deficits includes a $2.2 billion mid-year deficit in the fiscal 2010 budget -- a spending plan approved by his predecessor -- and a $10.7 billion projected deficit for fiscal 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $10.7 billion figure was the state&rsquo;s projected structural deficit -- or the difference between the amount needed to maintain spending levels and fully fund every program mandated by state law and state revenues -- for fiscal 2011. The state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services calculated the structural deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie, in his fiscal 2012 budget proposal, dismissed the structural deficit as the &quot;old way of budgeting.&quot; We&rsquo;ll address that later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s tackle how Christie handled the $13 billion in deficits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie&rsquo;s plan to handle the fiscal 2010 deficit included &quot;375 line items of cuts, efficiencies and program eliminations,&quot; according to a February 2010 news release from the governor&rsquo;s office. Among those was a $475 million cut in aid to school districts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor tackled the projected $10.7 billion deficit for fiscal 2011 by reducing property tax rebates, school and municipal aid and skipping a more than $3 billion pension payment, among other measures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. So, Christie did balance both budgets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is a budget balanced when the state skips a required payment to the pension system?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s certainly not uncommon for governors to use the word &lsquo;balance&rsquo; imprecisely,&quot; said Bob Ward, deputy director of the New York-based Rockefeller Institute of Government. &quot;From a private-sector perspective, a budget that simply skips a required pension payment could not be described as balanced. In the context of state government budgets, the claim may be technically correct.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s cede that point to the governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Christie signed another spending plan this summer. What happened to the fiscal 2012 budget?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Office of Legislative Services projected the fiscal 2012 structural deficit at $10.5 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, in a February budget speech, the governor said the projected deficit &quot;assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday&rsquo;s New Jersey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, Christie said, &quot;the baseline is zero&quot; for budgeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the Office of Legislative Services, said &quot;that&rsquo;s not an illegitimate way to look at it,&quot; but the executive branch appears to be using two different methodologies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is, but it does seem like adding apples and oranges if they are using that calculation for one year and not another,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In his first year in office, the governor closed more than $13 billion in deficits created because past administrations and Legislatures approved costly programs without creating sustainable sources of long-term funding to pay for them. &nbsp;This created monstrous deficits,&quot; Andy Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, said in a written statement. &quot;We&rsquo;ve returned to a zero-based budgeting approach that starts on the assumption that we spend within our means and budget based on realistic and sustainable revenues. &nbsp;Except in theoretical terms, that means there are no longer any deficits to discuss.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s tackle Christie&rsquo;s other point that he didn&rsquo;t raise taxes. PolitiFact New Jersey previously found that while rates for the state&rsquo;s three major taxes have remained the same, several experts said at least one of three tax credits programs reduced in fiscal 2011 could represent a tax hike.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor said his administration balanced &quot;two budgets with over $13 billion in deficits without raising taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeveral experts said cuts to tax credit programs could represent a tax hike.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd while Christie is technically correct that he balanced two budgets with $13 billion in deficits, that figure includes a projected structural deficit. And the governor has since dismissed structural deficits as &quot;the old way of budgeting.&quot; He can&rsquo;t have it one way one year and then change it the next year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the governor&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/politifact_new_jersey_christie_5.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-30T18:52:58.349103", "ruling_date": "2011-10-02T09:28:29", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims he balanced two budgets while facing $13 billion in deficits and didn\u2019t raise taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-he-balanced-two-budgets-whil", "ruling_link_text": "What about this year's deficit?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://video-embed.nj.com/services/player/bcpid619329501001?bctid=1185953019001\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.32398982931135145\">Gov.
