A lot has been happening in this three-week period. I wish I&#39;d had more of my staff on board, but we&#39;re still waiting for confirmation for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;Much has been done. Much needs to be done. But I did and have done as I promised. I have met with senior officials shortly after arriving here. We evaluated the rules of ethics and recusal. I have considered the issues at stake. &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just. Therefore, I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline on the Conservative Patriot blog claimed Sessions was &quot;caught colluding with Obama.&quot; But there is no evidence of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-23T12:26:33.305013", "ruling_date": "2018-05-23T13:02:17", "ruling_headline": "Website falsely claims Jeff Sessions 'caught colluding with Obama'", "ruling_headline_slug": "false-claim-jeff-sessions-caught-collud", "ruling_link_text": "No evidence", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Theconspatriot.com, Jeff Sessions Caught Colluding with Obama, April 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Justice Department, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-statement-recusal\">Attorney General Sessions Statement on Recusal</a>, March 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?424859-1/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-recuses-russia-trump-campaign-investigations&amp;start=164\">Attorney General Jeff Sessions News Conference</a>, March 2, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Jeff Sessions Caught Colluding with Obama&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-04-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
