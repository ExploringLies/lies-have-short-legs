Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez said so during the <a href=\"http://cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4418262\"><u>Feb. 4, 2014, edition</u></a> of MSNBC&rsquo;s <em>Morning Joe</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Perez said, &quot;just came out with their data on union membership. &hellip; If you have a union job, you&#39;re making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you&#39;re making $750 a week. So collective bargaining is a big part of how this middle class grew in America and it continues to be an important part of who we are as Americans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We located the report Perez was talking about. In <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t02.htm\"><u>this table</u></a>, BLS summarizes median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers in 2012 and 2013 by whether they are in a union or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The table shows that the median weekly earnings for union members in 2013 was $950, compared to $750 for non-union workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Perez is basically right, with one exception. He should have referred to <em>median </em>earnings, rather than average earnings. A median takes the exact middle value from a list that&rsquo;s ordered from biggest to smallest, rather than taking the sum of all earnings and dividing it by the number of people. The two calculations usually aren&rsquo;t the same; a median is less likely to be skewed by very small or very large values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s worth pointing out a few other bits of context, none of which make Perez&rsquo;s claim less accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>This is an overall median; the ratios by occupation differ</strong>. In some sectors, being a union member doesn&rsquo;t matter much, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t04.htm\"><u>BLS found</u></a>. In several sectors -- including &quot;management, professional, and related occupations,&quot; &quot;financial activities,&quot; &quot;professional and technical services,&quot; &quot;sales and related occupations,&quot; &quot;mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction,&quot; and the federal government -- non-union workers actually earn modestly more than union members do. And union members earn only marginally more than non-union workers in such fields as &quot;telecommunications&quot; and &quot;arts, entertainment, and recreation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the biggest gaps come in fields such as &quot;protective service occupations&quot; (a difference of $459 a week) and &quot;construction&quot; (a difference of $383 a week). Protective service occupations includes correctional officers, police, firefighters, animal control workers, lifeguards, and security guards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unions do more to raise the wages of workers with less-than-average education than they do to boost the wages of those with better-than-average education,&quot; said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. &quot;Unionized Ph.D.s do not gain as much from being in a union as high school dropouts, though even unionized Ph.D.s may enjoy a bit better job security and receive bigger helpings of health and retirement benefits than their non-union counterparts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>If you include fringe benefits, the difference between union members and non-union workers grows</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2013/ted_20130513.htm\"><u>BLS data from 2011</u></a>, workers&rsquo; pay plus benefts for a 40-hour week was $1,508 for a union employee and $1,083 for a non-union worker. That&rsquo;s a gap of $425 -- more than double the gap in the figures cited by Perez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unions are typically more successful in getting good fringe benefits &ndash; especially health benefits, sickness pay, and retirement benefits &ndash; than in raising workers&rsquo; money wages,&quot; Burtless said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez said. &quot;If you have a union job, you&#39;re making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you&#39;re making $750 a week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His figures are correct, but with an asterisk -- Perez should have specified &quot;median&quot; when he said &quot;average.&quot; In general, though, his overall point is backed up by the data. We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-07T13:40:53.110273", "ruling_date": "2014-02-07T14:57:32", "ruling_headline": "Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says union members earn $200 more a week than those not in unions", "ruling_headline_slug": "labor-secretary-thomas-perez-says-union-members-ea", "ruling_link_text": "Accurate except for one word", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Tom Perez, <a href=\"http://cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4418262\"><u>interview</u></a> with MSNBC&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/white-house-pushes-to-raise-minimum-wage-136938051731\"><em>Morning Joe</em></a>, Feb. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t04.htm\"><u>Table 4.
