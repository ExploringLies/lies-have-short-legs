What&rsquo;s the likelihood that the remaining 4.8 million Indiana adults each constitute their own household?</p>\r\n<p>Not likely at all.</p>\r\n<p>When we asked the Indiana Department of Revenue how many tax returns are filed annually in the state, they said the number is around 3.2 million, and that includes both joint filers and individuals.</p>\r\n<p>So clearly Obama was wrong. A White House official confirmed for us that it was a goof, pure and simple. A staffer mistakenly used the number of households in Illinois in Obama's speech, 4.8 million, instead of Indiana, which is 2.4 million.</p>\r\n<p>So there aren't as many Hoosier households as Obama claimed, and he earns a False on the Truth-O-Meter.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:41.488570", "ruling_date": "2009-08-05T17:44:11", "ruling_headline": "Obama flubs number of Indiana households getting tax break during speech", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-flubs-number-households-indiana-during-speec", "ruling_link_text": "The president got his \"I\" states mixed up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House,  <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-the-Economy-in-Wakarusa-Indiana/\" target=\"_blank\"> President Obama's Remarks in Wakarusa, Ind., </a> Aug. 5, 2009  <br /> <br /> Census Bureau,  <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/18000.html\" target=\"_blank\"> state population data </a> , accessed Aug. 5, 2009  <br /> <br /> Table in recovery.gov  <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/?q=content/making-work-pay&amp;mode=table\" target=\"_blank\"> Web site </a> , accessed Aug. 5, 2009  <br /> <br /> Interview with Stephanie McFarland, spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Revenue, Aug. 5, 2009</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Stimulus tax cuts \"began showing up in paychecks of 4.8 million Indiana households about three months ago.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a speech in Wakarusa, Ind.", "statement_date": "2009-08-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 150, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/150/", "subject": "Stimulus", "subject_slug": "stimulus", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
