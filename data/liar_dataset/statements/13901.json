It&rsquo;s the best source of data in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We confined our review to graduation rates for African-American and Hispanic students because they make up most of the minority students in Beloit. Black students were 26 percent of the total enrollment there in 2006-&rsquo;07, Holtz&rsquo;s first year in the district. Hispanics made up 13 percent of the student body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the graduation rates from his time in Beloit, spanning three school years:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For African Americans:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2006-&rsquo;07: 64 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2007-&rsquo;08: 76 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2008-09: 85 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Hispanics:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2006-&rsquo;07: 74 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2007-&rsquo;08: 75 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2008-&rsquo;09: 84 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figures back up the part of Holtz&rsquo;s claim about rates climbing over 80 percent on his watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about the contention that Beloit&rsquo;s graduation rates started out below those of minority students in Milwaukee and Madison?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that time, 2006-&rsquo;07, Beloit&rsquo;s rate for black students was slightly lower than in Milwaukee, but slightly above Madison&rsquo;s rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s a mixed bag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Hispanic students, the graduation rate in Beloit was higher than in either of those two districts in Holtz&rsquo;s first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you look back to the year before he arrived, Beloit&rsquo;s graduation rate for Hispanic students was significantly lower than the rates in Milwaukee or Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, some support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For context, the graduation rate for white students in Beloit was considerably higher than for black students, but the gap between the groups narrowed dramatically by Holtz&rsquo;s third year. That&rsquo;s because while the rate for whites improved (topping Milwaukee and Madison), the rate for black students rose more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is another aspect to Holtz&rsquo;s claim -- to what degree did his policies influence the rate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specific policy changes he helped enact fueled the progress, Holtz claims, pointing to improvements in safety and discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts, and Holtz, acknowledge that students, teachers, parents, elected officials and community members all have to play a role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That muddies the water on claiming credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz says that when he ran the Beloit school district, &quot;Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rates rose significantly and topped 80 percent both for black students and Hispanic students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the picture upon his arrival was not quite as bleak as Holtz claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-23T17:00:51.491038", "ruling_date": "2017-03-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lowell Holtz says graduation rates soared for minority students when he ran the Beloit schools", "ruling_headline_slug": "lowell-holtz-says-graduation-rates-soared-minority", "ruling_link_text": "The black-white graduation gap narrowed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Lowell Holtz <a href=\"http://www.kidservative.org/improve-discipline-safety-performance-will-follow/\">campaign blog post</a>, March 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Charles Sanger, president, CS Communications, spokesman for Holtz campaign, March 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Thomas McCarthy, communications director, Department of Public Instruction, March 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WINSS historical data, graduation rates, accessed through <a href=\"https://dpi.wi.gov/wisedash/download-files/type?field_wisedash_upload_type_value=WINSS+Historical+Data+Files&amp;field_wisedash_data_view_value=Certified\">Department of Public Instruction website</a>, March 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beloit Daily News, <a href=\"https://dpi.wi.gov/wisedash/download-files/type?field_wisedash_upload_type_value=WINSS+Historical+Data+Files&amp;field_wisedash_data_view_value=Certified\">&quot;Ex Beloit Superintendent Will Run for State Position,&quot;</a> July 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lowell-holtz-bbb99120/\">LinkedIn site</a>, Lowell Holtz, accessed March 21, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Candidate for State Superintendent of Schools", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Lowell", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 3837, "last_name": "Holtz", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "lowell-holtz", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT__Holtz.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3837/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.kidservative.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%&quot; when I was Beloit school superintendent.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign blog post", "statement_date": "2017-03-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
