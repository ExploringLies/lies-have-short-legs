Bush: &quot;If you don&rsquo;t have a seat at the table, you&rsquo;re likely on the menu.&quot; And then he said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>When you look at the floor of Congress, it&rsquo;s especially telling. On the Democratic side of the room, you&rsquo;ve got men and women of all different races. On the other side, you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so. It&rsquo;s such a contrast. That&rsquo;s not representative of the country. We really need to get people making sure that everyone has a voice.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found is Pocan is largely on target, in that Democrats are more diverse, although there are more than older white men among Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gender diversity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll tackle Pocan&rsquo;s claim in three parts. We base our analysis primarily on <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44762.pdf\">a March 2017 report</a> on the current makeup of the House and Senate by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which provides policy and legal analysis for Congress. Taking into account vacancies and independents, it lists 289 Republicans and 239 Democrats among the 535 voting members of the two chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part of Pocan&rsquo;s claim is about women. The report shows that Democrats, even though they are outnumbered by Republicans, have three times more women in the two chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Democratic women</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Republican women</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>78</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>26</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">That being said, the 78 Democratic women represent about one-third of all Democrats in Congress. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/\">That&rsquo;s less</a> representative of the population as a whole, which is roughly half female.
