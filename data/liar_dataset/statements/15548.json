(Sorry if you were hoping for a free sugar rush.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Dunkin&#39; Donuts is providing a free \u1e0cozen Doughnut Box to everyone! to celebrate 68th Anniversary!&quot; a <a href=\"http://dunkin-usa.org/?ZCoc7yi\">website</a> Dunkin USA announces, encouraging its readers to partake in a short survey in exchange for the donuts. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious about whether we could truly take this opportunity to get some free donuts from Dunkin&rsquo;, so we took the survey to see what would happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey asks its participants three questions. The first is whether the participant has ever visited Dunkin&rsquo;, the second about why the participant prefers Dunkin&rsquo;, and the third and final question asks whether the survey-taker is satisfied by Dunkin&rsquo;s services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we completed the survey, the website asked us to share the page on Facebook, comment &quot;Thanks for my coupon,&quot; and click &quot;Like.&quot; We followed all these instructions, but were not presented with a coupon for the donuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The link resembles past offers that have also turned out to be scams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We only have 332 Boxes remaining so hurry up!&quot; the Dunkin&rsquo; offer claims. A <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/14/delta-flyinginfo/delta-targeted-online-free-airline-ticket-scam/\">previous scam </a>targeting Delta also featured similar language as well as the number 332: &quot;Congratulations! You have been selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Delta Airline Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!&quot; the website Delta-Flying.info stated. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, links supposedly offering their visitors coupons for free Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts in celebration of the company&rsquo;s 67th anniversary have <a href=\"http://time.com/money/5168118/dunkin-donuts-fake-coupon-free-doughnuts/\">surfaced in the past</a>. Snopes debunked a previous version of the scam that was widely circulated in December 2017. Michelle King, a spokeswoman for Dunkin&rsquo; Brands Group Inc., told the website <a href=\"https://www.retailmenot.com/blog/dunkin-donuts-fake-coupon.html\">Retailmenot.com</a> that the offer is not affiliated with Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that isn&rsquo;t enough, the survey is rife with grammatical and spelling errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey asks, &quot;Have you ever visited at Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts?&quot; when it would be grammatically correct to ask &quot;Have you ever visited Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the answer selections available for the survey&rsquo;s question &quot;You prefer Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts because of?&quot; are &quot;It&rsquo;s Cheapness,&quot; &quot;It&rsquo;s Environment,&quot; and &quot;Don&rsquo;t Know,&quot; even though it would be correct to use &quot;Its&quot; rather than &quot;It&rsquo;s.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, while the survey touts a &quot;free Dozen Doughnut Box,&quot; Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts doesn&rsquo;t use that spelling of the sweet treat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that an official Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts offer would contain so many errors. We reached out to Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts but did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website&rsquo;s claim that visitors will receive a coupon for a free dozen of donuts in exchange for completing a survey is too good to be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-28T15:12:26.465302", "ruling_date": "2018-06-29T10:08:52", "ruling_headline": "Free Dunkin\u2019 Donuts online offer is a scam ", "ruling_headline_slug": "free-dunkin-donuts-online-offer-scam", "ruling_link_text": "Donut believe this offer", "ruling_state": "Illinois", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://dunkin-usa.org/?ZCoc7yi\">http://dunkin-usa.org/?ZCoc7yi</a>, Accessed June 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money, &quot;<a href=\"http://time.com/money/5168118/dunkin-donuts-fake-coupon-free-doughnuts/\">Beware of This Dunkin&#39; Donuts Coupon Floating Around Offering Free Doughnuts,</a>&quot; February 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/14/delta-flyinginfo/delta-targeted-online-free-airline-ticket-scam/\">Delta targeted in online free airline ticket scam,</a>&quot; March 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dunkin-donuts-coupon-hoax/\">Dunkin&rsquo; &lsquo;Free Box of Donuts&rsquo; Coupon Scam,</a>&quot; December 7, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Say &quot;Dunkin&#39; Donuts is providing a free \u1e0cozen Doughnut Box to everyone! to celebrate 68th Anniversary!&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-06-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
