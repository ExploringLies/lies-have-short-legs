In a recent ad in the Catholic Sentinel, the group tells readers that making a difference (i.e. donating) is &quot;free&quot; and &quot;easy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Announcing an amazing no-cost way to fight abortion,&quot; the ad says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe love seeing &quot;free&quot; and &quot;no cost.&quot; Mostly in conjunction with sales, but also here because it&rsquo;s a tell-tale sign of a good fact check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad urges people &quot;to use some of your taxes to help prevent abortion&quot; and says the group uses the money &quot;to help elect pro-life candidates in Oregon.&quot; According to the ad, individual Oregonians can make a $50 political donation ($100 for couples) to Oregon Right to Life and get a tax credit back in the very same amount. Amazing! But is it true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did some googling and found ourselves on the Oregon Department of Revenue&rsquo;s website. Lo and behold, there it was, under a list of possible tax credits: &quot;Political contributions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Oregon law allows a tax credit for political contributions,&quot; according to the site.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt makes sense, we suppose, why wouldn&rsquo;t politicians pass a tax break that has the potential to help them?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere are the details: Under Oregon tax law, an individual can donate up to $50 (again, $100 for a couple jointly filing) to a candidate or their principal campaign committee, a political action committee or a political party (national, state or local) and claim an equal credit on their return.
