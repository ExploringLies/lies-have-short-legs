That doesn&rsquo;t mean they speak a foreign language exclusively at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on the percentage of &quot;homes&quot; where a foreign language is spoken is harder to find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after crunching some 2014 census figures, <a href=\"http://cis.org/Camarota\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Steven Camarota</u></a>, director of research for the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told us that 48.3 percent of households in California &quot;have at least one person who speaks a language other than English at home.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would call it half,&quot; Camarota said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that foreign language households are often undercounted during census surveys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More to the story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buchanan&rsquo;s statement is not far from the truth, when examining the numbers alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he ignores figures about how many Californians speak English proficiently. Nineteen percent in the state report having limited English language skills, the <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/limited-english-proficient-population-united-states#Distribution%20by%20State\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>highest share of any state</u></a> in the nation, followed by 14 percent in Texas and 13 percent in New York, according to the Migration Policy Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means, however, that more than 80 percent of Californians report having a stronger set of English language skills, or speaking the language &quot;very well.&quot;<em> </em>Proficiency levels offer a more accurate look at how California and its many immigrants are adopting the country&rsquo;s primary language, said <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/bio.asp?i=130\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Laura Hill</u></a>, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, who studies immigrant populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buchanan&rsquo;s claim about foreign language speakers&nbsp;includes many who Hill said &quot;could be completely fluent in Spanish and English or English and Vietnamese. They could have really high levels of English fluency.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hill added that &quot;If you&rsquo;re trying to make a point about immigrant integration, you&rsquo;re going to be more interested in understanding not how many people speak a different language, but how many don&rsquo;t speak English very well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Buchanan to explain his statement, his representative sent us links to <a href=\"http://la.curbed.com/2015/11/4/9904020/los-angeles-languages\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news articles</u></a> that say more than half of Los Angeles, but not California as a whole, speaks a foreign language at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buchanan made two runs for the Republican presidential nomination, coming up short in 1992 and 1996. He also ran a failed bid for president in 2000 as a Reform Party candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a conversation on NPR, Pat Buchanan said &quot;In half the homes in California, people speak a language other than English in their own homes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the numbers alone, he&rsquo;s close to correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he fails to note that many of those who speak a foreign language at home also are fluent in English. He also omits the fact that only 19 percent of Californians, not half, are considered limited English speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buchanan&rsquo;s statement contains some element of truth, but in the context of his conversation, it wrongly implies that half the state does not speak English. It ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>CORRECTION: This&nbsp;fact check has been corrected to show that English is the primary language in the United States.
