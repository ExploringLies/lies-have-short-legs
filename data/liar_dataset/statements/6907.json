Paul Ryan of Wisconsin challenged and chided each other&rsquo;s proposals, particularly on the hot-button issue of Medicare reform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan is the author of a House budget proposal that calls for substantial changes to the government health care program for seniors, including an eventual shift to &quot;premium support&quot; which beneficiaries could use to purchase private insurance. Romney has embraced it as a means of introducing choice and competition into Medicare. Democrats, including Biden and President Barack Obama, say it will end up costing seniors more. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/12/transcript-vice-presidential-debate/\">Oct. 11 debate</a>, Ryan defended the plan as having bipartisan support:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is a plan that&#39;s bipartisan. It&#39;s a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat<br />\r\n\tsenator from Oregon,&quot; said Ryan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&#39;s not one Democrat who endorses it,&quot; Biden interjected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon,&quot; Ryan answered amid some cross-talk.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And he said he does no longer support (it),&quot; Biden insisted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedicare -- complex, polarizing and highly political because of the huge voting bloc of seniors who cherish it -- is center stage in the campaign. We decided to check who&rsquo;s right about across-aisle-support for the Republican plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The Ryan budgets</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan, the Republican House budget chairman, first unveiled a <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111hconres34\">budget blueprint</a> in early 2011 that would convert Medicare to the premium support model. It also raised the program&rsquo;s eligibility age from 65 to 67, called for a repeal of Obamacare and reined in other spending to reduce the federal deficit. It <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll277.xml\">passed the House</a> on April 15, 2011, but the Democrat-controlled Senate <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00077\">rejected it</a> a month later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tArguments over Medicare hit a fever pitch that year, with Democrats accusing Republicans of voting to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/\">end Medicare</a>.&quot; Then, in December, the hope of compromise peeked through the partisan clouds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., joined together and offered a compromise on Medicare reform ideas. Their ideas were contained in a <a href=\"http://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/discussion-paper-guaranteed-choices-to-strengthen-medicare-and-health-security-for-all-bipartisan-options-for-the-future\">white paper</a> -- never taking the form of legislation -- and were branded as marrying the best proposals from each side.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe main difference from Ryan&rsquo;s original plan: The new proposal left in place traditional Medicare for those who wanted it, while still offering premium support to buy private policies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&#39;s a lot to work with here in terms of trying to find common ground,&quot; Wyden said at the time, according to the <em>Washington Post</em>. &quot;This doesn&#39;t end Medicare as we know it. People can go to bed knowing that traditional Medicare will be there for them for all time.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said the plan presented &quot;the opportunity for progressives and conservatives to come together and address the real challenges&quot; of the federal entitlement program: rising health costs and an aging population.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats were unequivocal in their criticism. The White House returned to the old party line, saying the plan would &quot;end Medicare as we know it.&quot; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats said it would essentially kill Medicare. Republicans, who sensed a political opportunity in the defection of Wyden, offered more open-minded reactions. Newt Gingrich, who called Ryan&#39;s original plan &quot;right-wing social engineering,&quot; praised the Ryan-Wyden deal as &quot;a major breakthrough.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWyden, a senator since 1996, is known as policy-driven and liberal-minded, but also a true and rare compromiser. He told the <em>Oregonian </em>newspaper in March 2012 that he was not being punished by Democratic leaders for partnering with Ryan, saying his biggest adversaries were special interests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When you deal with a big issue where there are a lot of passions, you expect this,&quot; he said then. &quot;I made the judgment that I couldn&#39;t just sit by and talk about business as usual for this program that, for me, has been sacred for three decades.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe also found himself fending off suggestions by Romney that he abetted the Republicans&rsquo; Medicare plan. Wyden, according to the <em>Oregonian</em>, said he&#39;d never spoken to Romney. He posted an explanation in the <em>Huffington Post</em> titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/preserving-the-medicare-guarantee-why-ive-been-working-with-paul-ryan\">Preserving the Medicare Guarantee: Why I&#39;ve Been Working with Paul Ryan</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe used personal anecdotes to explain his motivation to fight for seniors and warned that serious reform was needed to preserve the &quot;guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the meantime, Ryan unveiled his <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:hc112:\">budget proposal for 2013</a>. It contained many of the same hallmarks as its predecessor: reduced federal spending, repeal of Obamacare. Only this one incorporated the Ryan-Wyden plan for Medicare, with premium support and the traditional option.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWyden said he was wary of the wider proposal, citing a lower limit for Medicare&#39;s spending growth and a full repeal of the health care overhaul. He also warned his Medicare white paper should not be used to anoint the whole Ryan budget as having bipartisan support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Any person on the right who says that this is about cover -- that person is hurting senior citizens,&quot; Wyden said in a March 20 story in <em>Congressional Quarterly Today</em>. &quot;I say that explicitly because they&#39;re making it tougher to get a bipartisan agreement in the future.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Partners no more</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the spring of 2012 showed the Ryan-Wyden romance fading, late summer was the break-up. On Aug. 11, 2012, Ryan was tapped as Romney&rsquo;s running mate, and within days, Romney was hailing his VP nominee&rsquo;s Medicare plan as bipartisan -- and naming Wyden.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Paul Ryan and Sen. Wyden said, &#39;No, we need to restore, retain and protect Medicare,&#39; &quot; Romney said at a campaign stop in Virginia. &quot;That&#39;s what our party will do.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Post </em>wrote that Wyden was &quot;apparently displeased about his sudden prominence as a validator of the Republican ticket.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Gov. Romney is talking nonsense,&quot; Wyden told reporters, according to the <em>Post</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe explained in detail his two main objections to Romney&rsquo;s proposals <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/14/sen-wyden-romneys-plan-hurts-the-poorest-and-most-vulnerable-seniors/\">in an interview with Ezra Klein</a>, who writes the <em>Post&rsquo;s</em> Wonk Blog. Repealing Obamacare, he said, would undo changes to Medicare that are necessary to transition to premium support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecondly, Romney has proposed turning Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and disabled, into a block grant to the states and rein in spending. That change, Wyden said, &quot;would do enormous harm to those people whose protection was at the center of the white paper.&quot; Romney&rsquo;s approach to Medicaid &quot;completely pulls the rug out from under the poorest and most vulnerable seniors,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf any doubt remained following the vice presidential debate on Oct. 11 about Wyden&rsquo;s position on the Republican Medicare plan, Wyden addressed it the same night on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wyden/posts/10151123887502858\">his Facebook page</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Republican ticket knows that neither I, nor any other Democrat, would support these policies. The Romney/Ryan plan on Medicare is further proof that Mitt Romney is singularly unfit to end gridlock and bring bipartisan solutions to Washington,&quot; he wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBiden said &quot;there&rsquo;s not one Democrat who endorses&quot; the Republican proposal to fundamentally restructure Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat hasn&rsquo;t always been the case. Last year, Wyden and Ryan put their heads together and offered a compromise proposal for the future of Medicare. But that bipartisan bond began to crack months ago when the Wisconsin congressman put forth a second budget with provisions Wyden opposed. Their partnership dissolved in August, after Ryan joined the Romney ticket, and Wyden made a point of talking up the differences between his and the Republicans&rsquo; ideas for Medicare, not the similarities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWyden was the only Democrat to endorse Ryan&rsquo;s idea of premium support in Medicare, and his approval has clearly been revoked.
