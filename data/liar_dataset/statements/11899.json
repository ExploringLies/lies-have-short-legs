Bernie Sanders says by addressing economic inequality, he would also correct racial injustices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders railed against Wall Street in his response to a question about race relations in the Feb. 11 Democratic debate in Milwaukee, Wis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Turns out that the African-American community and Latino community were hit especially hard,&quot; Sanders <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/11/transcript-the-democratic-debate-in-milwaukee-annotated/\">said</a>. &quot;As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That claim stood out to us. Is it true that black wealth was slashed so dramatically as a result of the financial crisis?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders understood correctly. His campaign referred us to a <a href=\"http://nlihc.org/article/report-shows-african-americans-lost-half-their-wealth-due-housing-crisis-and-unemployment\">2013 report</a> from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;According to the report, African-Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling homeownership rates and loss of jobs,&quot; it reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report refers to Pew Research Center <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2011/07/SDT-Wealth-Report_7-26-11_FINAL.pdf\">data</a> from 2011 that shows the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from $12,124 in 2005 to $5,677 in 2009. Technically, this loss fits the timeline of the housing crisis in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/\">2014 Pew report</a> more closely follows the financial crisis of 2007. According to that report, median net worth of the black household decreased from $19,200 in 2007 to $11,000 in 2013 (in 2013 dollars). That&rsquo;s a loss of 43 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the two economic crises are intertwined, and both Pew reports note that the housing bubble and the recession that followed &quot;took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites.&quot; Here&rsquo;s a chart from the Pew Center that demonstrates this: <img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hC-TUqz5vul6_i5mGzDXFOCbhEXQ2lXdmJ5diaRgyqSzYtHq3BY3tUBGI2VyrMf_f4yzX043JlXyBzd2pH1rKz8k-8zqJNL44OyjtJ3K60SAr5r7_N0gDnlT7lrTCIOdNTqVD16w\" style=\"border:none; height:392px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Census Bureau <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bcNDlN75n31aPP33gsiiGzYytm6tMxARNsp0MfgqRhI/edit#gid=0\">data</a> corroborates, if not magnifies, this point: Black median net worth decreased 61 percent from 2005 to 2009. Whites, in contrast, lost 21 percent of their wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said, &quot;The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates for how much wealth blacks lost from 2005 to 2009 &mdash; as a result of the housing bubble &mdash; range from 53 percent to 61 percent. African-American net worth plummeted 43 percent from 2007 to 2013 &mdash; as a result of the financial crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the two financial crises are inseparable, we won&rsquo;t quibble with Sanders&rsquo; timeline. We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-11T22:55:57.540156", "ruling_date": "2016-02-11T22:54:40", "ruling_headline": "Sanders: African-Americans lost half their wealth because of Wall Street collapse", "ruling_headline_slug": "sanders-african-american-lost-half-their-wealth-be", "ruling_link_text": "Minorities were hit harder", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/11/transcript-the-democratic-debate-in-milwaukee-annotated/\">Transcript: The Democratic debate in Milwaukee, annotated</a>,&quot; Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Warren Gunnels, policy director for Bernie Sanders, Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Association of Real Estate Brokers, &quot;<a href=\"http://nlihc.org/article/report-shows-african-americans-lost-half-their-wealth-due-housing-crisis-and-unemployment\">State of Housing in Black America</a>,&quot; Aug. 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2011/07/SDT-Wealth-Report_7-26-11_FINAL.pdf\">Wealth Gaps Rise to Record Highs Between Whites, Blacks and Hispanics</a>,&quot; July 26, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/\">Wealth inequality has widened along racial, ethnic lines since end of Great Recession</a>,&quot; Dec. 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/people/wealth/data/dtables.html\">Detailed tables on wealth and asset ownership</a> 2005 to 2011, accessed Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Atlantic</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/black-recession-housing-race/396725/\">The Recession&#39;s Racial Slant</a>,&quot; Jun. 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNNMoney, &quot;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/12/news/economy/wealth-by-race-pew/\\\">Whites get wealthier, while Blacks and Hispanics lag further behind</a>,&quot; Dec. 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/24/donna-brazile/brazile-said-53-percent-black-wealth-has-disappear/\">Brazile said 53 percent of black wealth has disappeared in the downturn</a>,&quot; Aug. 24, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Bernie", "half_true_count": 28, "home_state": "Vermont", "id": 218, "last_name": "Sanders", "mostly_true_count": 46, "name_slug": "bernie-sanders", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "edition": "Vermont", "edition_slug": "vermont", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 65, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "Vermont Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/65/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/218/", "total_count": 129, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://sanders.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments during the PBS Democratic debate", "statement_date": "2016-02-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 130, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/130/", "subject": "Diversity", "subject_slug": "diversity", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 153, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/153/", "subject": "Financial Regulation", "subject_slug": "financial-regulation", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
