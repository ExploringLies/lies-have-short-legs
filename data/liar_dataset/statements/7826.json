Pat Robertson on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; that some of the roughly 4,500 federal crimes now on the books need to be eliminated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThen the Wisconsin Republican illustrated his point with this claim:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;I think the FBI has got much better things to do, for example, than investigate an 11-year-old girl that ended up having to pay a $500 criminal fine because she found an injured woodpecker and put it in a cage to make sure that the bird was OK and that violated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat got high marks on our curiosity meter.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut how does Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s claim fare on the Truth-O-Meter?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Woodpecker case</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe found news accounts and a <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/northeast/le/stories/virginiawoodpecker.html\">news release</a> from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service describing the following incident:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOn June 13, 2011, Skylar Capo, 11, rescued a baby woodpecker that she believed was about to be eaten by the family cat at her dad&rsquo;s home near Fredricksburg, Va.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSkylar&rsquo;s mom, Alison Capo, agreed to let Skylar take the bird to their home for a day or two to make sure it was OK.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOn the way home, the family stopped at a Lowe&#39;s store, bringing the bird with them in a cage to spare it from the heat in the car.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo, part of Sensenbrenner&#39;s claim is accurate: The girl took a woodpecker she thought might be injured and put it in a cage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBack to the story.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInside the store, a woman confronted the Capos, saying she was from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and that it was against the law to take or transport a woodpecker.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCapo said that as soon as she and her daughter returned home, they released the bird and reported the release to the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut two weeks later, on June 27, 2011, the same woman from the Lowe&#39;s store, accompanied by a state trooper, arrived at the Capos&rsquo; home. She had already drafted a citation for violation of the federal <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/migtrea.html\">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a>, which protects woodpeckers and <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/mbtandx.html\">numerous other birds</a>. <a href=\"http://alaska.fws.gov/ambcc/ambcc/treaty_act.htm\">Violation</a> of the act is a misdemeanor and carries a fine, up six months in jail, or both.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAfter the visit, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the agent determined no further action was necessary; and the next day, she canceled the citation she had drafted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSeveral weeks later, however, Capo received a letter of violation, notifying her of a $535 fine, the possible jail time and a date to appear in federal court.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut no fine was ever paid. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued an <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/news/blog/index.cfm/2011/8/2/Service-Apologizes-for-Citation#.Tjh4ARIflj8.twitter\">apology</a>, saying the citation had been processed &quot;unintentionally&quot; and should never have been issued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tArguing that the federal criminal code should be downsized, Sensenbrenner said an 11-year-old girl was investigated by the FBI and had to pay a $500 federal criminal fine &quot;because she found an injured woodpecker and put it in a cage to make sure that the bird was OK.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-49ff0778-d857-2df8-793c-23b54f922106\">\r\n\tThe FBI didn&rsquo;t investigate the girl, the citation issued was withdrawn and no fine was paid.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe rate Sensenbrenner&#39;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-24T17:02:19.111900", "ruling_date": "2013-05-28T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Girl had to pay $500 federal criminal fine for rescuing woodpecker, Rep.
