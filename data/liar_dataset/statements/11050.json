So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;In May 1991, Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1991/roll083.xml\">against</a>&nbsp;a version that mandated a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/7\">seven-day waiting period</a> for background checks, but the bill passed in the House. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The Senate decreased the waiting period to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/1241\">five days</a> and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1991/roll443.xml\">against</a> that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn&rsquo;t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1025/text/rh\">reinstated the five day waiting period</a>. In November 1993, Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll564.xml\">against</a> that version but <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll559.xml\">for</a> an amendment imposing an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/103rd-congress/house-amendment/390\">instant background check</a> instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn&rsquo;t exist at the time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;He also voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll560.xml\">against</a> an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll561.xml\">for</a> an amendment giving those denied a gun <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/103rd-congress/house-amendment/389\">the right to know why</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- &nbsp;an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1025\">interim five-day waiting period</a> while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll614.xml\">against</a> it. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Sanders&#39; campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders&rsquo; reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He wasn&#39;t opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,&quot; Weaver&nbsp;said. &quot;He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 1991, Sanders&rsquo; then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Bernie&rsquo;s response is that he doesn&rsquo;t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,&quot; Pollina <a href=\"http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/whos-afraid-of-the-nra-vermonts-congressmen-thats-who/Content?oid=2435066\">said</a>. &quot;It&rsquo;s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders&rsquo; own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,&quot; explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. &quot;He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents&rsquo; preferences so does not make gun control a priority.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line &ndash; and angering both sides through the years,&quot; said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. &quot;Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders&rsquo; 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00394\">against</a> the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are <a

Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts noted Sanders&rsquo; votes were representative of Vermont&rsquo;s gun owners and gun laws.
