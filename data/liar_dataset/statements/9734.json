Paul voted against the budget deals that led to the shutdown, but <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/19/rand-paul-shutdown-was-dumb-idea-but-id-vote-the-same-way-again/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>he said</u></a> he thought shutting down the government was a &quot;bad idea.&quot; And he carried the same position in Iowa this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open,&quot; Paul said. &quot;You know your&nbsp;government&rsquo;s dysfunctional if it costs more to shut it down than to keep it open, because we paid all these people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming from someone like Paul, who has&nbsp;been known to oppose government spending, that comment intrigued us. (We noticed it when Yahoo! News political reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moody/status/496717455398809603\">Chris Moody</a>, who was there, tweeted it out.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The economics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul&rsquo;s comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted just over two weeks from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During those two weeks, up to 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, national parks shut their doors, government-funded scientific research halted, and various health and safety inspections -- out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration -- &nbsp;were put on hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does not spending money come at a cost?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sen. Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called &#39;shutdown,&#39;&quot; a spokesman told us. &quot;Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn&#39;t work and government had to pay interest on late payments.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/reports/impacts-and-costs-of-october-2013-federal-government-shutdown-report.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Office of Management and Budget</u></a>, which reports directly to the president. (Paul&rsquo;s spokesman pointed us to this <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/us/politics/white-house-puts-price-on-government-shutdown.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New York Times</u></a></em><em> </em>article about the White House report as evidence.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a few highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>$2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending);</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>$500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>$11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn&rsquo;t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy&rsquo;s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service <a href=\"http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43292.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>compiled</u></a> the reports in 2013.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/2013-10-21-budget-battle-postmortem.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mark Zandi</u></a>, chief economist for Moody&rsquo;s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown&rsquo;s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/sp-cuts-us-growth-view-2013-10\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Standard and Poor&#39;s</u></a> said the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent.
