In 2000, he was the only senator who voted against a resolution \"encouraging local schools to insist on zero-tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug use.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n In 2001, he offered the only \"nay\" on an amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act that shielded teachers from civil liability.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I don't think the federal government ought to be federalizing something that's been under the state purview for 200 years,\" Thompson told a crowd in Sioux City, Iowa, Sept. 7, 2007.  \"Give me a good reason why, when the federal government... can't get its own act together, why it ought to be taking on these other things in order to get a press release and a headline? ... That's not the right thing to do.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n But he wasn't perfect. As a senator from 1994 to 2003, Thompson did divert from his federalist philosophy in at least one big way: supporting President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which sets federal standards for local schools.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:37.735230", "ruling_date": "2007-09-12T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Federalist Fred", "ruling_headline_slug": "federalist-fred", "ruling_link_text": "Federalist Fred", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n Roll Call Votes\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=105&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00055\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Volunteer Protection Act\n </a>\n Passed, 99 to 1.
