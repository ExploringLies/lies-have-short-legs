We found the <a href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/10/survey-85-of-new-college-grads-moving-back-in-with-mom-and-dad/\">article</a> in question, which was headlined, &quot;Survey: 85% of New College Grads Move Back in with Mom and Dad.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story begins, &quot;The kids are coming home to roost. Surprise, surprise: Thanks to a high unemployment rate for new grads, many of those with diplomas fresh off the press are making a return to Mom and Dad&rsquo;s place. In fact, according to a poll conducted by consulting firm <a href=\"http://www.twentysomething.com/index.html\">Twentysomething Inc.</a>, some 85% of graduates will soon remember what Mom&rsquo;s cooking tastes like.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince the <em>Time </em>story didn&rsquo;t give any details on the study or give any indication that a reporter had called the firm -- the same was true for the two other media reports that cited the statistic, <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/of_college_grads_return_to_nest_kjMXejGjOymsRom3pz9gaM\">the <em>New York Post</em></a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/14/pf/boomerang_kids_move_home/index.htm\">CNNMoney.com</a> -- we tried to contact Twentysomething Inc. for additional details on the methodology and date of the survey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwentysomething&#39;s website was not much help. There was no news release about the study, and the phone number listed had been disconnected. It appears the site hasn&#39;t been updated since 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, we received a call back from David A. Morrison, the firm&rsquo;s managing director and founding partner. Morrison said he had closed down his Philadelphia-based firm after about two decades of operation and left the area. He told us the poll had been done for a client &quot;many years ago&quot; but would not release any details about the methodology, citing a binding non-disclosure agreement with the client, whom he would not name.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorrison speculated that his client had leaked the numbers to the media. &quot;These numbers tend to get recycled,&quot; Morrison said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe is right about it being recycled. The statistic has been repeated many times on websites and blogs -- <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/13/college-graduates-moving-home-debt_n_861849.html\">twice</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/24/moving-home-college-graduates-jobs_n_865623.html\">Huffington Post</a>, for instance, and once in the personal finance blog <a href=\"http://ptmoney.com/boomerang-generation/\">PT Money</a>. It even was picked up by bloggers both liberal (<a href=\"http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=439x1123239\">Democratic Underground</a>) and conservative (<a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2608123/posts\">Free Republic</a>), each with their own political spin. We did not hear back from the author of the <em>Time </em>magazine article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorrison told us that given the fact the survey was done &quot;many years ago,&quot; it was not accurate to use statistic the way the ad did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What&rsquo;s the actual number?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs it happens, there are credible statistics about grads returning home, from a <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/03/PewSocialTrends-2012-BoomerangGeneration.pdf\">report released March 15, 2012 by the Pew Research Center</a>, titled &quot;The Boomerang Generation: Feeling OK about Living with Mom and Dad.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report included a survey of 2,048 adults nationwide conducted Dec. 6 to Dec. 19, 2011. Unlike Twentysomething, Pew offered extensive documentation about how it had conducted the poll and what the results were.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report examines the boomerang phenomenon for different demographic groups, but none come close to 85 percent:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Among adults ages 18 to 29, 42 percent of those who have graduated college live with their parents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Among adults ages 25 to 29 with or without a college degree, 41 percent either live with or moved back in with their parents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Among adults ages 18 to 34, 24 percent moved back in with their parents in recent years after living on their own, due to economic conditions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Among parents of adult children, 29 percent report that a child of theirs has moved back in with them in the past few years because of the economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Pew report does show modest support for a trend of grads moving back home. It found that in 2010, almost 22 percent of adults ages 25 to 34 lived in a &quot;multigenerational household,&quot; up from about 16 percent in 2000; of these, the vast majority were living with their parents. (&quot;Multi-generational households&quot; are defined to include parents living with children 25 and older, or households with three or more generations.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, when we take up a claim in which the speaker seeks to assign credit or blame to a politician for something that happens on their watch, we also consider whether credit or blame is warranted. And <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/26/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-youth-unemployment-rate-double-wh/\">as we have ruled in the past</a>, no president can unilaterally move the economy, much less determine whether grads have to move home with Mom and Dad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There was a worldwide credit bubble that led to a worldwide financial collapse that led to a global Great Recession,&quot; said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation told us last month. &quot;If you accept that observation, it becomes hard to blame anyone in the U.S. overly for the results.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tFoster added, &quot;The simple political narrative is to blame the other side. Fair enough to a point. The party in power always gets too much blame and too much credit, depending on circumstances.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it&#39;s a stretch to blame Obama if more grads are returning home.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad cites a questionable survey and suggests the data is new when the author says the survey was &quot;many years ago.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, the 85 percent figure is at least twice the highest rate found by Pew, a well-respected research group. And the ad blames Obama for a phenomenon that economists say is beyond the impact of a president. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-01T16:37:12.399607", "ruling_date": "2012-05-01T18:33:26", "ruling_headline": "American Crossroads ad says 85 percent of recent college grads are moving in with Mom and Dad", "ruling_headline_slug": "american-crossroads-ad-says-85-percent-recent-coll", "ruling_link_text": "Questionable survey from years ago", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmerican Crossroads, &quot;Cool&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhXGkeMdOJs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">ad</a>), April 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPew Research Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2012/03/PewSocialTrends-2012-BoomerangGeneration.pdf\">The Boomerang Generation: Feeling OK about Living with Mom and Dad</a>,&quot; March 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwentysomething Consulting and Research, <a href=\"http://www.twentysomething.com/index.html\">w</a><a href=\"http://www.twentysomething.com/index.html\">ebsite,</a> accessed April 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Time</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/10/survey-85-of-new-college-grads-moving-back-in-with-mom-and-dad/\">Survey</a><a href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/10/survey-85-of-new-college-grads-moving-back-in-with-mom-and-dad/\">: 85% of New College Grads Move Back in with Mom and Dad,&quot; May</a> 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>New York Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/of_college_grads_return_to_nest_kjMXejGjOymsRom3pz9gaM\">85% of college grads return to nest</a>,&quot; May 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCNNMoney.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/14/pf/boomerang_kids_move_home/index.htm\">Boomerang kids: 85% of college grads move home</a>,&quot; Nov. 15, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with David A.
