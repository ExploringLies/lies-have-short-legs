Wendy Davis is &quot;fighting to bring California values to Texas&quot; including &quot;Bloomberg-style gun control.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting aside how much California agrees with New York&rsquo;s gun-control advocate mayor Michael Bloomberg, we thought Texans would want to know Davis&rsquo; views, as her bid to become governor is the first statewide campaign for the Fort Worth Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis hasn&rsquo;t, so far, focused on gun control in her campaign. Abbott, a Republican who&rsquo;s served as Texas&rsquo; attorney general since 2002, <a href=\"http://www.gregabbott.com/issues/\"><u>says</u></a> on his campaign site that he&rsquo;ll fight federal limits on gun rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott campaign spokesmen Matt Hirsch and Avdiel Huerta told us by email that Davis, a former Fort Worth City Council member elected to the Senate in 2008, had &quot;voted twice against campus carry,&quot; &quot;voted to prohibit gun shows in Fort Worth,&quot; supported background checks for gun buyers and had opposed a measure to remove cities&rsquo; abilities to restrict guns in municipal buildings; they also provided citations and backup materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked for specifics on &quot;Bloomberg-style,&quot; Huerta sent a March 26, 2013, PolitiFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/26/michael-bloomberg/michael-bloomberg-nra-used-support-more-background/\"><u>fact-check</u></a> that said, &quot;Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Bloomberg, a powerful advocate for gun control both locally and nationally, has long urged and in some cases helped enact measures including strengthening punishments for those who illegally possess guns, registering gun offenders and banning military-style weapons. He also focuses on &quot;straw&quot; purchases -- those made by people who intend to re-sell the weapons to illegal buyers -- and has been criticized for his city administration&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>sting operations in other states to uncover such transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg co-founded and co-chairs <a href=\"http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/home/1000mayors.html\"><u>Mayors Against Illegal Guns</u></a>, a group that <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-24/mayor-bloomberg-unveils-12-million-ad-campaign-for-gun-checks.html\"><u>launched</u></a> a $12 million, 13-state ad campaign March 23, 2013, promoting expanded <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/14/us/universal-background-checks/\"><u>background checks</u></a>. Group spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb told us by email that &quot;Bloomberg-style&quot; could fairly be defined as &quot;common-sense gun reforms that will save American lives by keeping guns out of dangerous hands.&quot; Universal background checks -- requiring private sellers everywhere (<a href=\"http://www.demandaction.org/fixgunchecks\"><u>not just at gun shows</u></a>) to run background checks -- are a prime example and the group&rsquo;s priority, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis on gun shows</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hirsch of Abbott&rsquo;s campaign emailed us citations from news stories saying that as a member of the Fort Worth City Council in 2000, Davis<strong> </strong>supported making sure all buyers faced background checks at gun shows<strong> </strong>in city-owned facilities and that she recently told the <em>Texas Tribune</em> she still held that view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Sept. 11, 2013, <em>Tribune </em><a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2013/09/11/guns-could-be-issue-governors-race/\"><u>news story</u></a> Hirsch emailed to us<em> </em>said Davis was a gun owner and quoted her as saying of the gun show restrictions, &quot;I haven&rsquo;t pursued it as a senator because I know it&rsquo;s like spitting in the wind&quot; and &quot;But I still believe it&rsquo;s the right thing. And if I were governor and a bill came to my desk that provided for background checks at gun shows, I would sign that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hirsch also cited a Sept. 18, 2013, <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/18/wendy-davis-pivots-from-abortion-to-gun-control/\"><u>commentary</u></a> by Georgia writer Brandon Howell, posted on the conservative Daily Caller website, that went further, saying Davis also &quot;sought banning gun shows on city-owned property.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Fort Worth ordinance Davis proposed in 2000 could have barred some gun shows from city property, but was tabled along with a related proposal, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x7idk4Gk5fzamfI9q0T8IUJ6NDUFUdESllJnFQ0YSjY/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>news stories</u></a> starting in 2000 about a months-long city government debate on gun control that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Aug. 9, 2000, news story in the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> said her ordinance would have placed restrictions on shows &quot;including provisions that would allow only licensed dealers to sell firearms on city premises.&quot; According to the story, Davis said that another option was requiring background checks on gun buyers at the shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A July 19, 2000, <em>News </em>story said Davis also supported the other tabled proposal, a resolution by which the council would have asked the federal government to require background checks of gun show buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg supports background checks on gun show buyers, evidenced notably when he sent New York investigators to gun shows in states as far away as Nevada in <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113594508\"><u>2006</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113594508\"><u>2009</u></a> and <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/01/nation/la-na-bloomberg-arizona-guns-20110201\"><u>2011</u></a> to find evidence that private dealers would sell to buyers who wouldn&rsquo;t pass background checks.

In the 2013 session, Davis was among the <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/83r/pdf/83RSJ04-30-F.PDF#page=11\"><u>&quot;yea&quot; votes</u></a> when the Senate approved, 27-4, a proposal to <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/analysis/html/SB01907I.htm\"><u>allow</u></a> college students with concealed-handgun licenses to store handguns in locked vehicles on campus. The measure became law and took effect Sept. 1, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daily Caller item Hirsch provided to us described that as &quot;an easy vote&quot; for Davis because the proposal passed by such a wide margin. Davis told the bill&rsquo;s author, according to an April 30, 2013, <em>Star-Telegram</em> <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/04/30/4815657/bill-allowing-more-weapons-on.html\"><u>news story</u></a>, that &quot;she planned to support his bill but said she wanted his assurance that &lsquo;you will not allow that opening, that broad opening to become a part of what you&rsquo;re passing out of here today.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;You understand that there are many of us in the Senate chamber who are concerned about the broader impacts of carrying on campus.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said Davis later issued a statement saying that &quot;it is important that the local control of colleges and universities over their campuses be preserved with regard to carrying guns on campus.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis on concealed-carry measures and cities&rsquo; abilities to restrict guns</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=A30E4CA6-C29C-7CA2-F953D72A9BED2F3D\"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> and his group have long opposed <a href=\"http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=F801FB8F-C29C-7CA2-F80CE3504D02DFE3\"><u>letting states recognize</u></a> out-of-state concealed-carry permits.

Davis voted <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/83r/pdf/83RSJ05-20-F.PDF#page=30\"><u>for a proposal</u></a> to <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/senate-dont-require-ssns-for-gun-permits/nXxMD/\"><u>prohibit</u></a> state officials from requiring applicants&rsquo; Social Security numbers that became law and takes effect Jan. 1, 2014, and <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=SB864\"><u>for</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/83r/pdf/83RSJ05-21-F.PDF#page=157\"><u>two</u></a> measures that became law effective Sept. 1, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/analysis/html/SB00864F.htm\"><u>cutting</u></a> the number of instruction hours needed and <a href=\"http://www.hro.house.state.tx.us/pdf/ba83r/hb0048.pdf#navpanes=0\"><u>eliminating</u></a> the need to take a proficiency test. The Senate approved the measures by votes of, respectively, 25-6, 29-1 and 27-4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acu&ntilde;a also noted that Davis <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/83r/pdf/83RSJ04-04-F.PDF#page=26\"><u>voted for</u></a> a measure <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/analysis/html/SB00987F.htm\"><u>allowing</u></a> the state&rsquo;s attorney general to get an injunction against a city or county that breaks state law by restricting ownership, transport, licensing or other actions regarding firearms, ammunition and supplies. The Senate approved it 24-6; it became law and took effect June 14, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a new restriction on cities, but rather a specific way to enable the enforcement of existing state law that bars such local restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is Wendy like Mike?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mayoral group&rsquo;s spokeswoman named universal background checks as &quot;Bloomberg-like.&quot; So does the NRA, it turns out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spokesman Andrew Arulanandam of the NRA&rsquo;s lobbying arm told us by phone, &quot;AG Abbott is correct in his assessment,&quot; based on Bloomberg&rsquo;s federal-level push for expanding background checks and Davis&rsquo; remarks to the Texas Tribune favoring &quot;background checks at gun shows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Texas State Rifle Association, which is affiliated with the NRA, spokeswoman Alice Tripp told us by phone that she agreed with Abbott based on Davis&rsquo; 2000 push for background checks at gun shows. &quot;Bloomberg seems to attack firearm ownership in that kind of parental way,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, told us by email her group hopes Davis &quot;will come out in support of common-sense gun reform, including background checks,&quot; and said that to her group, &quot;Bloomberg-style gun control&quot; is not a pejorative term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The groups did not have scorecards or endorsements for specific candidates this far ahead of Texas&rsquo; Nov. 4, 2014,<strong> </strong>general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott said Davis is<strong> </strong>&quot;fighting to bring&quot; &quot;Bloomberg-style gun control to Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Bloomberg, Davis supports<strong> </strong>background checks for all<strong> </strong>buyers at gun shows. She has opposed campus-carry measures, but voted to allow concealed weapons locked in vehicles while warning the author not to take it any farther. She has opposed letting the state tell cities or colleges they can&rsquo;t regulate guns on their property, but voted to let the state pursue injunctions against cities that overstep limitations currently in state law. She joined most of the Senate in voting for three laws simplifying concealed-handgun permit applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis has taken some actions Bloomberg might approve, and others he might not. However, she doesn&rsquo;t appear, so far, to be &quot;fighting&quot; for tighter gun control if elected governor.
