We&rsquo;re wondering about what Tovo adds in her mailers: &quot;And one of (Shade&rsquo;s) biggest contributors is the racetrack lobbyist.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTovo&rsquo;s campaign manager, Mark Yznaga, told us in a telephone interview the lobbyist is Richard Suttle, a partner in the influential Austin law firm, <a href=\"http://www.abaustin.com/overview.php\">Armbrust &amp; Brown</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYznaga conceded that Suttle has personally given Shade&rsquo;s campaign only $25, the <a href=\"http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/election/downloads/tab_4_candidate_and_officeholder_brochure.pdf\">maximum</a> any lobbyist working City Hall can give per election. But, he said, lawyers and spouses connected to the Armbrust &amp; Brown firm accounted for 51 firm-connected contributions, 45 for $350, six for $25, for a total $15,900 from late December through April 4, the end of the latest reporting period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNudged about Suttle&rsquo;s tiny donation, Yznaga replied: &quot;You&rsquo;re being silly. It&rsquo;s quite well known in the city that (Suttle) is the lobbyist who does a lot of Armbrust &amp; Brown work.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYznaga noted that 16 members of the firm, which <a href=\"http://www.abaustin.com/attorneys.php\">lists</a> 21 lawyers on its website, contributed the maximum allowed, $350. And he pointed out that David Armbrust, among the firm&rsquo;s founders, is listed on Shade&rsquo;s finance filings as a bundler, which the city defines as anyone who has solicited and obtained contributions for the candidate adding up to more than $5,000 during a finance reporting period. Armbrust, like Suttle a <a href=\"http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/cityclerk/lobbyist/detail_clients.cfm?id=2\">city-registered lobbyist</a>, gave $25.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuttle is a familiar figure at City Hall, where he frequently represents real estate developers. He has <a href=\"http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/cityclerk/lobbyist/detail_clients.cfm?id=64\">reported</a> 55 clients to the city, including Circuit of the Americas, which is building the racetrack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we reached Suttle, who called the characterization of him as one of Shade&rsquo;s biggest contributors &quot;a stretch. It&rsquo;s old-school campaign lies.&quot; The city ordinance limiting individuals who lobby the city to $25 donations means he couldn&rsquo;t be a top donor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I have to chuckle,&quot; he said, adding that he told his wife, who also donated $25 to Shade&rsquo;s campaign: &quot;I guess 50 bucks gets us on the big contributors list now.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a telephone interview, Shade&rsquo;s campaign manager, Katherine Haenschen, pointed out that the money donated by the Suttles accounted for a minuscule share of more than $168,000 Shade raised from November through April 4.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe said by email: &quot;By my calculations, our average donation is $208. Suttle&#39;s $25 is<br />\r\n\tabout 1/8 of that. Furthermore, the last time I checked, there are only 10 individuals who have donated LESS than Richard Suttle!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat may be true. But donors connected to Armbrust &amp; Brown accounted for 9 percent of Shade&rsquo;s contributions through April 4. Shade&rsquo;s finance reports show 9 bundlers other than Armbrust accounting for 15 percent of her campaign contributions through April 4. The next-most-successful single bundler raised about $6,300, less than half Armbrust&rsquo;s haul for Shade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tArmbrust&rsquo;s bundling is surely appreciated by the incumbent and signals the firm&rsquo;s lawyers, including Suttle, want her to win a second term. But Tovo overshoots when she spears the racetrack lobbyist. Other members of his law firm are responsible for sending far more money Shade&rsquo;s way.
