Nathan Deal of Gainesville, a name: &quot;a former Clinton Democrat.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFormer Democrat? Yes. But was Deal a big supporter of Clinton?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font>Handel rose in the polls as a possible front-runner only weeks before Tuesday&#39;s primary, where she captured 33 percent of the vote. </font>Deal trailed her by 10 points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe two will face off Aug. 10 to see which Republican will go head to head in November against the Democratic nominee, former Gov. Roy Barnes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHandel went on the attack just hours after her primary win, during a live, four-minute interview Wednesday morning. She was responding to a claim by Deal that he&#39;s the only &quot;true conservative.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe laughed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You know, I&rsquo;m not going to be lectured by Nathan Deal, who is a former Clinton Democrat. I will stack up my conservative credentials against his any day of the week,&quot; Handel told the WSB-TV anchor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Fox 5 asked her the same question, she renewed the charge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a little history about Democrats in Georgia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal served in the state Senate starting in 1981 as a conservative Democrat. Democrats dominated Southern politics at the time, and Georgia was no exception. Conservative Democrats were common.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith the start of the 1990s, conservative Democrats increasingly switched to the GOP. Deal followed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal was a Democrat during his first congressional win in 1992, the year of Bill Clinton&#39;s first presidential victory. Deal won again as a Democrat in 1994.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in April 1995, after the GOP took control of the U.S. House and Senate during the Republican takeover, Deal switched parties and became a Republican. He has stuck with the GOP ever since.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal resigned from the U.S. House on March 21 to focus on his gubernatorial bid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Handel campaign gave four reasons why it thinks Deal deserves the &quot;former Clinton Democrat&quot; label. First is that he was elected to Congress as a Democrat when Clinton was at the top of the ticket. This is correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHandel&#39;s camp also brought up three pieces of legislation from 1993: two on the budget and a third on gays in the military.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first had to do with a 1993 budget vote. Handel&#39;s team claims Deal&#39;s &quot;yes&quot; vote was for a tax increase. Deal&#39;s people said that vote was on a procedural issue, and Deal voted against Clinton&rsquo;s tax hike during the vote that really mattered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second was Clinton&#39;s economic stimulus package. He supported a Republican amendment to the bill &quot;that would have forced Congress to offset any new spending with revenue increases or spending cuts,&quot; according to a news account. When it failed, Deal voted for the package.<br />\r\n\tThe third was a bill that opposed Clinton&#39;s efforts to lift the ban on gays in the military. It would have amended a U.S. Department of Defense appropriations bill to require the military to ask people entering the armed forces whether they were homosexual or bisexual. Deal voted against it.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Deal served in Congress as a Democrat, he was by no means in lock step with Clinton -- even on the president&#39;s major initiatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font>Deal voted for legislation that called ending the ban on gays in the military an &quot;unacceptable risk.&quot; </font>Clinton settled for instituting the &quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; policy, which remains in place.<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal voted against Clinton&#39;s successful push for a family-leave bill guaranteeing millions of workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to deal with family emergencies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The purpose of the bill is noble, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the kind of thing the federal government should force on employers,&quot; he said at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Clinton proposed $10 billion in budget cuts in 1993, Deal said they were &quot;not really enough.&quot; He was described in an October 1993 account in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as &quot;a key member&quot; of a bipartisan group that pushed him to cut more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, Deal&#39;s voting record showed that Deal -- once he switched to the GOP -- was more of a Bush Republican than he was a Clinton Democrat while he was in Clinton&#39;s party.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tIn 1993, Deal voted in support of Clinton-backed bills 59 percent of the time, according to an analysis of voting patterns by Congressional Quarterly. In 1994, his support stood at 64 percent.<br />\r\n\tDeal&#39;s support for the president plummeted to 23 percent when he became a Republican. It&nbsp; hovered in the midteens during Clinton&#39;s final three years, then shot up to 93 percent when Bush took office in 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1998, Deal voted to impeach Clinton.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovTrack.us<font><font>, a group</font></font> that tracks Congress, rates Deal as a &quot;rank and file Republican,&quot; based on his record of bill sponsorship.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, political experts we interviewed were uncomfortable with describing Deal as a &quot;former Clinton Democrat.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCharles Bullock, an expert on Southern politics with the University of Georgia, said he &quot;probably wouldn&#39;t&quot; use that term to describe Deal. Conservative Democrats generally came down to the right of a lot of Clinton&#39;s first-term agenda, especially on gays in the military.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Handel&#39;s campaign listed Deal&#39;s votes accurately, its take on his record while he was a Democrat ignores critical facts. Deal broke with Clinton to side with Republicans on a variety of legislation, including bills that were important parts of the president&#39;s agenda.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurthermore, when Deal became a Republican, the bipartisanship evident during his career as a Democrat all but vanished. He voted enthusiastically against the president, including during Clinton&#39;s impeachment. Deal was no pal to Clinton.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Handel&#39;s statement Barely True.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
