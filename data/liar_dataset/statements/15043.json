In addition, the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/school-shootings-year-article-1.3821162\">New York Daily News</a> claimed 18 school shootings, listing the same incidents as Everytown, and <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-school-shootings-in-2018-and-its-only-february_us_5a85d9d2e4b0039fd7ad9ee8\">HuffPost</a> reported 18, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are some major caveats to that figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, when we asked Greenfield for information to back up his claim, he noted to us in his email that the Everytown group&rsquo;s count &quot;conflates very different incidents, from the harmless to the deadly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As PolitiFact National has reported, Everytown, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/14/what-we-know-about-mass-shootings/\">uses a broad definition</a> of school shooting -- that is, any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building, or on a school campus or grounds. Its database includes incidents when no one was injured; attempted or completed suicide, with no intent to injure others; and cases when a gun was fired unintentionally, resulting in injury or death. The list also includes incidents on college campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ll see, Everytown counts shooting incidents that are dramatically different than what happened in Florida:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/school-shootings/5955/\">2018 U.S. school shootings as counted by Everytown</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Date</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Place</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Details</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Jan. 3</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>East Olive Elementary, St. Johns, Mich.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Man committed <strong>suicide</strong> in parking lot. <strong>No other injuries</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>(We found the building was not being used as a school, as East Olive had been <a href=\"https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/01/04/potterville-man-died-self-inflicted-wound-after-hours-negotiation/1002904001/\">shut down</a> more than six months earlier.)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Jan. 4</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>New Start High, Seattle</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Unidentified shooter fired shots <strong>into building.

But they do not happen with the same <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-correct-mass-killings-dont-happen-oth/\">frequency</a> as in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two researchers -- Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University -- analyzed mass shootings in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000-14. Aside from the United States, they looked at Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States had more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, according to their research. While part of this is because the United States has a much bigger population than all but China, the difference can&rsquo;t be explained by skewed population numbers alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as for the other part of Greenfield&rsquo;s claim -- that there have been only 18 school shootings in the rest of the world over the past 20 years -- Greenfield told us he couldn&rsquo;t recall the source of that information, adding, &quot;yes, I cop to insufficient research.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive (which the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/15/us/school-shootings-sandy-hook-parkland.html\"><em>New York Times</em> uses</a> to track school shooting data), told us the 18-shootings figure could be correct in terms of how many mass shootings occur in schools outside of the United States that get widespread news coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Bryant said there is no way to know -- based on the definition of school shootings that Greenfield relies on -- how many such shootings occur around the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 24 hours after posting&nbsp;the&nbsp;tweet, Greenfield took it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Greenfield said: &quot;In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By one count widely cited in the news media, there have been 18 incidents in which shots were fired inside or outside of a school or university building in the United States so far in 2018. But only three involved a mass shooting. And the count includes two suicides, three accidental shootings and nine incidents in which there were no fatalities or injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the rest of the world, Greenfield had no evidence to back up that part of his claim. And an expert relied on by the<em> New York Times</em> for gun violence statistics told us there is no way to know how many school shootings -- using the definition Greenfield relies on -- have occurred outside of the United States over the past 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-15T17:49:13.198012", "ruling_date": "2018-02-15T17:49:19", "ruling_headline": "Mostly False: 18 U.S. school shootings so far in 2018 and 18 in rest of the world over past 20 years", "ruling_headline_slug": "mostly-false-18-us-school-shootings-so-far-2018-an", "ruling_link_text": "School shooting definition key", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greenfield64/status/963908153325772800\">Jeff Greenfield tweet</a>, Feb. 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Jeff Greenfield, Feb. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/14/what-we-know-about-mass-shootings/\">&quot;What we know about mass shootings,&quot;</a> Feb. 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/school-shootings/5832/\">&quot;291 School Shootings In America Since 2013,&quot;</a> accessed Feb. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/school-shootings/5832/#5955\">2018 U.S. school shootings</a>, accessed Feb. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/no-there-havent-been-18-school-shooting-in-2018-that-number-is-flat-wrong/2018/02/15/65b6cf72-1264-11e8-8ea1-c1d91fcec3fe_story.html?utm_term=.2f0b203ad2e8\">&quot;No, there haven&rsquo;t been 18 school shootings in 2018.
