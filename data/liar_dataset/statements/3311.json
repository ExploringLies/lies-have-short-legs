(Others who have this opinion argue that the burden on the rich is even higher. <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/trent-franks/trent-franks-says-top-1-percent-pays-over-half-ent/\">PolitiFact.com examined those claims</a> in 2010.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a Feb. 13 community dinner at the Pilgrim Senior Center, in Warwick, Sen Sheldon Whitehouse offered a different perspective to argue that the richest aren&#39;t overtaxed at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The IRS recently reported that the 400 biggest income earners in the country were making $334 million each, and were paying 16.6 percent in taxes,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to<a href=\"http://warwickonline.com/view/full_story_news/11413483/article-Voters-dish-out-questions-on-economy?instance=home_news_2nd_left\"> an account of the meeting in The Warwick Beacon</a>, Whitehouse went on to say that, most people wouldn&rsquo;t have a tax rate that low unless their income was $28,100 or below.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A hospital orderly making $29,000 a year is therefore paying a higher rate of taxes on their income than someone making $344 million,&quot; the Beacon quoted Whitehouse as saying.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check elements of both statements -- the rate the rich paid and the lower income level that would trigger a similar rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Whitehouse&#39;s staff for the source of the 16.6 percent figure, they sent us to an IRS website that has<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/07intop400.pdf\"> statistics on the tax returns of the 400 individual taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross incomes</a>. &nbsp;The most recent tax year available is 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(According to a transcript provided to us by the Whitehouse staff, the senator actually said he thought the report was from 2009.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne other clarification is important. The IRS is reporting on the top 400 individual tax returns, which could include a couple filing jointly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe IRS report says that, in 2007, the average adjusted gross income for the top 400 returns was $344 million. The average income tax paid per return was $57 million -- an average of 16.6 percent, as Whitehouse said. So on that point, he was right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOut of curiosity, members of PolitiFact Rhode Island checked our returns for 2007. We found that our tax rates were even lower than 16.6 percent, and we make a lot more than Whitehouse&#39;s hypothetical $29,000-a-year hospital orderly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we checked Whitehouse&#39;s example, using tax rates,<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/Content/PDF/file_threshold.pdf\"> standard deductions and personal exemptions</a> for both<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1040tt--2007.pdf\"> 2007</a> and<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040tt.pdf\"> 2010</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe discovered that Whitehouse was off -- way off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat unmarried orderly filing a simple single return would be taxed at a rate of 9.1 percent in 2007 and 8.7 percent in 2010, not more than 16.6.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen, using IRS tax tables and schedules, we did some math to determine how much income a single person filing the simplest tax return would need before his tax rate exceeded that of the richest Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo hit a tax rate of 16.6 percent, that orderly would need to have made about $68,750 in 2007 and $73,500 in 2010, we calculated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we showed our numbers to Whitehouse&#39;s staff, they said our results were misleading because we failed to include taxes for Medicare (1.45 percent) and Social Security (6.2 percent on the first $106,000 of income).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The vast majority of the income of the 400 wealthiest Americans is not subject to payroll taxes, whereas a worker with annual income around $29,000 would have to pay payroll taxes on all of their income,&quot; a statement from Whitehouse&rsquo;s office said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Leaving this data out of any comparison will paint a very uneven picture of the total taxes paid by working-class Americans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough IRS spokeswoman Peggy Riley said those taxes are <em>not</em> factored into the IRS analysis, we understand the point of including them because the Social Security tax, in particular, has a significant impact on low- and middle-income people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to calculations by Whitehouse&rsquo;s office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16.72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16.79 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS&#39;s most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he&#39;s right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement as<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"> </a><a href=\"http://politifact.com/about/\">Mostly True.</a></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-24T18:49:30.906498", "ruling_date": "2011-02-25T00:00:01", "ruling_headline": "Whitehouse says richest 400 taxpayers are taxed at a lower rate than a $29,000-a-year worker", "ruling_headline_slug": "whitehouse-says-richest-400-taxpayers-taxed-lower-", "ruling_link_text": "He's right, if you include all payroll taxes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/trent-franks/trent-franks-says-top-1-percent-pays-over-half-ent/\">Trent Franks says top 1 percent pays over half of the entire revenue for U.S.</a>,&quot; July 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWarwickOnline.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://warwickonline.com/view/full_story_news/11413483/article-Voters-dish-out-questions-on-economy?instance=home_news_2nd_left\">Voters dish out questions on economy</a>,&quot; Feb. 15, 2011, accessed Feb. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails and interview, Seth Larson, spokesman, Sen.
