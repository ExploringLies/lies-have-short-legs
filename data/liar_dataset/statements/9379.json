Gwen Moore described Milwaukee as one of the worst places in the country for child sex trafficking, there were reasons to think it might be so. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the space of two weeks in early 2012, two Milwaukee pimps were sentenced to long prison terms. One, who had painted the words &quot;Ho Hauler&quot; on his van and shipped child prostitutes to Chicago and elsewhere to sell sex, got 30 years behind bars. The other, who gained fame in movies and on television as &quot;Pimp Snooky,&quot; had prostituted scores of women and girls in cities from Milwaukee to Las Vegas for at least 16 years, according to federal prosecutors. He got 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, it was startling on May 20, 2014 when Moore spoke on the House floor in favor of a bill that aims to help underage victims of prostitution. The House passed the measure later that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m embarrassed and I regret to report that my own hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has become known as a sex-trafficking hub for both children and adults,&quot; said Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a matter of fact, the FBI reports that Milwaukee has the second-highest in the nation for recovered youth. But trafficking is now common in communities all across the country, not just urban, but suburban, rural, from coast to coast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second in the nation is something we wanted to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sex trafficking crackdown</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2013, 10 months before Moore made her claim, the FBI announced what it described as its seventh and largest-ever child sex trafficking enforcement action. Over three days and across 76 cities, officers arrested 153 pimps and identified more than 105 children as having been sexually exploited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee tied with Detroit for the second-highest number of children recovered, as the FBI puts it, with 10. San Francisco was first, with 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s what Moore was referring to when she made her second-in-the-nation claim, according to her spokeswoman, Staci Cox. &quot;When reading her statement on the House floor, the Congresswoman inadvertently did not specify the context in which the statistic was based,&quot; Cox told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of one enforcement action, of course, do not establish Milwaukee as having the nation&#39;s second-highest child sex trafficking recoveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question remains: Just how serious is child sex trafficking in Milwaukee?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2013, a Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission study, which was based on contacts youths had with Milwaukee police, estimated that 77 youths had been &quot;sex trafficked&quot; during the two-year period ending on Aug. 1, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those youths were in addition to those who were involved in sex trafficking cases that were investigated or prosecuted by federal authorities during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study defined trafficked as minors who were &quot;suspected or known to have been recruited, encouraged, or obtained for the purpose of a commercial sex act or sexually explicit performance.&quot; They were primarily African-American girls ages 12 to 17 who lived on the city&#39;s north side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how does that level of sex trafficking compare with other cities?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one knows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no reliable ranking of cities in terms of child sex trafficking or, using the statistic Moore cited, the number of children recovered from sex trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s according to the Polaris Project, which runs the National Human Resource Center Trafficking Hotline for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have not heard of any systematic effort to count these cases and much of the effort to track this down has turned to dead ends,&quot; Finkelhor told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finkelhor noted that, even if there were more police contacts in Milwaukee than in other cities regarding child sex trafficking, it could mean the problem is worse in Milwaukee -- or it could simply mean that Milwaukee police are more proactive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the children being recovered from sex trafficking, it&rsquo;s &quot;very misleading,&quot; Finkelhour told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Police do a variety of things when they encounter youth engaged in selling sex -- from arresting them, to making referrals to agencies, to bringing them back to their families -- but most of the professionals in the field agree that large numbers of youth return to the streets or to commercial sex activity,&quot; Finkelhor said. &quot;The whole narrative on this topic is filled with problems.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore said &quot;Milwaukee has the second-highest&quot; number of children recovered from sex trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pimp prosecutions, FBI crackdowns and a local study have established that child sex trafficking is a serious problem in Milwaukee. But Moore acknowledges she didn&rsquo;t state her claim accurately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There simply is no comprehensive data available comparing cities on the extent of the problem, nor on the number of children who are recovered from the trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Moore&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-29T10:37:18.158880", "ruling_date": "2014-06-01T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Is Milwaukee ranked second in the U.S. for number of children recovered from sex trafficking?", "ruling_headline_slug": "milwaukee-among-cities-worst-child-sex-trafficking", "ruling_link_text": "No data available comparing cities", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?319460-2/us-house-legislative-business\"><u>video</u></a> of U.S. Rep.
