There hasn&rsquo;t been a minimum wage increase in four years, and the prospect of an increase -- particularly in the Republican-controlled House -- looks dim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped advocates of a higher minimum wage from making their case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/53542598/ns/msnbc-politicsnation/#.UoU3CSd_AYQ\"><u>recent interview</u></a> with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said that at its current level, the minimum wage is inadequate for making an acceptable living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The minimum wage at the federal level has been frozen for four years at $7.75,&quot; he said on Nov. 12, 2013. &quot;In the state of Washington, we&rsquo;ve raised it to $9.15 and people there took it in their own hands and said, let&rsquo;s go to $15 because people have gotten fed up with Washington, D.C. They don&rsquo;t expect a thing to come out of Congress. &hellip; On $7.75 you can&rsquo;t even make half the poverty level. You&rsquo;ve got to have two jobs. You have to work 80 hours a week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered: Is it true that if you are paid $7.75 an hour, &quot;you can&#39;t even make half the poverty level?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First off, we need to correct one aspect of McDermott&rsquo;s claim.While he&rsquo;s right that the federal minimum wage has been static for the past four years, it&rsquo;s $7.25 an hour, not $7.75. But because he was specific about the dollar amount, we&rsquo;ll use that to make our calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you earned $7.75 an hour for 40 hours a week and 52 weeks a year, you would earn $16,120. For this to be less than half the poverty level, the poverty level would have to be at least $32,240.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the poverty level that high? For most households, no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal poverty level is actually a <a href=\"http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/tools-for-advocates/guides/federal-poverty-guidelines.html\"><u>matrix</u></a> of different dollar amounts. It depends on the size of the family, with larger families having a higher threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poverty level only exceeds $32,240 for families with at least seven people -- say, two parents and five children, or one parent and six children. (For a seven-person household, an income of $35,610 is right at the poverty level.) If we were to use the actual minimum wage of $7.25, the yearly income would be less than half of poverty for a six-person family, rather than seven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that seven-person households are a small fraction of all households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0064.pdf\"><u>Census Bureau</u></a>, only 9 percent of households have even three children, and the number with five (or six, if it&#39;s a single-parent household) is even smaller. Extrapolating from <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0884238.html\"><u>2006 data</u></a>, we estimate that about 2 percent of households have at least five children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, McDermott&rsquo;s claim would be wrong for 98 percent of households. And this may even understate how wrong he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the federal Earned Income Tax Credit -- which provides a refundable tax credit to working people with low incomes -- a poverty-level household with two adults and two children would be eligible for $5,372 in tax credits, noted Michael Wiseman, a professor of public policy and economics at George Washington University. That would make McDermott&rsquo;s scenario even more far-fetched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for McDermott acknowledged that he &quot;misspoke,&quot; both about the amount of the federal minimum wage and about how far that wage would go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The point he was trying to make was that the current minimum wage is nowhere close to a livable wage,&quot; said spokeswoman Amber Macdonald.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McDermott said that &quot;on (the federal minimum wage of) $7.75, you can&rsquo;t even make half the poverty level.&quot; He&rsquo;s wrong about what the federal minimum wage is -- it&rsquo;s $7.25. And<strong> </strong>for about 98 percent of households, he&rsquo;s wrong that a year of working at that wage rate wouldn&rsquo;t even get you to half of the poverty level. We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-14T16:11:54.645360", "ruling_date": "2013-11-15T11:35:38", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
