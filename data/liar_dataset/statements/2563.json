Leah Vukmir vs. Democratic incumbent Jim Sullivan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoing door to door, Vukmir distributes a <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/VukmirFlier.pdf\">flier</a> that says she will work to improve the economy, attract more jobs and cut taxes. In it, she also laments the current tax burden in the state, saying that in 2009, the Legislature &quot;passed more than $5 billion in tax increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve been here before.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd though the Legislature did raise taxes -- and fees -- quite a bit in 2009, the total wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near $5 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur research was done after Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, made almost the identical claim. We found that taxes and fees were upped by $3.14 billion in 2009.

But we&rsquo;ll repeat what we said in the Kleefisch claim: Property tax levies are set by local taxing bodies, such as the city and the county, not by the Legislature.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd we&rsquo;ll give Vukmir&rsquo;s claim the same rating: False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-09T16:54:47.285696", "ruling_date": "2010-10-11T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP state Senate candidate Leah Vukmir says the Legislature passed more than $5 billion in tax increases in 2009", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-state-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-says-legisl", "ruling_link_text": "It was wrong the first time we heard it -- and still is", "ruling_state": "Wisconsin", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Vukmir for Senate campaign spokesman Luke Bacher, Oct. 6, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/28/rebecca-kleefisch/republican-lieutenant-governor-candidate-rebecca-k/\">Republican lieutenant governor candidate Rebecca Kleefisch says state lawmakers raised taxes by $5 billion in 2009</a>, Sept. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVukmir for Senate <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/VukmirFlier.pdf\">flier</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Leah", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 746, "last_name": "Vukmir", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "leah-vukmir", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT_Leah_Vukmir.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/746/", "total_count": 15, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tIn 2009, &quot;the state Legislature passed more than $5 billion in tax increases.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign brochure distributed door to door", "statement_date": "2010-10-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
