He is attending his own &quot;masquerade ball&quot; &mdash; one where he&rsquo;s only pretending to be conservative.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>&quot;The Masquerade Ball gown Hasner has chosen on the key issues of taxes and spending is a prime example. Hasner&rsquo;s rhetoric simply does not match his record. Hasner&rsquo;s record includes:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Increasing Spending &ndash; A 40% increase during his time in the legislature.<br />\r\n\t&bull; Requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks.<br />\r\n\t&bull; Billions in new taxes and fees.<br />\r\n\t&bull; Voting to accept Obama stimulus money.&quot;</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe earmark claim caught our eye. Hasner, elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2002,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/sections/Representatives/details.aspx?MemberId=4280\">served as majority leader&nbsp;</a>from 2008-10 before term limits ended his run. That means plenty of time to rack up requests for pet projects. But did he request &quot;over $92.2 million in earmarks&quot;? And if he did, how did that compare with requests by other lawmakers?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA more detailed look at Hasner&rsquo;s record at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.georgeforflorida.com/2011/08/01/1294/\">GeorgeForFlorida.com</a>&nbsp;clarifies the LeMieux campaign was talking about Florida&rsquo;s twist on the earmark, the &quot;Community Budget Issue Request.&quot; As we&rsquo;ve written in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/nov/16/steven-schale/marco-rubio-wasnt-always-against-earmarks-florida/\">other &quot;earmark&quot; fact-checks</a>, it&rsquo;s a way state legislators use to request funding for local projects. Lawmakers had to file requests &mdash; for a local park, say, or a new community wastewater system &mdash; and attach their names to each one.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Legislature&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article1004617.ece\">stopped the practice</a>&nbsp;in 2009 as budgets got tighter.

Marti Coley, R-Marianna,</a>&nbsp;who wanted $202.3 million for projects in her district &mdash; nearly four times Hasner&rsquo;s total.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA couple of other notes.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we feel we should at least mention that LeMieux has a record of voting for earmarks while he was in the U.S. Senate. LeMieux, who&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state/article1031792.ece\">hadn&rsquo;t held elected office</a>&nbsp;before he was appointed to U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez&rsquo;s seat in 2009 by his former boss, Gov. Charlie Crist, has claimed he&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/may/12/george-lemieux/emigeorge-lemieux-claims-he-never-requested-single/\">never requested a single earmark</a>. But he didn&rsquo;t have to: Earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez.&nbsp;LeMieux voted for <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/george-lemieux-sends-mixed-messages-on-spending-earmarks/1169947\">several such bills</a>. He also actively&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/george-lemieux-sends-mixed-messages-on-spending-earmarks/1169947\">lobbied for local stimulus projects</a>. Later, he voted for a moratorium to ban federal earmarks through 2013 &mdash; but so did Sen. Bill Nelson.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, as the Florida economy faltered, Hasner cut his own local funding requests in 2008 to a single item &mdash; $385,000. That put him last among more than 100 lawmakers who made local funding requests. And he was in the leadership when the decision was made to stop such requests altogether. Hasner&rsquo;s campaign, for the record, thinks it&rsquo;s unfair to call Community Budget Issue Requests &quot;<a href=\"http://factchecked.org/2009/dictionary/earmarks/\">earmarks</a>,&quot; which campaign spokesman Douglass Mayer said evokes last-minute congressional handshake deals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The difference here is transparency,&quot; Mayer said. &quot;CBIRs are submitted with full accountability and voted on in the light of day. Earmarks are snuck in the backdoor of the federal budget process to avoid accountability.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut CBIRs are often referred to as Florida&rsquo;s version of the earmark, and documentation from the LeMieux campaign makes the reference clear.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere does this leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeMieux&rsquo;s campaign says that &quot;(Adam) Hasner&rsquo;s record includes &hellip; requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks.&quot; On the numbers, LeMieux is right -- from 2003-08 Hasner requested $92.2 million for projects through a process called Community Budget Issue Requests. But we think there are a couple of caveats worth noting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst is the CBIR process itself -- which was open and transparent. Legislators made requests for dollars in writing and were forced to explain what the money would be used for. Second, it&#39;s important to note that Hasner wasn&#39;t particularly aggressive in requesting money through CBIRs and more than 100 House members asked for more than he did in 2008. Lastly, it strikes us as hypocritical for LeMieux to attack competitors over earmarks when his own record &mdash; where it exists &mdash; shows votes and personal lobbying for local spending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate this claim Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-08T10:23:53.989024", "ruling_date": "2011-08-08T13:36:22", "ruling_headline": "George LeMieux attacks Adam Hasner's \"over $92.2 million in earmarks\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "george-lemieux-attacks-adam-hasners-over-922-milli", "ruling_link_text": "Most Florida lawmakers asked for even more", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGeorgeForFlorida.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.georgeforflorida.com/2011/08/01/adam-hasners-masquerade-ball/\">Adam Hasner&rsquo;s Masquerade Ball</a>,&quot; Aug. 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Brian Seitchik, campaign manager for George LeMieux, Aug. 4, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLeMieux campaign spreadsheet, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/230247-adam-hasners-community-budget-issue-requests.html\" id=\"bef5\" title=\"Hasner Requested Over $92.2 Million in Community Budget Issue Requests, The Florida Legislature's Version Of The Earmark\">Hasner Requested Over $92.2 Million in Community Budget Issue Requests, The Florida Legislature&#39;s Version Of The Earmark</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 4, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Douglass Mayer, spokesman for Adam Hasner, Aug. 4-5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida House of Representatives,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/sections/Representatives/details.aspx?MemberId=4280\">Rep.
