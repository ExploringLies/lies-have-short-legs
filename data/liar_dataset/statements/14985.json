He looked back to his pledge in 2017 to &quot;extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to data from IHS Markit, a private defense and security research firm, the area controlled by the Islamic State went from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 6,759 square kilometers in January 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a 93 percent reduction in territory, which is pretty close to 100 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sRwRE10FItmQ8zSAARzMwN5-cnTux697jLrnJyjKQN1KALSsnIby41sUdFpJp5vtX0zMLq5Eq37ecFWEJPAZB756cilK4xOonPsGMlDPEKYiLCH6MUVSZaR744PhL2oxiLJtG0st\" style=\"border:none; height:371px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump&rsquo;s emphasis on the one-year time frame and territory &quot;just recently held&quot; by the Islamic State pushes his claim a bit. If that means since he took office, then the Islamic State&rsquo;s losses are closer to 89 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The success Trump described built upon strategy and attacks launched under President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to <a href=\"http://www.afcent.af.mil/Portals/82/Documents/Airpower%20summary/Airpower%20Summary%20-%20November%202017.pdf\">U.S. Air Force Central Command</a> data, coalition forces engaged the enemy over 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and November 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three fourths of the action took place during the Obama years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Air Force reports over 104,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. About two-thirds of that came before Trump took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jan/18/fact-checking-donald-trumps-results-his-fake-news-/\">told PolitiFact</a> in January that Trump devolved more authority to the tactical level on the battlefield, which sped up U.S. operations and produced &quot;a real shift &hellip; that contributed to ISIS&#39;s precipitous collapse in mid 2017.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that after one year, coalition forces had freed almost 100 percent of the territory just recently held by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to data from a private defense and security group, the Islamic State controls 93 percent less terrority today than it did at the start of 2015, and 89 percent less since Trump took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fight against the Islamic State began two years before Trump became commander in chief, and the radical militant group saw significant territorial losses by the end of 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His words link the most recent gains too closely to actions taken during his time in office.
