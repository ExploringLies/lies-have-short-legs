In <a href=\"http://www2.turnto10.com/news/10_news_conference/\" title=\"a half-hour interview\">an interview</a> <font><font>aired </font></font>Aug. 7 on WJAR-TV, EDC Executive Director Keith Stokes was asked whether the loan guarantee is a good investment for the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In the case of 38 Studios, we looked at this company very carefully,&quot; Stokes said. &quot;One of the challenges we&#39;ve had is that this industry, video gaming, is a fairly new industry but it&#39;s a very fast growth trajectory industry. We hired a series of national analysts to come in to look at -- not only 38 Studios as a company and their particular business model and their particular product that they were offering to the marketplace -- but we also looked at the industry in total. One of the things we found very clearly and consistently is that it is a growth industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith most people hurting in the recession, we wondered whether the growth was clear and consistent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMelissa Chambers, senior communications manager for the EDC, sent us a <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/politics/politifact/2010/38%20StudiosRHEDC.ppt\" title=\"Powerpoint presentation\">PowerPoint presentation</a> made by Wells Fargo Securities, dated June 14, 2010, showing the growth in the interactive game software industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt said that worldwide software sales increased from $25.4 billion in 2006 to $46.6 billion in 2008, and predicted a whopping 28-percent jump in 2009. In North America alone, 2009 sales would go up by 23 percent, to $24.4 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut then we found some other sales numbers -- including actual numbers for 2009 -- that made us wonder about Stokes&#39; statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLess than a week after Stokes&#39; TV interview, the Entertainment Software Association, an industry group for developers of video and computer games for consoles, personal computers and the <font><font>Internet</font></font>, <a href=\"http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/VideoGames21stCentury_2010.pdf\" title=\"released a sales report\">released a sales report</a> showing that the amount spent on games in the United States <em>dropped </em>by about $1.2 billion in 2009, going from $11.7 billion to $10.5 billion. That&#39;s a decline of 10.3 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen we found a <a href=\"http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2007.pdf\" title=\"previous Software Association report\">previous Software Association report</a> on U.S. sales showing a dip in 2005, when consumer spending on games dropped by about $400 million, to $7 billion. The dip wasn&#39;t reflected in the Wells Fargo report, which begins with 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause the United States makes up the bulk of the North American market, we wanted to find out why Wells Fargo&#39;s 2009 positive sales projections seemed so far from the actual sales numbers reported by the ESA.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the EDC for <em>all&nbsp;</em> the reports it has received that might be relevant to the issue, hoping to find out whether the U.S. numbers reflected a worldwide trend. The corporation sent us <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/politics/politifact/Game%20Cluster%20Report.ppt\" title=\"another Powerpoint presentation\">another PowerPoint presentation</a>, this one from Strategy Analytics, based in Newton, Mass. It didn&#39;t contain any numbers that seemed relevant, so we contacted the firm directly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJia Wu, a digital media analyst for Strategy, confirmed that U.S. and North American sales for video and online games declined by more than 2 percent in 2009. Worldwide sales, he said, rose by just two thirds of 1 percent, going from $46.2 billion to $46.5 billion. That&#39;s a far cry from the 28 percent <font>worldwide jump </font>Wells Fargo predicted for 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen we heard from Lewis Ward, research manager of gaming at International Data Corporation, which also tracks worldwide software game sales, who said that his figures showed a 5-percent decline in in 2009.<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 217, 102);\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also found two reports from February -- four months before Wells Fargo presented its rosy 2009 projections to the EDC -- showing that 2009 was a rough year for the industry. <a href=\"http://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_100203a.html\" id=\"zm..\" title=\"One\">One</a> was from three video game sales tracking companies reporting that overall software sales in the <font><font>United States</font></font>, United Kingdom and Japanese markets dropped by 8 percent. <a href=\"https://www.strategyanalytics.com/default.aspx?mod=PressReleaseViewer&amp;a0=4862\" id=\"pnnn\" title=\"The other\">The other</a> was a Feb. 19, 2010, press release from Strategy Analytics stating that &quot;2009 was a tough year for video game publishers.&quot; In addition, the Strategy Analytics PowerPoint the EDC gave us notes, under the category of &quot;Mitigating risk factors,&quot; that &quot;Game industry does have cycles.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the numbers differ from analyst to analyst, the overall theme is contrary to the assertion Stokes made on Channel 10.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the EDC to put us in touch with its Wells Fargo representative. They said they weren&#39;t able to provide an analyst to speak with us and, instead, sent us to Fred Hashway, the EDC&#39;s director of government affairs and policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said it really doesn&#39;t matter if sales declined in 2009 because &quot;the individual year is irrelevant&quot; to what EDC considers to be more important -- the long-term trend. Wells Fargo&#39;s &quot;forecasting ability is still excellent. You don&#39;t look at it at one year. You look at it over a period of time.&quot; Wells Fargo is predicting good things for the industry<font color=\"#000000\"><font>, he said.</font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHashway also said any 2005 U.S. sales dip is &quot;a distinction without a difference&quot; for the same reason -- broader trends are more important. &quot;<font>I think we went back as far as we n</font><font>eeded to.&quot;</font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy all accounts, the video gaming industry has grown substantially since the 1990s, topping more than $46 billion worldwide. But the sharp drop in U.S. sales in 2005 and 2009, combined with last year&#39;s minimal increase in global sales -- or decline, depending on who&#39;s giving you the numbers -- show that, at least for those years, the growth in the industry has not been consistent. Strategy Analytics, in its report to the EDC projecting double-digit growth over the next five years for the type of game 38 Studios plans to develop, noted as much.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStokes could have said that the overall trend in the video gaming business has been strongly upward despite a downturn or two. But he didn&#39;t. He said growth in the industry was clear and consistent. So we rate his comment as Barely True.</p>\r\n\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
