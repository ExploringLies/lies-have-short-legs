Oregon launched his groundbreaking health plan in 1994 when the state got special waivers from the federal government to change the way it handles Medicaid, the health insurance for the nation&rsquo;s poorest people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder Oregon&rsquo;s plan, the state limits the services Medicaid pays for, with an emphasis on providing preventive and ongoing medical care. By limiting what services are offered, Oregon was able to expand the number of people who were covered. Kitzhaber came up with the idea and championed it during his years as a state senator and governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the plan launched in 1994, about 350,000 Oregonians were eligible. According to an official history of the plan published by the state, 250,000 already had Medicaid coverage. The expansion added 100,000 Oregonians who, until then, didn&rsquo;t have health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToday the health plan covers 523,000 Oregonians. About 20 percent of them wouldn&rsquo;t be getting health insurance if not for the plan&rsquo;s expanded Medicaid provisions. But the plan has struggled because of budget constraints and over the years cut back the number of people who are covered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKitzhaber, a Democrat now seeking a third term as governor, talks proudly of his plan. On Aug. 15, 2010, in an interview on KQEN AM in Roseburg, he assessed the plan this way:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The health plan I think in many respects has been a big success. Over 2 million Oregonians have received important medical services because of it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered about the &quot;2 million&quot; figure in a state that today has a population of 3.8 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCampaign spokeswoman Jillian Schoene says the number comes from the Oregon Department of Human Services, which oversees the health plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we checked with the folks at the Oregon Health Plan. Sean Kolmer, the deputy administrator for the health plan&rsquo;s office of policy and research, says the 2 million includes people who have been enrolled in the health plan at any time since 1994. He points out many people have come into the plan and left it over the years. &nbsp;He says the tally doesn&rsquo;t double count. &quot;Those are unique individuals,&quot; he says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the second part of Kitzhaber&rsquo;s statement doesn&rsquo;t hold up. Note that Kitzhaber told his radio listeners the 2 million health plan participants got coverage &quot;because of it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith this cause-and-effect claim, Kitzhaber is saying the 2 million wouldn&rsquo;t have received &quot;important medical services&quot; if his health plan hadn&rsquo;t existed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that&rsquo;s not true. The majority of people in the plan would have had coverage under Medicaid anyway, and still would if the plan vanished tomorrow.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow many of the 2 million would have received health coverage if the plan hadn&rsquo;t existed? We asked the folks at the health plan and, at our request, they did a count.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe answer: Kolmer says that 59 percent of those folks would have received Medicaid coverage anyway. That means 41 percent got coverage because of Kitzhaber&rsquo;s health plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKitzhaber is indeed the creator of the Oregon Health Plan and -- as the records shows -- he can legitimately claim credit for expanding health coverage to about 820,000 people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTaking credit for the entire 2 million is a stretch. We find his claim Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/09/politifact_oregon_was_kitzh.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-23T16:13:55.862342", "ruling_date": "2010-09-24T11:41:24", "ruling_headline": "John Kitzhaber says 2 million people got health care coverage because of his Oregon Health Plan", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-kitzhaber-says-2-million-people-got-health-ca", "ruling_link_text": "Except for more than a million who would have been covered anyway", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJohn Kitzhaber Interview, <a href=\"http://www.541radio.com/play_window.php?audioType=Episode&amp;audioId=4868766\">KQEN-AM</a>, August 15, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState of Oregon Department of Human Services, <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthplan/data_pubs/ohpoverview0706.pdf\">Oregon Health Plan: An Historical Overview</a>, July 2006<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState of Oregon Department of Human Services, <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthplan/data_pubs/quarterly/q2010/1qtr10-cmsrprt.pdf\">Oregon Health Plan 2 Quarterly Report</a>, 1st quarter, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Jillian Schoene of <a href=\"http://www.johnkitzhaber.com/\">John Kitzhaber for Governor</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Sean Kolmer of the <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthplan/\">Oregon Health Plan</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Governor of Oregon", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "John ", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 691, "last_name": "Kitzhaber", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-kitzhaber", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/kitzhaber41.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/691/", "total_count": 14, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.johnkitzhaber.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays more than 2 million Oregonians have received important medical services because of his health plan.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio interview", "statement_date": "2010-08-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
