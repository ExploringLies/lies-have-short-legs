The others candidate want to leave residual forces in Iraq to be on hand for peacekeeping purposes or in case terrorists mount an offensive. Richardson says a small force will be ineffective, and all troops should come home.\n</p>\n<p>\n But we feel compelled to point out that Richardson's poll numbers have never put him in league with Clinton, Obama or Edwards. A Sept. 16 Gallup Poll showed him with 5 percent support, a good six points shy of Edwards' 11 percent, and well behind Clinton and Obama. That leaves Richardson in the single digits, along with Sen. Joe Biden and Rep. Dennis Kucinich.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of those two rivals, Richardson's position is not significantly different from Kucinich on questions of withdrawal and timetables. Kucinich advocates a prompt withdrawal of U.S. troops to be replaced with international peace keepers. Biden, on the other hand, has proposed an elaborate plan for partitioning Iraq into self-governing regions with U.S. troops helping maintain order.\n</p>\n<p>\n We won't take any points off for Richardson's claim to be among the \"major\" candidates here, but we will lower his Truth-O-Meter rating because the other candidates have not said they want troops in Iraq indefinitely, as Richardson suggests. Instead, they have said they need the information a commander-in-chief gets to make a final decision on force levels in Iraq. It may be a fine distinction, but it's not the same thing as supporting an indefinite deployment.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:36.756836", "ruling_date": "2007-09-23T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Richardson wants all troops out", "ruling_headline_slug": "richardson-wants-all-troops-out", "ruling_link_text": "Richardson wants all troops out", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Bill Richardson:\n<a href=\"http://www.richardsonforpresident.com/issues/iraq\">\n Campaign Web site on Iraq.\n</a>\n<p>\n Transcript, Democratic Presidential debate on MSNBC, Sept. 26, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/index.html,\">\n  Social Security Trustees Report 2007\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n The Democratic candidates' positions on Iraq:\r\nHillary Clinton:\n <a href=\"http://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/iraq/\">\n  Campaign Web site on Iraq.\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Hillary Clinton:\n <a href=\"http://clinton.senate.gov/issues/nationalsecurity/iraq/\">\n  Senate Web site on Iraq.\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n John Edwards:\n <a href=\"http://johnedwards.com/issues/iraq/\">\n  Campaign Web site on Iraq.\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Barack Obama:\n <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/\">\n  Campaign Web site on Iraq.\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Barack Obama:\n <a href=\"http://obama.senate.gov/issues/iraq/\">\n  Senate Web site on Iraq.\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Barack Obama:\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/politics/20070912obama_iraq.pdf\">\n  Sept. 12, 2007 position paper on Iraq.\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "New Mexico", "id": 6, "last_name": "Richardson", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "bill-richardson", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Richardson_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/6/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.billrichardson.com/"}, "statement": "\"Bill Richardson is the only major Democratic candidate with a plan to withdraw all American troops from Iraq.
