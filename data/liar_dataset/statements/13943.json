A casting call for extras will reportedly take place in the Jacksonville area in a couple of months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were intrigued, and broke out a box of tissues just in case the tears started flowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be too crazy of an announcement. Sequels are all the rage in Hollywood these days, and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has said he wants to bring back the state&rsquo;s tax credit for film projects &ndash; a campaign promise we&rsquo;ve rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/promises/coop-o-meter/promise/1338/restore-film-tax-credits/\">In The Works</a> on our Coop-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, Nicholas Sparks &ndash; author of &quot;The Notebook&quot; and other popular books &ndash; lives in New Bern, not far from Jacksonville. Many of his books are set in North Carolina, and a few of the film versions have been shot here, too, including &quot;A Walk To Remember,&quot; &quot;Safe Haven&quot; and &quot;The Longest Ride.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s official tourism bureau even has a guide for a three-day trip around eastern North Carolina, which it calls <a href=\"https://www.visitnc.com/trip-idea/a-nicholas-sparks-tour-of-the-north-carolina-coast\">&quot;A Nicholas Sparks Tour of the North Carolina Coast.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Sparks has written a sequel to The Notebook, which is called <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3466.The_Wedding\">The Wedding</a> and hasn&rsquo;t been made into a movie &ndash; yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stars seemed to align for this rumor.

Department of Commerce, which oversees the N.C. Film Office, said there was no Notebook 2 project anywhere in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Film Office is not working on/with any &quot;Notebook 2&quot; project,&quot; Commerce Department spokesman David Rhoades said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, there isn&rsquo;t a sequel to The Notebook being filmed in North Carolina.
