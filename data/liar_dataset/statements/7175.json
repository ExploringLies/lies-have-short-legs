Charlie Crist has the Florida political world buzzing about a potential face-off with Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott&rsquo;s response to the hypothetical <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/static/insite/login.html?goto=http%3A//www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/02/3123672/prelude-to-2014.html\">showdown</a>&nbsp;with the Republican-turned-independent-turned Democrat has been simple: Avoid direct comment but point out how Florida hemorrhaged jobs under Crist&rsquo;s watch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The four years before I became governor, the state had lost 825,000 jobs. Unemployment had gone from 3.5 percent to 11.1 percent. We incurred another $5.2 billion, I think, worth of debt,&quot; Scott said at a <a href=\"http://thefloridachannel.org/video/121112-press-availability-with-governor-rick-scott/\">Dec. 11, 2012, news conference</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe thought his talking points about Florida&rsquo;s economy under Crist merited a fact-check. It probably won&rsquo;t be the last time Scott takes a dig at his predecessor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this item, we&#39;ll examine Scott&rsquo;s claims about the unemployed under Crist. We will examine the debt claim in a separate item.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has addressed similar jobs claims <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/14/barack-obama/obama-attacks-romney-over-40000-lost-manufacturing/\">about</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/06/tom-barrett/dem-recall-candidate-tom-barrett-says-gop-wisconsi/\">governors</a> in many states. We often find the numbers are right but the blame is exaggerated. The impact of a governor on a state&rsquo;s economic health is usually pretty small, experts say.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Jobless ranks swelled</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott&rsquo;s math on the number of jobs Florida lost during Crist&rsquo;s tenure is correct if you compare the month before his inauguration (December 2006) with his last month in office (December 2010).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida&rsquo;s workforce contracted from 8,043,000 non-farm workers to 7,217,500 -- a loss of 825,500 jobs, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjR_9M-1WtJTdEN2ODFlZk4ycDNTMmJiQ2ZtWGRSSWc\">Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state lost half of its construction jobs during that period, shrinking from 668,600 to 336,400.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott has touted the state&rsquo;s declining unemployment rate under his tenure as a sign of economic improvement. (But a rapidly declining rate is not always worth bragging about, as we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/sep/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-brags-about-floridas-declining-unemploy/\">noted in this fact-check</a>, because it has been the sign of a shrinking workforce as a result of discouraged workers giving up on finding jobs in the state.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no denying Florida&rsquo;s employment situation went from robust to bleak under Crist. In December 2006, the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate was 3.5 percent. (Remember those days?!) In December 2010, the rate was 11.1 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&#39;s unemployment rate has inched down in the months since Scott took office. The most recent rate was <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm\">8.5 percent in October 2012</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Whose fault is it?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMark Vitner, Wells Fargo senior economist, said assessing who is responsible when thing go bad -- or when they improve -- is a difficult task. The more pertinent question, he said, is &quot;What policy action did you try to take to try to mitigate the economic recession or engender an economic recovery?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Whether it was luck or whatever, during his tenure Florida&rsquo;s economy sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked Scott&#39;s press office for examples of how Crist played a role in Florida&#39;s economic downturn. Scott spokesman John Tupps wrote in an email, &quot;Florida&#39;s economic improvement and job creation under Gov. Scott is undeniable.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody&rsquo;s Analytics who studies Florida, said Crist is not responsible for the state&rsquo;s economic decline because &quot;the seeds of destruction&quot; had already been sown by the time he took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHome sales and prices had already peaked in 2005 and 2006. Behind the scenes lurked a number of major issues: mortgage lending to borrowers who couldn&rsquo;t afford to repay their loans and Wall Street bankers buying those loans and selling them to investors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&rsquo;t remember hearing about states in 2004 taking a stand against home building,&quot; said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida. &quot;It was bringing in revenue. There was a lot of benefits that the boom side of the housing market created. There were significant costs when we went into bust.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdded Lafakis: &quot;That had very very little to do with Charlie Crist.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\f<br />\r\n\tThe onset of the housing crisis, coupled with the state&rsquo;s dependence on a constant flow of new residents, meant Florida suffered more than other states, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe wealth of out-of-state retirees &quot;was eviscerated&quot; during the recession, he said, making them less able to retire in Florida. And working-age people faced either reduced job opportunities in major metro areas like Tampa and Orlando or could not sell their homes and relocate here, Lafakis said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Would it have been different with someone else in office?&quot; Lafakis said. &quot;The wheels were already in motion. He (Crist) suffered from the worst timing that you could pick.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd unlike the federal government, the state government cannot run deficits in an effort to stimulate the economy because of balanced budget requirements. States basically &quot;have to ride it out,&quot; Snaith said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott is right about the grim jobless figures: The state&rsquo;s employment picture worsened almost as soon as Crist became governor and did not let up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Scott misses the mark for implying the state&rsquo;s recession was the result of a poor handling by Crist. Florida&rsquo;s economy tanked largely as a result of the housing market crisis, a tornado of issues over which Crist had little to no control.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Scott&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em><strong>Update:</strong> This fact-check was updated shortly after publication to include comment from the governor&#39;s office.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-12-14T11:26:51.301011", "ruling_date": "2012-12-14T13:59:06", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott says Florida's economy soured under Charlie Crist", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-says-floridas-economy-soured-under-char", "ruling_link_text": "A bad time to govern", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Mark Vitner, Wells Fargo senior economist, Dec. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody&rsquo;s Analytics, Dec. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida, Dec. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-democrats-are-blame-private-se/\">Chris Christie says Democrats are to blame for private-sector job losses from 2000-2009 by increasing taxes, regulation and state spending,</a>&quot;
