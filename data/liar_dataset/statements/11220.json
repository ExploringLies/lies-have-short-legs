But the former San Antonio mayor and Democratic vice presidential prospect also let it be known that work remains to be done, especially in closing the digital socio-economic divide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an anniversary <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/speeches_remarks_statements/2015/Remarks_072715\">speech</a> otherwise trumpeting anti-homelessness programs and public housing developments, Castro said: &quot;Technology has transformed how we live, learn and work, but not everyone has been able to participate in these developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Less than half of the poorest American households have a home internet subscription,&quot; Castro said, which poses barriers when most college applications and job openings are handled over the web. Castro went on to describe the agency&rsquo;s new ConnectHome project, which he said would accelerate broadband adoption, helping up to 200,000 children gain high-speed online access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious about his &quot;less than half&quot; claim relating poverty and home Internet connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Castro cites White House report</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding to our request for elaboration, Castro&rsquo;s press secretary, Cameron French, emailed us a web link to a July 15, 2015, White House &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_connect_home_fact_sheet.pdf\">fact sheet</a>&quot; stating that an analysis that day by the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/about\">Council of Economic Advisers</a>, which advises the president on economic policy, &quot;illustrates that some Americans are still unable to benefit from high-speed broadband, especially America&rsquo;s lower-income children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In fact, while nearly two-thirds of households in the lowest-income quintile own a computer,&quot; the White House document said, &quot;less than half have a home Internet subscription. While many middle-class U.S. students go home to Internet access, allowing them to do research, write papers, and communicate digitally with their teachers and other students, too many lower-income children go unplugged every afternoon when school ends. This &lsquo;homework gap&rsquo; runs the risk of widening the achievement gap, denying hard-working students the benefit of a technology-enriched education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The council&rsquo;s analysis, a 10-page report titled <a href=\"http://go.wh.gov/es37iR\">&quot;Mapping the Digital Divide,&quot;</a> said that according to the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2013 American Community Survey, &quot;less than half of households headed by someone who did not graduate high school had a home Internet connection, compared to over 90 percent of households headed by a college graduate.&quot; The bureau <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/\">says</a> it annually conducts the survey to help Americans understand changes &quot;taking place in their communities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also presented a chart suggesting high-income Americans widely have home Internet access:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"PUMA.PNG\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RifWVW7ByEgpA1dwNmZC7ZOLWYk7_SkixoKfbOXho3vcIXnZ6mRTq7bkpXseIhq4MnhH7IFz-T3IFBXc9dyzHzp9LmS8jx62QNPelMbWKSr9fCUOQvcTPR9bTSf2aQqzheSsVgI\" style=\"border:none; height:278px; width:346px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>U.S. Census Bureau research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Castro didn&rsquo;t say he was limiting his &quot;less than half&quot; statement to households headed by non-high school graduates. To our follow-up email, French said the council drew on a census bureau report based on the 2013 ACS, titled &quot;Computer and Internet Use in the United States: 2013.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bureau report cited specific questions in the survey asking if, in the household, there is access to computers, access to smartphones and a working Internet subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Census.PNG\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UwBMwJyMt_P6D5VACoRXp0pokQ_rxhU43FVGzW-ngTje3juxf7265WLGbRCkKiJC_zAdZRC8gtjDYmYI2wzj0_5AkTmH7HzZY848e9f06VA0tWWQao7OAj9Lq8vRY6wuCj8Yfqg\" style=\"border:none; height:613px; width:302px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors then broke out the results by race, education and household income. Upshot: Slightly less than half of the lowest of five income groups &mdash; 48.4 percent of households bringing in less than $25,000 a year &mdash; reported having Internet access. Households with greater incomes reported home Internet subscription rates of 69 percent to 95 percent, the report said. Some 47.2 percent of the lowest-income households had high-speed web connections, according to the report, with higher-income households reporting high-speech connection rates of 68 percent to 95 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Census table.PNG\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3XqqjrQ0cskffG1IBwi5NpRanQpjM3XBPza-qv2Gqyf_KdYs8kMDkaAQdKL37uR9-h7wazemAOlbC9LmuQDmuTRbhuG2w2H156jbWtiAN7pZ-Z0WOcZLdeO02PWoqm7MaulZAVY\" style=\"border:none; height:645px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we sought other relevant research, landing a September 2013 poll of U.S. residents by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center asking adults if they used broadband Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, Pew said, 70 percent of the surveyed residents reported broadband connections at home. But that didn&rsquo;t hold across income categories. In contrast to the bureau, Pew separated annual income levels into four categories: less than $30,000, between $30,000 and $49,999, $50,000 to $74,999, and $75,000 or more. Pew said 52 percent of adults in the lowest-income group said they had broadband access at home &mdash; compared with 71 percent to 91 percent of higher-income adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pew research center.PNG\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yICasncd5l5mnxFQG3sM0Yt2rlcYvd17PtFolImTnZGqxu17If8keKj94XJdYoVz32AwMDvyAy6jK7o6IuEpBkoIQ-b3vSXI1-onk5n0RY1O4_JmiWsKiumNYQn1hPDplmApfYM\" style=\"border:none; height:638px; width:540px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/\">Pew said</a> in a September 2013 web post that as of that May, 15 percent of American adults did not use the Internet or email. &quot;Groups that are significantly more likely to rely on internet access outside the home include blacks and Hispanics, as well as adults at lower levels of income and education,&quot; Pew said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Castro said that &quot;less than half of the poorest American households have a home Internet subscription.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 48 percent of the nation&rsquo;s poorest quintile of households--the bottom 20 percent--reported a home Internet connection in 2013.
