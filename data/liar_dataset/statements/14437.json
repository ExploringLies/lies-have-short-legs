The full $3 billion would be paid only if the plant Foxconn plans to put in Wisconsin creates 13,000 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is it possible that the Foxconn offer could end up costing Wisconsin taxpayers more than $1 million per job?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new $1 million-per-job claim was made by another Democratic lawmaker, state Senate Minority Leader <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/jennifer-shilling/\">Jennifer Shilling</a> of La Crosse, on Aug. 14, 2017. The same day, the $3 billion incentive package cleared its first legislative hurdle, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/14/3-billion-wisconsin-foxconn-incentives-up-first-vote-monday/564455001/\">winning &nbsp;approval</a> from a Republican-controlled Assembly committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shilling made her claim in a <a href=\"https://jwyjh41vxje2rqecx3efy4kf-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170814ShillingFoxconn.pdf\">news release</a> about the $3 billion that carried this headline: &quot;Foxconn tax break could exceed $1 million per job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s crunch the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The $3 billion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has pledged to invest up to $10 billion on a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing facility that would employ at least 3,000 people, and up to 13,000. In turn, Wisconsin has offered the company up to $3 billion in incentives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already reported that based on the best available data, <a href=\"https://walker.wi.gov/sites/default/files/Foxconn%20MOU.pdf\">Wisconsin&rsquo;s offer</a> would be the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/15/one-wisconsin-now/wisconsins-3-billion-offer-foxconn-gift-and-it-lar/\">largest incentive</a> ever provided by a state to a foreign company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to think about the $3 billion in three parts -- a $2.85 billion in essentially cash payments and the rest in a sales tax exemption:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Up to $1.35 billion in tax credits paid to Foxconn if the company invests at least $9 billion in the plant</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Up to $1.5 billion in payments if Foxconn creates 13,000 jobs</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>$150 million in sales tax exemptions</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the more the company spends on capital and payroll, the more cash it gets from Wisconsin taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shilling&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shilling bases her claim on Foxconn making the full capital investment -- but employing only 1,000 people. Here is her math:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The $9 billion capital investment would bring Foxconn a $1.35 billion payment</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>1,000 jobs -- with what the company says would be for an average salary of $53,876, and the jobs last for 15 years -- would bring another $137 million</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>That totals $1.49 billion in tax credit payments. Divide that by 1,000 jobs and you get $1.49 million per job.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/author/jpeacock\">Jon Peacock</a>, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, and <a href=\"https://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/media/1153/duties-and-organization-of-the-bureau.pdf\">Bob Lang</a>, director of the nonpartisan state&nbsp;Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed to us that Shilling&rsquo;s math is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Peacock, who has done <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Foxconn-payments-for-jobs.pdf\">an analysis</a> on Wisconsin&rsquo;s offer to Foxconn, told us that even if 1,500 jobs were created, the cost to taxpayers would still exceed $1 million per job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Shilling is doing some cherry picking. She is taking Foxconn at its word that it will invest at least $9 billion, but rejecting the company&rsquo;s pledge that it will create at least 3,000 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a large investment with relatively few jobs results in a higher per-job cost to taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, it&rsquo;s not clear that Foxconn would invest $9 billion or more in a plant that would employ only 1,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://wisconsintechnologycouncil.com/contact/\">Tom Still</a>, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, insisted to us that &quot;no company would invest anything close to $10 billion&quot; to create only 1,000 or 1,500 jobs. &quot;It just wouldn&rsquo;t make economic sense. You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to produce enough to recoup the investment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wmc.org/about/staff/scott-manley-vice-president-of-government-relations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Manley</a>, a senior vice president at Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, echoed Still&rsquo;s analysis. He said that based on Foxconn&rsquo;s plans to spend $10 billion on a plant that eventually would employ 13,000 people, WMC estimates the company would spend only $769.2 million on the plant if the plant only employed 1,000 people. He said that comes out to $252,000 per job, based on the tax credits the company would collect for its investment and payroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, it simply isn&rsquo;t known yet how much Foxconn will spend on capital or on payroll -- leaving the amount of incentives to be paid up in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How many jobs?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://walker.wi.gov/sites/default/files/Foxconn%20MOU.pdf\">memorandum of understanding</a> it signed with the state, Foxconn has pledged to invest up to $10 billion in its plant. And it <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foxconn-announces-launch-of-intelligent-manufacturing-ecosystem-in-us-during-white-house-event-300494861.html\">has said</a> it would initially employ 3,000 people, with the potential to employ 13,000. (We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-foxconn-bringing-13000-jobs-wisc/\">rated Half True</a> a claim by Republican Gov. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/\">Scott Walker</a> that Foxconn &quot;is bringing&quot; 13,000 jobs.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the agreement has no minimums on capital investment or hiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. told us it is negotiating a contract with Foxconn &quot;that will outline annual benchmarks that will need to be met in order for the company to access, and retain, these tax credits.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s worth noting the plant is expected to create thousands of construction jobs and spinoff jobs. But the state&rsquo;s $3 billion incentives offer applies only to the factory itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shilling said about a $3 billion incentive package being offered by the State of Wisconsin: &quot;Foxconn tax break could exceed $1 million per job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found in a previous fact check that the state would not be paying Foxconn $3 billion for 3,000 jobs -- or $1 million per job -- because the full $3 billion would be paid only if 13,000 jobs are created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Shilling&rsquo;s favor, if Foxconn invests at least $9 billion in its plant as it has said it will -- but hires only 1,500 workers -- the incentives paid would exceed $1 million per job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, while there is not yet a commitment that Foxconn will create a minimum number of jobs, there is also no evidence that the total would be only 1,500 jobs if it invests $9 billion in its plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-16T12:36:21.493122", "ruling_date": "2017-08-16T12:39:50", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin paying Foxconn $1 million per job possible, if not likely ", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-paying-foxconn-1-million-job-possible-if", "ruling_link_text": "Math works, but numbers cherry picked", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jennifer Shilling, <a href=\"https://jwyjh41vxje2rqecx3efy4kf-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170814ShillingFoxconn.pdf\">news release</a>, Aug. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Jennifer Shilling aide Tony Palese, Aug. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/15/one-wisconsin-now/wisconsins-3-billion-offer-foxconn-gift-and-it-lar/\">&quot;Would Wisconsin&#39;s $3 billion to Foxconn be largest-ever &#39;gift&#39;
