But other clues also show that the story is bogus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no media outlet called the St. George Gazette. The website implies it is based in <a href=\"https://www.sgcity.org/\">St. George, Utah</a>, but the newspaper there is called the <a href=\"http://www.thespectrum.com/\">Spectrum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story also quoted one Paul Horner, which is the name of a big-time writer of fabricated news stories. One of his trademarks is always putting his own name into his stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Horner, formerly a writer at fake news site NationalReport.net, is credited with writing stories ranging from Bill Murray running for president to President Barack Obama opening a Muslim museum to Banksy getting arrested. You can read a <a href=\"http://newsexaminer.net/paul-horner-news/paul-horner-news-internet-news-satirist-writer-news-examiner/\">roundup of some his work </a>at NewsExaminer.net, which also is a fake news site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among his often-used calling cards in online stories are the use of the byline Jimmy Rustling, numerous references to &quot;Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin&quot; and a plea to donate socks to the homeless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The footer note posted on the bottom of the website lists a &quot;complaint department&quot; phone number that is actually the number for the controversial <a href=\"http://www.whitepages.com/business/westboro-baptist-church-topeka-ks\">Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan</a>. It&rsquo;s another Horner staple to use that number: The Ryan article cites the same number as a hotline set up by the White House for people to comment on Trump&rsquo;s resignation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s otherwise no contact information for the website. We reached out to Horner, who responded to us with a cheeky reply on Facebook, but did not address this particular story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is made up, in any case. We rate it Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-03T16:28:48.762774", "ruling_date": "2017-07-05T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Story about Ryan announcing Trump\u2019s resignation comes from infamous fake news writer", "ruling_headline_slug": "story-about-ryan-announcing-trumps-resignation-com", "ruling_link_text": "Paul Horner strikes again ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>StGeorgeGazette.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://stgeorgegazette.com/trump-plans-to-resign-within-30-days/\">Paul Ryan: &lsquo;Donald Trump Plans To Resign From Office Within The Next 30 Days&rsquo;</a>,&quot; June 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/21/this-is-not-an-interview-with-banksy/?utm_term=.1a6804493a68\">This is not an interview with Banksy</a>,&quot; Oct. 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PaulHorner.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.paulhorner.com/statement/\">Statement of Paul Horner</a>,&quot; Dec. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NewsExaminer.net, &quot;<a href=\"http://newsexaminer.net/paul-horner-news/paul-horner-news-internet-news-satirist-writer-news-examiner/\">Paul Horner: Internet News Satirist, Writer, Comedian, Performance Artist, Hoax Artist &amp; Fake News Spokesman</a>,&quot; June 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Paul Horner, StGeorgeGazette.com writer, July 2, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3988, "last_name": "StGeorgeGazette.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "stgeorgegazettecom", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3988/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://stgeorgegazette.com"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an Internet post", "statement_date": "2017-06-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
