(Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo was taken during a liveshot in 2008 while Cooper was in Texas covering Hurricane Ike. <a href=\"http://www.allthingsandersoncooper.com/2008/09/ike-day-after.html\">Clips of the 2008 footage</a> were posted on several blogs at the time, verifying the segment&rsquo;s age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Ike had been downgraded to a tropical storm, but there was still significant flooding in the area where Cooper was reporting. Cooper notes several times that the water is receding. At one point, he has his cameraman film a wooden pole that is still wet from when water levels were about a foot-and-a-half higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You can see the water is definitely going down,&quot; he said in the 2008 liveshot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper also said in the original liveshot that he&rsquo;s standing next to a road that is on higher ground than most of the area and is being used for evacuations. He points out that there is a drop-off from the road to the surrounding area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his fact-checking segment, Cooper said his camera crew was standing near the road to keep the camera equipment dry. He also said he was not standing on the road because he did not want to hinder the evacuation efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Thomas, a long-time CNN audio technician, was the cameraman seen in the viral photo. He died in September 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This photo comes from 2008 coverage of Hurricane Ike. Cooper repeatedly shows the range of water depth in the liveshot and is not on his knees or in a ditch. Because the photo is from 2008, the liveshot was not taken to &quot;make @realDonaldTrump look bad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-18T12:49:03.590595", "ruling_date": "2018-09-18T13:16:56", "ruling_headline": "Misleading 2008 Anderson Cooper photo used as \u2018proof\u2019 of fake Hurricane Florence coverage", "ruling_headline_slug": "hoax-uses-2008-anderson-cooper-photo-proof-fake-hu", "ruling_link_text": "A flood of falsehoods", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump Jr.,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1041310008623943680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1041310008623943680%7Ctwgr%5E363937393b636f6e74726f6c&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fmorning-mix%2Fwp%2F2018%2F09%2F18%2Fanderson-cooper-accuses-donald-trump-jr-of-tweeting-lies-with-old-hurricane-photo%2F\"> tweet</a>, Sept. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anderson Cooper 360&deg;, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AC360/status/1041855911793385472\">tweet</a>, Sept. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/politics/anderson-cooper-vs-donald-trump-jr-cnntv/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_content=2018-09-18T10:08:10\">Anderson Cooper debunks Trump Jr.&#39;s fake news claim on live television</a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynne Patton, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BnwtN8eHSGJ/?taken-by=lynnepatton\">Instagram post</a>, Sept. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AllThingsAndersonCooper.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.allthingsandersoncooper.com/2008/09/ike-day-after.html\">Ike, the day after,</a>&quot; Sept. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/18/anderson-cooper-accuses-donald-trump-jr-of-tweeting-lies-with-old-hurricane-photo/?utm_term=.68f2e0bace76\">Anderson Cooper accuses Donald Trump Jr. of &lsquo;tweeting lies&rsquo; with old hurricane photo</a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3275, "last_name": "Viral image", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "viral-image", "pants_count": 27, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Success-Kid.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3275/", "total_count": 52, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says CNN&rsquo;s Anderson Cooper stood in a ditch during Hurricane Florence to exaggerate water levels.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Facebook post", "statement_date": "2018-09-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
