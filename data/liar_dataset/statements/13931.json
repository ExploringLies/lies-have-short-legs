This seeming news post proved as fake as a <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/wookiee\">Wookiee</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Texas looked into this claim as part of the inaugural<a href=\"http://factcheckingday.com/\"> International Fact-Checking Day</a>, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as &quot;not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism and everyday life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were suspicious of the Texas-tied call for extras from launch because there&rsquo;s been no legitimate report out of Hollywood that a Star Wars movie is going to be shot in Texas. It didn&rsquo;t help that the WBN12.com post is undated or that it&rsquo;s identical, except for the place name, from a post saying the same about Las Vegas, Nev., that was <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/star-wars-filming-soon-in-your-town-usa/\">debunked by Snopes.com</a>--in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another sign the claim lacks validity? The WBN12 website includes a disclaimer stating: &quot;wbn12.com is a satirical and fantasy website. None of the articles on wbn12.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The &#39;call&#39; for Texas extras</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post, which came to our attention through PoiltiFact&rsquo;s fake-news-spotting partnership with Facebook, is datelined Rosenberg, <a href=\"https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/her02\">which is home to more than 30,000 people on U.S. 59 nearly 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It opens: &quot;Reports out of Hollywood this morning are confirming that a portion of the next Star Wars movie will be filmed near Rosenberg, Texas. The undisclosed location near Rosenberg will represent a previously unknown planet in the Star Wars universe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post continues: &quot;No details were released as to exactly when production would take place in the Rosenberg area but they stated that it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before that time period, however.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post goes on to say local fans (no one identified by name) are excited at the prospect and that producers (no one named) said in a statement: &quot;We think that Rosenberg is a great place to find the hundreds of extras for our alien population and we&rsquo;re very excited about filming here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No evidence for&nbsp;a Texas casting call</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t reach anyone directly connected to the Disney-owned Star Wars movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise a web search turned up a Dec. 22, 2016, post on the moviecastingcall.org website describing casting calls for a Han Solo anthology film including mention that filming is to take place in 2017 &quot;at the Pinewood Studios in London, England among other undisclosed locations in the United Kingdom,&quot; pretty far from Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the subhead &quot;Extras Casting,&quot; that post says: &quot;Casting calls and registration for extras will be posted here as they become available.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard back next from the owner of moviecastingcall.org, Alan Baltes, who emailed: &quot;My website posts accurate information&quot; about Disney and Marvel casting and auditions. Baltes, noting WBN12&rsquo;s disclaimer, described its post about casting for Star Wars extras near Rosenberg as one of several that&rsquo;s surfaced about the next Star Wars film getting shot in Texas. &quot;The same hoax has been posted over the years, making the same claim, but stating filming would take place in other areas of the United States,&quot; Baltes wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Rosenberg, a city spokeswoman, Jenny Pavlovich, said by phone that before our inquiry, she hadn&rsquo;t heard of local Star Wars shoots. A Fort Bend County official, Beth Wolf, said people around the courthouse had heard the Star Wars rumor though she hadn&rsquo;t encountered confirmation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wolf said by phone: &quot;You know, we don&rsquo;t have that many movies being made here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A web post said extras are being sought to participate in a new Star Wars movie being shot near Rosenberg, Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence for this claim anywhere including on wbn12.com, which counsels that none of its content &quot;should be considered true.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fair enough. We rate this fake-news statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>PANTS ON FIRE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
