Gov. David Dewhurst countered a charge that he has never cut the budget by saying he has done just that numerous times and &quot;by billions and billions of dollars.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst was responding to fellow Senate hopeful Ted Cruz, who questioned Dewhurst&rsquo;s record by saying that &quot;in (Dewhurst&rsquo;s) entire tenure in elected office, he has never once cut one penny from the state budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst replied that Cruz, a Houston lawyer, was wrongly focusing on the size of the total state budget &mdash; including state and federal funds &mdash; when he should be zeroing in on expenditures of state revenue, often called general revenue, which Dewhurst described as &quot;the only money that we can control.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Every conservative group that I have ever worked with has said, &lsquo;Governor, don&rsquo;t increase your general revenue spending more than inflation and population growth,&rsquo;&quot; Dewhurst said. &quot;Not only did we do better than that, but we have cut it 10.7 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tElsewhere, we&rsquo;re fact-checking Cruz&rsquo;s charge that Dewhurst hasn&rsquo;t cut a penny from the budget. Here, we&rsquo;ll dig into Dewhurst&rsquo;s statement that when adjusted for inflation and population growth, general revenue spending has declined nearly 11 percent while he&rsquo;s led the Senate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a note on Dewhurst&rsquo;s methodology. Limiting spending increases to the sum of inflation and population growth is advocated by small-government groups as one way to ward off what they see as excessive spending. It&rsquo;s a way to keep per-resident spending from increasing other than through inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs backup for Dewhurst&rsquo;s debate claim, his campaign sent us a spreadsheet containing details on overall state government expenditures per two-year budget period, as well as the subcategory of general revenue. The figures for the current biennium, 2012-13, are estimates. The spreadsheet also includes the historical expenditure figures adjusted for population and inflation. (The same figures are in a chart in a January 2012 <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Fiscal_Size-up/Fiscal%20Size-up%202012-13.pdf\">report</a> from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we looked at how overall spending, including state and federal funds, has changed since Dewhurst became lieutenant governor in early 2003. The estimated &quot;all funds&quot; expenditures for 2012-13 of $173 billion are nearly 50 percent greater than such spending in 2002-03, which was the last two-year budget period before Dewhurst assumed his gavel-wielding post.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, according to the report, once the 2012-13 figure is adjusted for inflation and population growth over the intervening years, &quot;all funds&quot; spending is actually down about 2.4 percent from 2002-03.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we looked at general revenue. According to the board&rsquo;s figures, the estimated 2012-13 general revenue spending level is about 36 percent greater than the 2002-03 spending level. But adjusted for inflation and population growth, general revenue spending is estimated to be down about 11.5 percent, according to the report. That&rsquo;s pretty close to the 10.7 percent that Dewhurst cited at the debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpen and shut case?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot exactly. We spotted several wrinkles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor instance, general revenue spending, adjusted for inflation and population growth, did not drop in every biennium once Dewhurst began presiding over the Senate. According to the budget board&rsquo;s report, adjusted general revenue spending, when compared to the previous biennium, rose twice and dropped three times. The biggest drop came in 2004-05, when adjusted general revenue spending declined 9.6 percent. The highest increase came in 2008-09, when the level rose 10.8 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore significantly, the estimated spending levels for 2012-13 in Dewhurst&rsquo;s backup material and the budget board&rsquo;s report fail to account for more than $6 billion in spending that the 2011 Legislature, in a maneuver to help balance the budget, pushed into the next biennium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/jun/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-lawmakers-balanced-budget-an/\">much-reported</a> during the 2011 legislative session that lawmakers failed to appropriate enough state money to cover projected Medicaid costs for 2012-13. The budget board&rsquo;s report says it is expected that the 2013 Legislature will have to put more money &mdash; estimated at about $4 billion &mdash; into the program to help pay for &quot;the last four to five months of fiscal year 2013.&quot; The report says the amount of money needed could vary based on factors such as the size of the state&rsquo;s caseload and medical costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not all. Also as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/jul/04/charles-perry/charles-perry-says-6-billion-projected-accumulate-/\">widely reported</a>, lawmakers reduced spending on public education in the 2012-13 budget in part by delaying a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts by several days, pushing it from the end of the 2013 fiscal year into the next budget cycle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered how these maneuvers might be inflating the general-revenue reduction proclaimed by Dewhurst &mdash; and made a run at rolling the postponed education payment and Medicaid costs into the estimated 2012-13 general revenue spending figures in the board report. We then adjusted for inflation and population growth using the same factors as the board staff and compared our new 2012-13 figure with the 2002-03 spending level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur finding: Estimated general revenue spending in 2012-13 still appears to be less than such spending in 2002-03. However, the difference is 4.7 percent &mdash; not the 10.7 percent Dewhurst cited at the debate or the 11.5 percent aired by his campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst&rsquo;s debate claim that state general revenue spending dropped by 10.7 percent on his watch is close to the 11.5 percent reduction that a comparison of 2012-13 estimated spending to 2002-03 spending yields.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that result is misleading, too simplistic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, it overlooks changes &mdash; up and down &mdash; in general revenue spending, adjusted for inflation and population growth, between each of the preceding two-year budgets. Second, the spending figure for 2012-13 does not account for more than $6 billion in state costs postponed to the next budget period. Rolling in those costs, making for a closer-to-realistic accounting of costs in the latest Dewhurst-touched budget, shrinks the difference of 11.5 percent to 4.7 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Dewhurst&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-19T12:27:33.948767", "ruling_date": "2012-04-20T13:27:01", "ruling_headline": "David Dewhurst says state general revenue spending has dropped about 11% on his watch", "ruling_headline_slug": "david-dewhurst-says-state-general-revenue-spending", "ruling_link_text": "Not so simple", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWFAA-TV, <a href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/home/related/Replay-The-Belo-Debate-Part-I-147395965.html\">debate</a>, Republican U.S. Senate candidates, April 13, 2012 (go to 12:20 mark)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap3RSQaAZ707dHo5QjJacWlPaUtpbUhMai15S3A2YWc\">Spreadsheet</a> from David Dewhurst campaign, &quot;Trends in state government expenditures&quot; (received April 16, 2012)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislative Budget Board, <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Fiscal_Size-up/Fiscal%20Size-up%202012-13.pdf\">report</a>, Fiscal Size-up, 2012-13 biennium, January 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Texas, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/nov/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-leaders-cut-15-billion-state/\">Truth-O-Meter item</a>, &quot;Rick Perry says Texas leaders cut $15 billion from state budget,&quot; Nov. 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDallas Morning News, <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/11/dewhurst-budgets-shrunk-11-per.html\">blog post</a>, &quot;When Dewhurst says he&rsquo;s shrunk budget by 11 percent, he uses 2 tricks,&quot; Nov. 17, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Lieutenant governor", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 315, "last_name": "Dewhurst", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "david-dewhurst", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Dewhurstmug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/315/", "total_count": 41, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.daviddewhurst.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays that when adjusted for inflation and population growth, state general revenue spending has decreased 10.7 percent on his watch.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Republican U.S. Senate debate", "statement_date": "2012-04-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
