When <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/27/donald-trump/did-us-spend-6-trillion-middle-east-wars/\">running for president in 2016</a>, Trump said America had spent $6 trillion on its response to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. In Michigan, he added another trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have spent $7 trillion &mdash; trillion with a T &mdash; $7 trillion in the Middle East,&quot; he told the crowd <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?444641-1/president-trump-remarks-michigan-rally\">April 28, 2018</a>. &quot;You know what we have for it? Nothing. Nothing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Trump inaccurately treated money that university researchers have predicted will be spent decades in the future as if it were already spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House pointed to a couple of studies to back up Trump&rsquo;s number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2016/Costs%20of%20War%20through%202016%20FINAL%20final%20v2.pdf\">2016 analysis</a> from a Boston University political scientist Neta Crawford calculated that by August 2016, the United States had &quot;already appropriated, spent, or taken on obligations to spend more than $3.6 trillion in current dollars on the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria and on Homeland Security.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after adding an estimated $1 trillion for the future cost of treating wounded veterans through 2053, plus money for the Defense Department to fight wars, the total reached nearly $4.8 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crawford&rsquo;s paper included this table:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4ZAlZAZ1EAuiAgG0ZWDlViT71gipg_Es7ebUNLtBDSLV2SOwUmOGDmSdDZ6XV4xWZwB_i5ZjalWSmOroGyq3Z-uimFrs98ImPYYMWhPlpVtL_tGD-zSXwRGdcivugjwE9zxl7_tO\" style=\"border:none; height:424px; width:578px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last row of her table, Crawford adds about $3 trillion in cumulative interest to reach a figure of nearly $8 trillion &mdash; over 35 years. She told us she used unpublished projections from the economist who wrote a <a href=\"http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2011/Post-9%3A11%20War%20Spending%2C%20Debt%2C%20and%20the%20Macroeconomy.pdf\">2011 paper</a> on the macroeconomic impacts of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimated future cost of veteran care and debt service also played a role in a <a href=\"https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=8956&amp;type=WPN\">2013 Harvard Kennedy School</a> working paper that estimated long-term costs of $4 trillion to $6 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The largest portion of that bill is yet to be paid,&quot; the authors wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key costs in the years ahead were veterans care, replacing military hardware, and interest on the debt that financed the fighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53797\">Congressional Budget Office</a>, recent tax and spending bills make rising debt more likely in the years ahead, adding weight to the projected finance costs associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors of both papers acknowledge that there are large uncertainties in predicting costs so many years in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at direct spending, the Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf\">estimated</a> in 2014 that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars had cost the United States about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. That figure did not include ongoing care for veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that America has spent $7 trillion on the Middle East. The key flaw is Trump treated long-range estimates as money already spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The money actually spent so far is closer to $2 trillion. The reports cited by the White House estimated costs about 30 years into the future. The highest estimate in those reports supports Trump&rsquo;s $7 trillion figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, wounded veterans will need care and debt must be repaid with interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-30T16:53:45.013172", "ruling_date": "2018-05-01T10:19:50", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says US spent $7 trillion on Middle East wars.
