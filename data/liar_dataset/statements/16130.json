Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tony Evers have sparred over a wide-range of issues in the run-up to the Nov. 6 election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the most notable: Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/columnists/christian-schneider/2018/06/22/scott-walker-wisconsins-education-governor/721770002/\">June 2018</a>, Walker proclaimed himself the &quot;education governor&quot; -- a not-so-subtle dig at Evers, who is state schools superintendent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We need to make sure that every student graduates here in the state of Wisconsin. That every student, no matter where they come from, what ZIP code they live in, graduates,&quot; Walker told reporters <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/04/wisconsin-governors-race-scott-walker-tony-evers-talk-education/1191065002/\">Sept. 4, 2018</a>, at an event welcoming students back to classes at a school in Waukesha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers responded with a Sept. 25, 2018, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAsU-MeP8w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">TV ad</a> that began with ominous music and the question: &quot;Do you trust Scott Walker on education?&quot; The ad went on to tout several claims about Evers&rsquo; achievements, including this one that we want to check:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tony raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is he right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digging into the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started at the state Department of Public Instruction, which Evers has led since 2009, since it is the official keeper of such numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Department spokesman Thomas McCarthy pointed us toward <a href=\"https://wisedash.dpi.wi.gov/Dashboard/Page/Home/Topic%20Area/Graduation/HS%20Completion%20(Single%20Year)/HS%20Completers%20(Single%20Year)?filtersetid=b1b506bc-6bd8-4782-8d37-3282825861f7\">WISEdash</a> -- the Wisconsin Information System for Education Data Dashboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There we found these graduation rates for the relevant years:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2009-&rsquo;10 &ndash; 85.7 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n2010-&rsquo;11 &ndash; 87 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n2011-&rsquo;12 &ndash; 87.5 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2012-&rsquo;13 &ndash; 88 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n2013-&rsquo;14 &ndash; 88.6 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n2014-&rsquo;15 &ndash; 88.4 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n2015-&rsquo;16 &ndash; 88.2 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n2016-&rsquo;17 &ndash; 88.6 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, that indicates a steady -- if slow -- increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about for the real starting point -- the year before Evers took office?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCarthy said the numbers are not comparable, because with the 2009-&rsquo;10 year, the state moved toward what is known as the &quot;adjusted cohort graduation rate.&quot; It was created by the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/what-is-the-difference-between-the-acgr-and-the-afgr\">National Center for Education Statistics</a> in an effort to address students who enter and leave a &quot;class&quot; before graduation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, the graduation rate was calculated by using a freshman class as the baseline, compared to the number of graduates four years later. The rest of the country moved to this approach a year later than Wisconsin, in 2010-&rsquo;11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, the number did rise to nearly 90 percent -- but that is only part of the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The larger point made by Evers is that he and his policies are responsible -- even solely responsible -- for the gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have seen this sort of claim many times before, when politicians take credit -- or assign blame -- for things that beyond one person&rsquo;s control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, there was this Walker claim from earlier in the campaign: &quot;Our bold reforms have Wisconsin&rsquo;s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s numbers were largely on target, but experts said there were many other factors at work. We rated it <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/18/scott-walker/record-low-unemployment-and-record-high-number-peo/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about the graduation rates?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan J. Borsuk, senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette Law School, said Evers can take some credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, it is the product of many factors, many people, and, ultimately, many students, parents and teachers doing well in their roles,&quot; said Borsuk, a former longtime education reporter at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. &quot;It&#39;s something to applaud. But it&#39;s a feather in the cap of whoever is at the top of the pyramid. And if the rates had gone down, critics and opponents would blame Evers.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Borsuk noted that at times Walker has taken credit for improvements in student performance, and cautioned: &quot;In my book, both Evers and Walker are taking credit for things that have factual basis, but the role played by them individually or by actions they led is easy to overstate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, McCarthy -- the department spokesman -- said Evers has focused on improving graduation rates since the beginning of his tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCarthy cited the convening of a &quot;graduation summit,&quot; and Evers committing to the goal of &quot;Every child a graduate, college and career ready.&quot; But he acknowledged that a central part of that plan, state grants for districts with the highest dropout rates, were not approved by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the example undermines Evers&rsquo; claim that his actions alone increased the graduation rates. It shows support from other parts of support from other parts of state government are needed for funding and policy changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other initiatives cited by McCarthy included a &quot;continuous review&quot; of academic standards, a modernized data system that can &quot;help identify students likely to drop out&quot; and &quot;modernized assessments, including the ACT (college entrance test), that complement the data system in providing feedback to teachers and parents alike.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent campaign ad, Evers says he has &quot;raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers took office in 2009. In the 2009-&rsquo;10 year, the graduation rate was 85.7 percent. In &nbsp;2016-&rsquo;17, the most recent year available, it was 88.6 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, like other politicians before him, Evers gets off track by giving himself too much credit for changes that have many factors, including -- perhaps especially -- efforts at the local school district level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-30T16:21:40.809011", "ruling_date": "2018-10-31T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers ad inflates his grade on raising graduation rates to nearly 90%", "ruling_headline_slug": "gubernatorial-candidate-tony-evers-ad-inflates-his", "ruling_link_text": "Grade inflation on graduation claim ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAsU-MeP8w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">YouTube</a>, &quot;Every Kid,&quot; Sept. 25, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/columnists/christian-schneider/2018/06/22/scott-walker-wisconsins-education-governor/721770002/\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>, &quot;Yes, Scott Walker is an &lsquo;education governor&rsquo; for Wisconsin,&quot; June 22, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/04/wisconsin-governors-race-scott-walker-tony-evers-talk-education/1191065002/\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>, &quot;Scott Walker, Tony Evers talk education, governor&rsquo;s race on back-to-school day,&quot; Sept. 4, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/what-is-the-difference-between-the-acgr-and-the-afgr\">National Center for Education Statistics</a>, &quot;What is the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate (ACGR)?&quot; November 29, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://wisedash.dpi.wi.gov/Dashboard/Page/Home/Topic%20Area/Graduation/HS%20Completion%20(Single%20Year)/HS%20Completers%20(Single%20Year)?filtersetid=b1b506bc-6bd8-4782-8d37-3282825861f7\">WISEdash</a> Wisconsin Information System for Education Data Dashboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan J.
