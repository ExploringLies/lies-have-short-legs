It&rsquo;s maximizing returns for investors.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVale said that was the point of the chart.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The goal of Romney&rsquo;s investments was to maximize profits, not create jobs. We are not saying he never created a job. He needs people to feed his dressage horse and wash his cars,&quot; Vale said. &quot;We are saying his investments were about maximizing profit. He did that by laying off workers and sending jobs overseas.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that doesn&rsquo;t mean Romney&rsquo;s investments created &quot;0&quot; jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Private equity vs. venture capital</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, sometimes Bain profits and jobs grew together.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney has repeatedly claimed that Bain was a job creator.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In the business I had, we invested in over 100 different businesses and net-net, taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added, those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndependent journalists, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jan/09/mitt-romneys-job-creator-claim-falters-bain-capita/\">including us</a>, haven&rsquo;t been able to confirm that &quot;net-net&quot; Bain investments added 100,000 jobs. Bain won&rsquo;t release enough information to do the math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut here are some things we do know. Sometimes Bain acted as a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-two-faces-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital/2012/01/10/gIQArYmRoP_blog.html\">private equity firm</a>, buying stakes in businesses, taking out loans to retool the companies and pay themselves fees, then selling their stakes at a profit. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-20/romney-as-job-creator-clashes-with-bain-record-of-job-cuts.html\">Thousands of workers lost their jobs</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut some studies show that private equity in general results in minimal net job loss. Companies shed jobs, but <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/is-private-equity-bad-for-the-economy/251245/\">mostly make it up</a> with hiring later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen there are the times that Bain acted as a venture capitalist, investing in young companies to help them grow. (Something that generally requires hiring workers, not laying them off.) That&rsquo;s the case for companies like Staples, an example Romney loves to cite. And for good reason.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere are the most widely reported Bain job gains and losses, as rounded up by <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-05/fact-check-romney-jobs/52397232/1\">FactCheck.org</a> from<em> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0108/7967.html\">POLITICO</a></em> and the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/us/politics/retirement-deal-keeps-bain-money-flowing-to-romney.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;seid=auto&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;adxnnlx=1324287455-SQWzPMJabcqhaZMkkSQ4lQ&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;pagewanted=all\">New York Times</a></em>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Romney&#39;s campaign says three companies in which Bain invested alone have created more than 100,000 jobs: Staples (89,000), Sports Authority (15,000) and Domino&#39;s (7,900 jobs added since 1999). That&#39;s 111,900 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Two of those were venture capital investments; Domino&rsquo;s was a private equity buyout.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Companies that lost jobs include American Pad &amp; Paper (385), Dade International (1,900), DDi Corp. (2,100), Clear Channel Communications (2,500) and KB Toys (3,400). That&#39;s 10,285 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther roundups with a narrower time frame &mdash; the years before Romney retired &mdash; also show <a href=\"http://www.american.com/archive/2012/january/how-many-jobs-did-romney-create-at-bain\">tens of thousands</a> of new jobs, and fewer job losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone of these tallies is comprehensive. There&rsquo;s also a fair question whether Romney <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-05/fact-check-romney-jobs/52397232/1\">deserves credit</a> for all jobs gained &mdash; or blame for jobs lost. Some commentators say the issue isn&rsquo;t that Bain companies shed jobs, but that they shed &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/opinion/bain-barack-and-jobs.html?_r=1\">good jobs</a>.&quot; But this ad went way beyond that thoughtful criticism. It said his investments&rsquo; job creation was zero.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWorkers&rsquo; Voice says the &quot;number of jobs that Romney&rsquo;s investments created&quot; is zero. That ignores Bain&rsquo;s role as a venture capital firm that helped build companies that hired tens of thousands of workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe PAC, unable to provide data to back up its claim, said the goal of Romney&rsquo;s investments wasn&rsquo;t jobs, but profits. That doesn&rsquo;t prove Bain&rsquo;s job creation was zero. Nor do examples of Romney investments that lost jobs. This catchy claim comes up empty.
