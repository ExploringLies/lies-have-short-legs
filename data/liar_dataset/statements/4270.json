The flier cites <a href=\"http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_Company.aspx\">Uline</a>, a national distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials, and includes this headline:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Bob Wirch helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did he?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUline <a href=\"http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx\">describes </a><a href=\"http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx\">itself</a> as a family-owned company that employs 2,600 employees across the country. It was founded in 1980 by Dick and Liz Uihlein; <a href=\"http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx\">Dick </a><a href=\"http://www.uline.com/Corporate/About_History.aspx\">Uihlein</a> is the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/29416029.html\">great-grandson</a> of the founder of the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., one of Milwaukee&rsquo;s famed beer makers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe company was headquartered in Waukegan, Ill., just south of the Wisconsin border, when it <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1rkoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MUUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=uline&amp;pg=2554%2C137063\">announced</a> n June 2006 that it would expand in <a href=\"http://www.pleasantprairieonline.com/about/history.asp\">Pleasant Prairie</a>, a Kenosha suburb about 40 miles south of Milwaukee. Both Wirch and Steitz, a lawyer who is making his first run for public office, live in the village.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUline made big news in January 2008, when it <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/29416029.html\">announced</a> it would move its headquarters to Pleasant Prairie and build a distribution center there, investing $100 million and employing 1,000 people by 2010. The company also said it would utilize state government <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/96349074.html\">incentives</a> that were later calculated to be worth up to $18.6 million over nine years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wirch campaign flier led Dick and Liz Uihlein to issue a <a href=\"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/journaltimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/5f/95f07712-be09-11e0-8747-001cc4c03286/4e39a61812c72.pdf.pdf\">statement</a> in response on Aug. 3, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We worked with a variety of state and local officials during the relocation process; however, state Sen. Wirch was not one of them,&quot; the couple said in the statement, noting they do not support Wirch&rsquo;s campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a strong rebuttal to Wirch&rsquo;s claim that he aided in the company&rsquo;s move.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement also noted that a <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/sb144\">bill</a> Wirch sponsored to help Pleasant Prairie with economic development -- which is also mentioned in his campaign flier -- was not introduced until July 2011 -- months after Uline had completed its relocation. The bill was &quot;by no means a determinative factor in our decision to relocate,&quot; the company&rsquo;s statement said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Wirch&rsquo;s bill was signed into law in August 2011, Wirch said it would lead to 800 new jobs in Pleasant Prairie being created through a future expansion at Uline and the launching of a new biotechnology business incubator, according to the <em>Kenosha News</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those 800 jobs are only projected, not already created, as the headline in Wirch&rsquo;s campaign flier stated. Only some of the jobs are expected to come from Uline. And, in any case, they have nothing to do with Wirch&rsquo;s claim that he helped Uline relocate to Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked to respond to the statement issued by Uline, Wirch said in an email to the Racine <em>Journal Times</em> that he had toured Uline in 2010 &quot;and discussed with company leadership the importance of a strong workforce and well-trained workforce.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut touring Uline after it had relocated hardly equates to helping land the company in the first place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso responding to Uline&rsquo;s statement, Wirch campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the <em>Kenosha News</em> that all references to Uline would be omitted from future campaign materials. &quot;Sen. Wirch is very respectful of Uline&rsquo;s wishes and he has no intention of misrepresenting them,&quot; Walzak was quoted as saying.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Gillian Morris, another spokesperson for Wirch&rsquo;s campaign, for evidence that Wirch helped Uline&rsquo;s relocation from Illinois. She argued the statement Dick Uihlein issued was &quot;politically motivated&quot; since he had <a href=\"http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/richard-uihlein.asp?cycle=08\">contribute</a> to the anti-tax <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/club-growth/\">Club for Growth</a>. That&rsquo;s not even on point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement in question from Wirch is his claim that he &quot;helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs.&quot; We found there is no evidence to back the boast.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUline brought roughly that number of jobs to Wirch&rsquo;s state Senate district by the time it concluded its move from Illinois in 2010. But the company said it didn&rsquo;t work with Wirch at all on the relocation. And the bill Wirch makes reference to wasn&rsquo;t signed into law until long after Uline had relocated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWirch&rsquo;s claim of helping land a big new employer is not only false but ridiculous -- or, Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note: </strong>After this item was posted Aug. 12, 2011, Wirch&rsquo;s campaign provided us additional information -- pointing to a bill other than the one cited in the original flier as evidence Wirch helped bring Uline to the area. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2007/data/SB-417.pdf\">That bill</a>, sponsored by Wirch, allowed for business expansion in the area of Pleasant Prairie where Uline moved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, the bill was introduced Jan. 25, 2008 -- three weeks after Uline had already announced its relocation Uline&rsquo;s chief financial officer, Frank Unick, would not comment on whether the bill played a role in the relocation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPleasant Prairie Village Administrator Mike Pollocoff said part of the company&rsquo;s expansion could not have occurred without the bill, which also affected other companies. But by that point, Uline had already committed to the $100 million relocation. So, we feel it&rsquo;s a stretch to say the bill &quot;helped bring&quot; the company to Pleasant Prairie.</em></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-11T15:46:09.788225", "ruling_date": "2011-08-12T09:57:19", "ruling_headline": "In Wisconsin recall race, Dem state Sen.
