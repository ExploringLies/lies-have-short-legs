John Oliver, a correspondent for Comedy Central&rsquo;s The Daily Show, says so, but we noticed a more testable observation he made after his January &quot;pilgrimage to Tejas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years ago, Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, &quot;became the first Jewish speaker of the&quot; Texas House, Oliver said during a segment on the House speaker&rsquo;s race that aired Feb. 3. &quot;But that meant trouble when he came up for re-election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January, Straus withstood Republican challengers backed by GOP activists who said Straus wasn&rsquo;t conservative enough to repeat as speaker, especially after Republicans dominated November&rsquo;s elections, upping their House majority to 101 of its 150 seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oliver&rsquo;s report falls short of demonstrating that Straus&rsquo;s religion put a drag on his political fortunes. Yet the spoof features people praying for a &quot;godly, humble leader of the Texas House.&quot; And it closes with schoolchildren marking a new &quot;high holiday&quot; in Straus&rsquo;s honor with a celebratory song that opens with a reference to anti-Semites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out-of-state humor aside, we wondered if Straus is indeed the first Jewish Texas House speaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Austin American-Statesman news article from January 2009, just before House members elevated Straus to the speaker&rsquo;s post, said he appeared poised to become &quot;the first Jewish speaker of the Texas House since statehood.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Texas was a state, the article says, David Kaufman served as speaker of the House in the Congress of the Republic of Texas from 1839 to 1841. Kaufman was of Jewish descent, &quot;but historians have found no evidence he was a practicing Jew and he did not receive a Jewish burial, said Hollace Ava Weiner, editor of &lsquo;Lone Stars of David: The Jews of Texas.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rabbi Jimmy Kessler of Temple B&rsquo;nai Israel in Galveston told us that &quot;usually a person of the Jewish faith will buried in a Jewish cemetery.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also pointed to the 1990 book, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Heart-Legends-Photographic-History/dp/0890157596\">Deep in the Heart: Lives and Legends of Texas Jews: A Photographic History</a>,&quot; which says that Kaufman &quot;was of Hebrew descent but not a practicing Jew.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Bryan Stone, an associate history professor at Del Mar College in Corpus Christi and author of the book, &quot;The Chosen Folks,&quot; about Jewish Texans, told us: &quot;There have been many Jewish members of the Texas Legislature going back to early statehood, but Straus is definitely the first Jewish speaker.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Oliver&rsquo;s statement as Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CORRECTION</strong>, 12:30 p.m., Feb. 12, 2011: The story below has been amended to remove a description of a 19th century speaker of the Texas House as the sole Jewish member of the Texas Legislature until the 1970s. That&rsquo;s incorrect. After he served as House speaker, however, <a href=\"http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fka12\">David Kaufman </a>was the only Jewish Texan to serve in the U.S. Congress until the 1970s, according to the Handbook of Texas Online.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-10T16:13:27.607965", "ruling_date": "2011-02-12T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "John Oliver of Daily Show says Rep.
