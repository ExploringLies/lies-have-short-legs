Ted Cruz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gromer Jeffers of the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> said to O&rsquo;Rourke: &quot;You have addressed your 1998 DWI arrest numerous times during your public career. But not this question: As the Houston Chronicle pointed out recently, a witness said in that accident that you tried to leave the scene of the accident. Did you and should voters be concerned about this incident?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke replied at the Southern Methodist University debate: &quot;I did not try to leave the scene of the accident--though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense and I will not try to provide one. I can only tell you that I was able to have a second chance in my life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke went on to tick-tock his subsequent opening of a business with friends in his hometown of El Paso where, he said, he met his wife with whom he&rsquo;s raising three children. Also, O&rsquo;Rourke said, he won election to the El Paso City Council and, in 2012, to the U.S. House, which he&rsquo;s leaving after this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I made the most that I could with my second choice and my opportunity,&quot; O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Readers asked us if O&rsquo;Rourke tried to leave the scene of his accident and arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Houston Chronicle </em>news story cites police report</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Chronicle</em>, in an Aug. 30, 2018, <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Police-reports-detail-Beto-O-Rourke-s-1998-13195088.php\">news story</a>, said a police report shows that the incident was a more serious threat to public safety than previously reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newspaper, citing the report, said that O&rsquo;Rourke was driving drunk at what a witness called &quot;a high rate of speed&quot; in a 75 mph zone on Interstate 10 about a mile east of the New Mexico border. He lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median. The story said that the witness, described as stopping at the scene, later told police that O&rsquo;Rourke had tried to leave the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report, the story says, refers to&nbsp;an unnamed&nbsp;&quot;motorist&rsquo;s description of O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s dark-colored Volvo passing him quickly about 3 a.m. on I-10.&quot; The story says that O&#39;Rourke reportedly struck a truck going in the same direction and crossed a grassy median into the opposite lanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story says that according to the police report, &quot;O&rsquo;Rourke then attempted to leave the scene but was stopped by the same motorist he had just passed. The unidentified motorist &lsquo;then turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get the defendant (O&rsquo;Rourke) to stop,&rsquo; the report says.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story says that O&#39;Rourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. He was arrested at the scene, the story said, and charged with DWI, but completed a court-approved diversion program and had the charges dismissed, post-arrest developments we confirmed for a <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2018/aug/22/silvestre-reyes/beto-orourke-arrested-1990s-burglary-and-dwi/\">previous fact-check</a> confirming the September 1998 arrest and a previous one, when O&rsquo;Rourke was a college student, for getting past a fence to enter the University of Texas at El Paso campus in the wee hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Police agency confirms report&#39;s authenticity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, we asked the Anthony Police Department to review the <a href=\"https://m.chron.com/file/344/3/3443-beto%20DUI%20arrest.PDF\">12-page partially-redacted police report</a> posted next to the <em>Chronicle </em>story. In response, a department officer, Linda Hartt-Goggin, said the posted report &quot;appears to be a true redacted copy of the original report.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hartt-Goggin said by phone she couldn&rsquo;t find the department&rsquo;s report on the accident itself. She speculated that it was lost when a room was flooded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to APD Investigator Richard Carrera&rsquo;s report, filed three days after the accident, O&rsquo;Rourke said after his 3 a.m. arrest that he&rsquo;d been driving to Los Alamos in New Mexico. The officer&rsquo;s report says that he met at the scene with a witness--called the &quot;reporter&quot; in Carrera&rsquo;s report--and his partner, the driver of &quot;the American Medical ambulance.&quot; By phone, Hartt-Goggin told us the ambulance company serves private clients out of Las Cruces, NM. Our attempts to reach a Las Cruces official with American Medical Response, a <a href=\"https://www.amr.net/home/national\">Colorado-based company</a>, didn&rsquo;t draw an immediate response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carrera&rsquo;s report says the witness said that he initially saw a green Volvo pass his vehicle at a high rate of speed westbound on I-10. &quot;The vehicle then lost control moments later and struck a truck traveling the same direction,&quot; the report says. &quot;After the driver/defendant struck the truck, it sent the defendant&rsquo;s vehicle across the center median and to a complete stop facing east bound,&quot; the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The defendant/driver then attempted to leave the scene,&quot; the report says. But the witness &quot;turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to get the defendant to stop.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report says that when the officer engaged O&rsquo;Rourke in conversation, he wasn&rsquo;t understandable due to slurred speech. The report says the officer asked O&rsquo;Rourke to step out of the vehicle and &quot;upon doing so the defendant almost fell to the floor,&quot; the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> asked the Texas Department of Public Safety for&nbsp;agency reports on file about the incident. M.L. Calcote said in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Nkt3e7ncnmWlVBYm16R3RHc1BEc2VfcEw5SzM3Z1JZQUNF/view?usp=sharing\">a September 2018 letter</a> sent by email that the agency didn&rsquo;t have responsive records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>O&#39;Rourke stands by debate statement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s campaign about the witness telling Carrera that&nbsp;O&rsquo;Rourke tried to leave the accident scene. By email, Chris Evans said O&rsquo;Rourke stands by what he said at the debate about not trying to leave. Evans noted that the &quot;police report shows he was arrested for a DWI, not for leaving or attempting to leave the scene.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke said he didn&rsquo;t try to leave the scene of his 1998 DWI accident and arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Records indicate O&rsquo;Rourke was arrested at the scene and wasn&rsquo;t charged with trying to flee. But the September 1998 Anthony Police Department report on the incident says a witness said O&rsquo;Rourke tried to leave the scene before police arrived and the witness kept him from doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
