And in typical drive-by-media fashion, he said, reporters rushed to spread lies when the news broke and were just as quick to exit when the facts emerged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;MSNBC went to paid programming while they had editorial conferences to figure out how to deal with this!&quot; Limbaugh said, and emphasized the point later in his program. &quot;MSNBC, like I said, practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered did MSNBC interrupt&nbsp;their programming for an extended commercial break after the details of Brown&rsquo;s theft were released?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pressing matters </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that the timeline of the revelations is fragmented. Information was released incrementally during three press conferences on Aug. 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first press conference, which lasted from 9:43 to 9:47 a.m. Eastern Time, Ferguson police chief Jackson <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/3731825077001/ferguson-police-reveal-name-of-officer-involved-in-shooting/#sp=show-clips\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>revealed</u></a> Wilson&rsquo;s name, gave a timeline of the events surrounding the shooting<strong> </strong>and robbery and announced he would take no questions. Members of the media received documents on the case and still images from surveillance footage of the robbery in press packets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The police report said that &quot;<a href=\"http://documents.latimes.com/police-report-michael-brown-case/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Brown is the primary suspect in the robbery</u></a>,&quot; and Jackson&rsquo;s comments seemed to suggest that the encounter between Brown and Wilson was related to the robbery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that afternoon, the entire video of the robbery was released, around the time of a separate press conference <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?321034-1/news-conference-ferguson-missouri-shooting\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>held</u></a> by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Johnson expressed his frustration at the Ferguson police&rsquo;s handling of the case. That press conference lasted from 12:09 p.m &nbsp;to 12:45 p.m. Eastern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the surveillance video Jackson alluded to in his morning briefing, the exact timing of the full footage release is unclear, with dissonance between the three major cable networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> was one of the first -- if not, <em>the </em>first -- news outlet to <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/multimedia/videos/ferguson-police-release-convenience-store-surveillance-video/html_9cdfc317-764d-5ccd-a574-2c75d2d0c753.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>air</u></a> the video at noon Eastern. MSNBC led with the footage minutes later on <em>Andrea Mitchell, </em>after the show began at noon. Fox News aired it 40 minutes later. On CNN&rsquo;s <em>Wolf, </em>reporter Don Lemon said at 1:13 p.m. that the network still didn&rsquo;t have the tape in its hands. By 1:25 p.m., host Wolf Blitzer said CNN had the tape but is &quot;vetting it before we put it on air.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a later press conference from 3:05 p.m. to 3:14 p.m., Jackson <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ferguson-police-chief-officer-wilson-didnt-know-michael-brown-was-a-suspect/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>clarified</u></a> that Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery case when he stopped the 18-year-old. Jackson also said that the matter is under investigation and that he released the documents because of Freedom of Information requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Timeline of coverage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a software called Critical Mention, we found when the three major cable&nbsp;news networks released the materials related to Brown&rsquo;s death and robbery and when they went to commercial break on Aug.15.
