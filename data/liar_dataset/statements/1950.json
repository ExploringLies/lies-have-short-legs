Hank Johnson has not done  enough to help MARTA since the congressman went to Washington in 2007.<br /><br />Here's  one verbal volley by Jones from a June 3 candidate forum in southeast  Atlanta: \"Four years as a congressman, he [Johnson] never talked about  MARTA.\"<br /><br />Never? Isn't that a little bit extreme?<br /><br />\"You can't  find anything where Hank has talked about MARTA,\" Jones said in a  telephone interview last week.<br /><br />Well, PolitiFact Georgia decided  to do a little exploring. <br /><br />A spokesman for Johnson, who  represents Georgia's 4th Congressional District, sent PolitiFact Georgia  a letter dated July 10, 2009, from the congressman to U.S. Rep. John  Olver. Olver is a Democrat from Massachusetts who is chair of the House  Appropriations subcommittee on transportation and other issues. Johnson  asked for $9 million to help MARTA buy clean-fuel buses. Johnson also  requested money for MARTA's I-20 East Transit Corridor and Clifton  Corridor studies.<br /><br />\"How much did [Johnson] get?\" asked Jones.<br /><br />Johnson  testified before Olver's committee on April 15, making another pitch  for the I-20 rail study. He also asked the committee for $12 million to  help MARTA buy new buses, to repair others and for security cameras.<br /><br />\"They're  pretty inaccurate and unfair,\" Johnson's spokesman, Andy Phelan, said  of Jones' claims.<br /><br />Jones and Johnson, most DeKalb politicos know,  worked together on the County Commission. Jones was DeKalb's chief  executive officer from 2001 to 2008. Johnson was a county commissioner  from 2001 to 2006, representing much of southeast DeKalb.<br /><br />Since  2009, Johnson has been a co-sponsor of four separate pieces of federal  legislation that obtained $5.725 million for MARTA, agency records show.  The bulk of that money, $4 million, was for the acquisition of  clean-fuel buses.<br /><br />Jones argued that Johnson has been a bit player  in these efforts to get money for MARTA.<br /><br />\"Hank is the least  senior member [of the lawmakers who co-sponsored the legislation],\"  Jones said. \"You cannot say he brought that money back [to Georgia].\"<br /><br />Jones  contends that Johnson did not get serious about his interest in MARTA  until Jones began talking about the transit system on the campaign  trail. Johnson was appointed earlier this year to the House  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Shortly afterward, Johnson  and his wife took a first-class trip on MARTA with the agency's CEO as  his guide through the district.<br /><br />The fact remains that Johnson has  talked about MARTA. The support of veteran congressmen such as Sens.  Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson and Rep. John Lewis likely played a  greater factor in getting the $5.7 million, but Johnson was a  co-sponsor.<br /><br />If Jones had simply stated that he does not believe  Johnson has done enough for MARTA, he might had dodged the  Truth-O-Meter. But with his \"never\" declaration, the former CEO wandered  right into the path of the dreaded device. <br /><br />Things are heating  up in DeKalb County politics, it seems. We give Jones a Pants on Fire  for this one.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-24T18:01:58.996728", "ruling_date": "2010-06-27T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Congressman quiet on MARTA, Jones says", "ruling_headline_slug": "congressman-quiet-marta-jones-says", "ruling_link_text": "Jones attack against Johnson on transit system off track", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Example of ideal earmark?\" June 6,  2010<br /><br />Congressional <a href=\"http://appropriations.house.gov/images/stories/pdf/tranurb/Hank_Johnson.4.15.10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">testimony</a> by U.S. Rep.
