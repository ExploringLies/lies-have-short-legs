Eight people were killed and another 12 were injured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saipov is believed to have been influenced by the terrorist group known as ISIS, or the Islamic State. Eyewitnesses said they saw Saipov shouting &quot;Allahu Akbar,&quot; a common Muslim phrase that affirms faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannity and Gorka, along with former Milwaukee County, Wis., sheriff David Clarke, were discussing Tapper&rsquo;s coverage the day of the attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m still trying to struggle with what kind of mind goes on live television as seven bodies are on the streets of Manhattan, and a child, and talks about the &lsquo;beautiful phrase&rsquo; Allahu Akbar,&quot; Gorka said. &quot;Where does that motivation come from for Jake Tapper?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not what Tapper said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During <a href=\"https://www.iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=bebfd3b0-fad6-4d60-9d51-a0056603274b&amp;ps=2\"><em>The Lead</em> on Oct. 31</a>, CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz told Tapper about witnesses hearing Saipov shout the phrase. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Arabic chant Allahu Akbar, &lsquo;God is great,&rsquo; sometimes said under the most beautiful of circumstances, and too often we hear it being said in moments like this,&quot; Tapper said as an explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapper clearly is saying that &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; is often said during joyous occasions, not implying that a terrorist&rsquo;s use of the phrase is somehow a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News&rsquo; Jason Chaffetz pointed out Tapper said &quot;how beautiful the phrase &lsquo;Allahu Akbar&rsquo; can be,&quot; but <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/11/01/jake-tapper-cnn-defends-allahu-akbar-beautiful-after-new-york-city-terror-attack\">later walked back his comments</a>. Conservative website DailyCaller.com also criticized Tapper, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/daily-caller-corrects-misleading-allahu-akbar-jake-tapper-story-then-calls-for-tapper-apology/\">then updated their story</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CNN anchor refuted Fox News&rsquo; coverage of his coverage on Twitter on Nov 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fox News is lying. I said it can be said at beautiful moments (wedding, birth) and too often at times like this (horrific terrorist attack),&quot; he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/925872783174918145\">wrote in a thread about a tweet to the Chaffetz clip</a> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jake-tapper-fox-news-lying-allahu-akbar-beautiful-2017-11\">that Fox News later deleted</a>. &quot;&lsquo;Allahu Akbar&rsquo; is a prayer; if we don&rsquo;t understand how radical Islamic terrorists justify their evil using religion, West cannot defeat it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapper <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/925909466356338690\">responded to Gorka by tweeting</a>, &quot;And, no surprise, @SebGorka lies as well, claiming i said Allahu Akbar was a &quot;beautiful phrase.&quot; Never said it, Sebastian. Blatant lie.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapper had no further comment to add when we reached out to him. Gorka did not respond to our attempts to contact him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations pointed us to a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/opinions/allahu-akbar-meaning/index.html\">Nov. 1 opinion piece on CNN.com explaining the phrase</a>. Imam Omar Suleiman, the founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, wrote that &quot;the words &lsquo;Allahu Akbar&rsquo; simply mean &lsquo;God is greater.&rsquo; It is a powerful declaration used by Muslims on many occasions and in many prayers. It is a celebration of life, the first words fathers whisper in the ears of their newborns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They are used to indicate gratitude when God bestows something upon you that you would have been incapable of attaining were it not for divine benevolence. It is a prayerful phrase that reminds us that, no matter what our concerns may be, God is greater than them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suleiman also pointed out that U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/09/04/john-mccain-explains-why-allahu-akbar-shouldnt-freak-you-out/?utm_term=.78404861b083\">had said on Fox News in 2013</a> that while &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; has been appropriated by radical Islamists as a battlecry, the words themselves aren&rsquo;t to be feared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;McCain said the phrase is no more troubling than a Christian saying &lsquo;Thank God,&rsquo; &quot; Suleiman noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gorka claimed Tapper said Allahu Akbar was a &quot;beautiful phrase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Tapper actually said was that the phrase is used &quot;under the most beautiful of circumstances&quot; by Muslims, and not just by radicals committing terrorist acts. Gorka misquoted Tapper and ignored the larger context of his comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-02T17:14:02.719205", "ruling_date": "2017-11-02T17:42:34", "ruling_headline": "Seb Gorka misquotes Jake Tapper's comment about 'Allahu Akbar'", "ruling_headline_slug": "seb-gorka-misquotes-jake-tappers-comment-about-all", "ruling_link_text": "Former Trump adviser implies callousness", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sebastian Gorka, <a href=\"https://www.iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=83bdc8fb-aa34-474f-9165-799bb4dd89a6&amp;ps=2\">comments made on Hannity</a>, Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/09/04/john-mccain-explains-why-allahu-akbar-shouldnt-freak-you-out/?utm_term=.72dc24a74c26\">John McCain explains why &lsquo;Allahu Akbar&rsquo; shouldn&rsquo;t freak you out</a>,&quot; Sept. 4, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jake Tapper, <a href=\"https://www.iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=bebfd3b0-fad6-4d60-9d51-a0056603274b&amp;ps=2\">comments made on The Lead</a>, Oct. 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, &quot;<a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/11/01/jake-tapper-cnn-defends-allahu-akbar-beautiful-after-new-york-city-terror-attack\">CNN&#39;s Jake Tapper: &#39;Allahu Akbar&#39; Can Be Said Under &#39;Most Beautiful&#39; of Circumstances</a>,&quot; Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/925872783174918145\">Jake Tapper tweets</a>, Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/925909466356338690\">Jake Tapper tweet</a>, Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/opinions/allahu-akbar-meaning/index.html\">What &#39;Allahu Akbar&#39; really means</a>,&quot; Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BusinessInsider.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jake-tapper-fox-news-lying-allahu-akbar-beautiful-2017-11\">Jake Tapper slams Fox News for misrepresenting comments about New York terror attack</a>,&quot; Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediaite.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/daily-caller-corrects-misleading-allahu-akbar-jake-tapper-story-then-calls-for-tapper-apology/\">Daily Caller Corrects Misleading &lsquo;Allahu Akbar&rsquo; Jake Tapper Story, Then Calls For Tapper Apology?!</a>,&quot; Nov. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/us/new-york-attack/index.html\">New York attack suspect charged with federal terrorism offenses</a>,&quot; Nov. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jake Tapper, CNN anchor, Nov. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Ibrahim Hooper, Council on American-Islamic Relations spokesman, Nov. 2, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Deputy assistant to the president", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Sebastian", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 3997, "last_name": "Gorka", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "sebastian-gorka", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gorkamug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3997/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://whitehouse.gov"}, "statement": "<p>Says Jake Tapper said Allahu Akbar was a &quot;beautiful phrase&quot; after a terrorist attack in New York.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an appearance on 'Hannity'", "statement_date": "2017-11-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 9, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/9/", "subject": "Religion", "subject_slug": "religion", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Seb Gorka misquotes Jake Tapper's comment about 'Allahu Akbar'"}
