Rick Perry, just sworn in to a fresh four-year term, is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M University, where he was a student yell leader. Not so well known: the claim Perry put forth in his inaugural address Tuesday on the south side of the Texas Capitol: &quot;For 154 years, they kept an Aggie out of the Governor&rsquo;s Office.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t read Perry&rsquo;s remark as a claim that Aggies never even entered a governor&rsquo;s office -- say, to visit. Still, we were hooked: Is Perry truly the first Aggie governor of Texas since statehood in 1845?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNews reports from the start of his first term say so.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA Dec. 21, 2000, news article in the Austin American-Statesman said that after Gov. George W. Bush resigned that morning, then-Lt. Gov. Perry would be sworn in as his successor that afternoon. The story refers to Perry as &quot;the first Texas A&amp;M graduate to get the job.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLikewise, a May 4, 2001 Associated Press dispatch on Perry&rsquo;s first gubernatorial visit to A&amp;M&rsquo;s College Station campus opens: &quot;Aggie Rick Perry, the first Texas A&amp;M graduate to be Texas governor...&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe AP story said other Aggies had run for governor, including 1990 Republican nominee Clayton Williams, but &quot;no Aggies have been elected.&quot; Perry, a West Texan who graduated in 1972 with a degree in animal science, is quoted saying: &quot;Had it not been for my opportunity to get an education at Texas A&amp;M,&quot; becoming governor &quot;wouldn&#39;t have been possible.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe checked the news reports by consulting an online database of gubernatorial biographies kept by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Perry&rsquo;s biography, he is &quot;the first Texas A&amp;M graduate to occupy the Texas Governor&rsquo;s Mansion.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo previous guvs established A&amp;M ties after serving in the state&rsquo;s top elected office. Richard Hubbard, governor from 1876-1879, attended Mercer University in Georgia and then Harvard University, but later joined A&amp;M&rsquo;s board of directors, which later became the board of regents. And in 1891, Lawrence Sullivan Ross followed up two terms as governor by stepping &quot;immediately into the presidency of the seriously troubled Agricultural Mechanical College of Texas,&quot; which later was renamed Texas A&amp;M University.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSix governors have attended the University of Texas, most recently Dolph Briscoe, who graduated from from UT in 1942 before serving as governor from 1973-1979. Other governors were connected to UT in some other fashion, like Ann Richards, who graduated from Baylor University before earning her teaching certificate at UT in Austin.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNever mind those teasips, as the Aggies call UT students. Hullabaloo, Caneck, Caneck! Perry&rsquo;s statement is True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-18T17:05:15.265848", "ruling_date": "2011-01-19T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rick Perry says Aggies were kept out of governor's office until he made it in 2000", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-perry-says-aggies-were-kept-out-governors-off", "ruling_link_text": "Cue the band", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Associated Press, news article, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/11611_apstory.doc\">&quot;Aggie Rick Perry makes first Aggieland appearance as Texas governor,&quot;</a> May 4, 2001 (Nexis search)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAustin American-Statesman, news article, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/12212000_aasnewsarticleperry.doc\">&quot;Texas will have new governor today,&quot;</a> Dec. 21, 2000 (Nexis search)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Lane Stephenson, director of news and information services, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, Jan. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGov.
