We are sure the claim wasn&#39;t intended as a joke, because it&#39;s included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting &quot;Obamacare&quot; patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We feel comfortable, both from talking to experts and from our years of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/subjects/health-care/\">reporting</a> on the law, that there is no such provision. If there were, it would probably be ripe for challenge on constitutional grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as &quot;outrageous,&quot; &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;ludicrous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course there&#39;s nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient,&quot; said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, no dice on the literal reading of her claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed. Is the idea that American-trained doctors will be pickier about accepting insurance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some evidence that medical practices are wary about taking patients from plans sold on the marketplace. In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- <a href=\"http://www.mgma.com/WorkArea/mgma_downloadasset.aspx?id=1375747\"><u>surveyed 1,000 physician groups</u></a> that collectively employ 47,500 doctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey asked, among other things, &quot;Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?&quot; Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive &quot;yes.&quot; That rate is twice as high as the share that that said &quot;no&quot; (14 percent) but less than those that were still weighing their options (40 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top reasons? A fear of bureaucratic regulations, low reimbursement rates and the need to collect payment from patients with higher deductibles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that this study is not evidence that can be used to support Coulter&rsquo;s specific claim, because it says nothing about foreign-trained doctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the closer you look at the issue of foreign-trained doctors, the less plausible Coulter&rsquo;s claim becomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/img/img-workforce-paper.pdf\"><u>2010 study by the American Medical Association</u></a>, about 26 percent of physicians in the United States were trained in other countries. This number includes both foreign-born doctors who trained overseas and Americans who received their medical education in other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But tough licensing requirements for foreign-trained doctors -- requirements that won&rsquo;t be changed by Obama&rsquo;s law -- are keeping the number of foreign-trained physicians low. A key barrier is the need to obtain a residency in the United States, even if an applicant had practiced or had a residency overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html?pagewanted=all\"><u>New York Times</u></a></em>, just 42 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the leading matching service succeeded, compared to 94 percent of those who had trained in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With such high barriers to entry, it&rsquo;s not credible that a flood of foreign-trained doctors will suddenly swoop in and, without the help of a single American-trained doctor, serve each one of the newly insured patients who bought policies on the new marketplaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t seen any study that would suggest that American-trained doctors would be disproportionately less likely to see the newly insured,&quot; Baicker said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even if there were such evidence, &quot;disproportionate is a far cry from &lsquo;none,&rsquo; &quot; said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. &quot;There is no limit to the nonsense that some are saying. This borders on the absurd.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coulter said that &quot;no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.&quot; Nothing in the law bars American-trained physicians from treating newly insured people under Obamacare. It&rsquo;s a ridiculous claim -- one with a whiff of xenophobia -- that merits a Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-16T17:24:23.538469", "ruling_date": "2013-10-16T17:44:30", "ruling_headline": "Ann Coulter says no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare", "ruling_headline_slug": "ann-coulter-says-no-doctors-who-went-american-medi", "ruling_link_text": "Our experts say: \"outrageous,\" \"ridiculous,\" \"ludicrous\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ann Coulter, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2013-10-09.html\"><u>Democrats to America: We Own the Government!</u></a>&quot; Oct 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical Group Management Association, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mgma.com/WorkArea/mgma_downloadasset.aspx?id=1375747\"><u>ACA Insurance Exchange Implementation, Sept. 2013</u></a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Medical Association, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/img/img-workforce-paper.pdf\"><u>International Medical Graduates in American Medicine: Contemporary challenges and opportunities</u></a>,&quot; January 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html?pagewanted=all\"><u>Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W.
