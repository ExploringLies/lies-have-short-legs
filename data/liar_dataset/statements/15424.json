They need the ability to be able to deal with their addiction and the health care they need to heal from their mental health issues.

That includes transportation from the prison. If an inmate doesn&rsquo;t have transportation from family or friends, the department will provide a ride or a bus ticket, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that inmates generally are returned to the county where the crime was committed -- which may or may not be where they lived or now have family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dameon Payton told us the state gave him a bus ticket back to Milwaukee when he was released in March 2018.

Inmates who will be supervised on extended supervision get a ride or a bus ticket from the Department of Corrections, she said. But released inmates who do not go on extended supervision are on their own to arrange transportation, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rev. <a href=\"http://www.firstcongmadison.org/content/reverand-jerry-hancock\">Jerry Hancock</a>, director of prison ministry for First Congregational Church of Christ in Madison, said in some cases the Department of Corrections drops inmates at the Capitol Square in Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vinehout says Wisconsin &quot;doesn&#39;t even give&quot; released prison inmates &quot;a bus ticket to get home.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She did not provide any evidence and her claim certainly is not the state&rsquo;s policy, or general practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found is that the state typically provides a ride, or a bus ticket, to released inmates.
