But the story provided no evidence that Pitt said the lines attributed to him in the headline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blog post begins by saying the actor showed up as a meteorologist on <em>The Jim Jefferies Show</em>, &quot;stating some discouraging news about President Donald Trump pulling out the United States of the Paris Climate Change Agreement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pitt indeed made a satirical cameo as an acting meteorologist on May 1, 2018, on <em>The Jim Jefferies Show</em>, a stand-up comedy segment on Comedy Central. But he made no mention of Trump or the Paris climate agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jefferies asked for the weatherman&rsquo;s forecast, Pitt referenced the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/29/donald-trump/trump-gets-polar-ice-trend-backwards/\">melting</a> ice caps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve got sunshine in the West, the South, the East, and over here in the North, the ice caps are melting,&quot; Pitt said. &quot;And I am so, so, so, so, so scared.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on June 6, 2017, five days after Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Pitt had another cameo where he told Jefferies, &quot;There is no future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The line was met with audience laughter and applause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched for articles using Google and the Nexis database that mentioned Pitt saying &quot;Trump is not my president,&quot; but we did not find any documented examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pitt has made comments critical of Trump, which were wrongly attributed to his Jim Jefferies appearance on the post. In an interview with novelist Marlon James that appeared in the <em>New York Times Style Magazine </em>on Sept. 7, 2016, Pitt said, &quot;Man, I never thought Brexit would happen. &nbsp;Same way I can&rsquo;t bring myself to think that Trump will be in charge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything,&quot; Pitt said later in the interview. &quot;What does he even mean, take our country back? Would someone please explain that to me? Where&rsquo;d it go?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline on Conservativetown.com said, &nbsp;&quot;Actor Brad Pitt: &lsquo;Trump Is Not My President, We Have No Future With This&hellip;&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content of the article mostly referenced real quotes, attributed to the wrong sources. They failed to acknowledge the satirical role Pitt was playing on <em>The Jim Jefferies Show</em>.
