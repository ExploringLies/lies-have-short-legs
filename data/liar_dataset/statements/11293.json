This time it&rsquo;s about Carly Fiorina, a rival for the Republican nomination whom Trump mocked by saying &quot;Look at that face!&quot; in front of a <em>Rolling Stone</em> reporter who <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/trump-seriously-20150909?page=13\">published</a> his remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appearing on CBS&rsquo; <em>Face the Nation</em>, Trump contended that his remarks were not about her appearance, but about &quot;her persona&quot; and her track record as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She hasn&rsquo;t done a good job in, you could call it, the private sector. The companies, take a look at the record,&quot; he said <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-september-13-trump-carson-a-battleground-tracker-poll/\">Sept. 13</a>. &quot;The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report. She&rsquo;s one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump rarely cites his sources, so we were curious about the &quot;raging report&quot; by a top dog at Yale University&rsquo;s law school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign did not get back to us by deadline, but we think he is likely referring to an Aug. 14, 2015, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/14/carly-fiorina-president-2/\">column</a> in <em>Fortune</em>&nbsp;by Yale&rsquo;s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The piece did criticize Fiorina&rsquo;s record at HP, but Trump misstated a few things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Sonnenfeld is a <a href=\"http://som.yale.edu/jeffrey-sonnenfeld\">professor and senior associate dean for leadership programs at the Yale School of Management</a>, not &quot;the top man&quot; at Yale Law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, Sonnenfeld didn&rsquo;t name Fiorina as one of the worst executives in <em>his</em> memory. But he told PolitiFact in an interview that &quot;these complaints over her leadership are facts, which she cannot erase by attacking messengers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fired in 2005, after six years in office, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/americas-worst-ceos-where-are-they-now/\">several</a> <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-15-maney_x.htm\">leading</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2009/04/30/Portfolios-Worst-American-CEOs-of-All-Time.html?page=3\">publications</a> titled her one of the worst technology CEOs of all time,&quot; he wrote in<em> Fortune.</em> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a laundry list of Fiorina&rsquo;s failings, according to Sonnenfeld (which includes a nod to Trump himself):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Forcing through a &quot;massive, ill-conceived, controversial&quot; merger with Compaq Computer in 2002 by using &quot;hardball tactics that would make Donald Trump wince,&quot;</li>\r\n\t<li>Completely reversing her stated strategy to emulate competitor IBM&rsquo;s move into IT services,</li>\r\n\t<li>Slicing shareholder wealth in half in five years,</li>\r\n\t<li>Hurting employee morale and poisoning company culture,</li>\r\n\t<li>Cutting <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/barbara-boxer/ad-sen-barbara-boxer-attacks-carly-fiorina-layoffs/\">30,000 U.S. tech jobs</a>,</li>\r\n\t<li>Pocketing in $100 million despite everything.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She was not a criminal nor one of the rogue CEOs of another era and may deserve another chance, but it is telling that in a decade, she has never been given another major company to lead,&quot; Sonnenfeld told us. &quot;Experience can be a badge of honor or a badge of shame.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonnenfeld&rsquo;s assessment of Fiorina is <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/carly-fiorina-presidential-ambitions-follow-a-terrible-record-at-hp-2015-3\">echoed</a> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/08/19/what-carly-fiorinas-multiple-career-screw-ups-say-about-her-leadership-skills/\">by</a> <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/10/news/companies/carly-fiorina-donald-trump-hp-hewlett-packard/\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/business/carly-fiorinas-record-not-so-sterling.html?_r=0\">others</a>, but he stands out as one of her most prominent critics (so much so that Fiorina dismissed him as a Clinton adviser on NBC, which Sonnenfeld denies, and her Super PAC has featured him and his &quot;disreputable past&quot; in a <a href=\"https://carlyforamerica.com/blog/who-is-jeffrey-sonnenfeld/\">blog post</a>). He deemed Fiorina&rsquo;s tenure at HP a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-04-30/what-brought-carly-fiorina-down-at-hp-is-her-greatest-2016-asset\">colossal failure</a>&quot; in Bloomberg in April 2015 and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15143491/ns/business-us_business/t/fiorinas-combative-memoir-well-timed/#.VfXTYr5FiRM\">a reign of terror and poor performance</a>&quot; in a 2006 Associated Press story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You couldn&rsquo;t pick a worse, non-imprisoned CEO to be your standard-bearer,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/us/politics/06fiorina.html\">he told the <em>New York Times</em> in 2008</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Fiorina spokeswoman contended that Fiorina &quot;was a successful CEO by any metric&quot; and said that Sonnenfeld &quot;is a Clinton ally with dubious motives.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a blatantly absurd statement which holds no factual or empirical basis,&quot; Leslie Shedd, press secretary for Fiorina&rsquo;s Super PAC, said. Shedd also pointed out that Trump has disparaged Sonnenfeld in the past (and got his title right) when the latter criticized his NBC reality show, <em>The Apprentice</em>, in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would have to say that he lacks the insight required to understand the architecture of a corporation, and his review reflects that lack of knowledge,&quot; Trump wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB107888561758651103\">letter</a> to the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em> &quot;Perhaps that is why he is a professor at Yale instead of the Wharton School of Finance (my alma mater).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Sonnenfeld and the real estate mogul <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4757288/#.VfXYpb5FiRM\">traded jabs</a>, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/22/donald-trump-attack-tactics/\">Trump apparently</a> invited Sonnenfeld to lunch at Trump National Golf Course and charmed Sonnenfeld&#39;s wife and colleague, much to the Yale professor&rsquo;s horror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report&quot; about former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, saying she is &quot;one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump misses minor points about the Yale man and his message. Sonnenfeld teaches at Yale&rsquo;s business school. He is not the law school&rsquo;s &quot;top man. And Sonnenfeld doesn&rsquo;t exactly say Fiorina is the worst HP CEO in &quot;his memory.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the gist of Trump&rsquo;s claim is accurate, as Sonnenfeld has been a vocal critic of Fiorina&rsquo;s HP record for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s claim is missing some detail but is overall on point about Sonnenfeld&rsquo;s long-running critique of Fiorina.
