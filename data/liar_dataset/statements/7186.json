The group stresses that many ordinary citizens have joined the effort, which was co-founded nationally by former Republican U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, the former Clinton administration official. The pair co-chaired the Obama-created National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. Fix the Debt has attracted a bipartisan roster of supporters from the ranks of elected officials and former officials.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group referred in its news release to the Pew Center on the States, which issued a report on Nov. 15, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.pewstates.org/uploadedFiles/PCS_Assets/2012/Pew_fiscal_cliff_report.pdf\">&quot;The Impact of the Fiscal Cliff on the States.</a>&quot; That report relied on figures from the Federal Funds Information for States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report did use an 18 percent number in regards to federal grants to states for programs such as Title 1 education grants, special education, Head Start, nutrition for low-income women and children, and public housing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it was describing the pool of federal funds subject to some level of sequestration cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPew officials said they did not mean that the entire pool comprised of that 18 percent would be eliminated entirely, as Fix the Debt said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Pew estimated that 7 percent of that pot of money would actually be eliminated, or perhaps slightly higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot chump change, but a far cry from all of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFix the Debt officials said they made an editing error in preparing the release, and became aware of it when we called.
