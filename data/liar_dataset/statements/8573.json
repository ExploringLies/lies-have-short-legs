The latest comes from the Arkansas Senate race, where incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, faces U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, they traded jabs over Medicare funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIyV700XLFk%20\"><u>Pryor&rsquo;s ad said</u></a>. &quot;Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjhyr0J3Wsc\"><u>Cotton&rsquo;s ad shot back</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve addressed Pryor&rsquo;s claim in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/mark-pryor/rep-tom-cotton-voted-make-medicare-voucher-system-/\">separate fact-check</a>. Here, we&rsquo;ll focus on Cotton&rsquo;s assertion that the Affordable Care Act strips Medicare funding. Cotton&rsquo;s office didn&rsquo;t respond to our requests for comment, but we did hear from Pryor&rsquo;s folks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cuts-716-medicare-pay-obamacare/\"><u>certainly</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-president-obama-funneled-716-billio/\"><u>no</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/20/60-plus-association/medicare-cuts-health-care-law-will-hurt-seniors-sa/\"><u>stranger</u></a> to different versions of this claim. There is a connection between the Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicare funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both parties have recognized a need to rein in Medicare costs, which were growing at an annual rate of <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/apps/docs/aca-update-implementing-medicare-costs-savings.pdf\"><u>6.8 percent</u></a> in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Without reform, the nation&rsquo;s already excessive health care spending would have reached unsustainable levels within the next few decades,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/apps/docs/aca-update-implementing-medicare-costs-savings.pdf\"><u>2010 CMS report</u></a> read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the enactment of the health care law,<strong> </strong>Medicare&rsquo;s growth was projected to slow to 5.3 percent, according to the same CMS report. Over time, CMS predicts this will result in a 10-year savings of more than $700 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The savings will come from reductions to Medicare Advantage, which represents a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. In additions, hospitals will be paid less if they don&rsquo;t meet certain benchmarks for patient care. The law&rsquo;s intent was to save money by making the system more efficient and without making reductions in benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Obamacare doesn&rsquo;t &quot;cut&quot; Medicare funding that already exists. Rather, it controls future spending, which politicians on both sides of the aisle called for. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost control &quot;is part of what Congress does to try to manage the insanely complex and expensive Medicare system,&quot; said Jay Wolfson, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. &quot;It is not new, nor is it partisan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Mark Pryor <a href=\"http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/senate/1/396\"><u>voted with the Senate</u></a> to pass Obamacare in 2009, he wasn&rsquo;t voting to cut Medicare. He was voting to slow its growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to reallocate some of the money saved toward Obamacare&rsquo;s goal of covering the currently uninsured, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University health policy law professor. So the savings are designed to offset costs in Obamacare so that the law doesn&rsquo;t increase the national deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cotton&rsquo;s ad claimed that &quot;Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare.&quot; In reality, the Affordable Care Act calls for a slowed growth of Medicare funding, not a slash to current funds. The savings from this approach will be used to offset Obamacare costs. Because the ad doesn&rsquo;t make this clear, we rate Cotton&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-19T17:34:08.219990", "ruling_date": "2013-11-19T17:54:38", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
