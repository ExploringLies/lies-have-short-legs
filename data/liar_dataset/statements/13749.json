In fact, 11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million (in) credit. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar attacks about 11 wealthy individuals were made in TV interviews earlier <a href=\"http://wpt.org/here-and-now/rep-barca-responds-state-state-address\">in the month by</a> other Democratic state lawmakers, including Assembly Minority Leader <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/peter-barca/\">Peter Barca</a> of Kenosha <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsinites-split-on-whether-to-raise-gas-tax-for-transportation-fund/8575549\">and by</a> state Rep. Dianne Hesselbein of Middleton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s check Hintz&rsquo;s claim that &quot;11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million&quot; in credits from the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A note before we dig in:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hintz&rsquo;s statement could be read to mean 11 individuals who each make over $30 million <em>each got a $22 million credit</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s clear from Hintz&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0124hintz.pdf\">prior</a> <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/assembly/54/hintz/media/1172/hintz-release_21-million.pdf\">statements</a> he meant 11 individuals who each make $30 million <em>got a total of $22 million in credits</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Previous attack</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manufacturing and agriculture tax credit was inserted by Republican lawmakers into Walker&rsquo;s first state budget, which was adopted in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The credit didn&rsquo;t take effect until 2013 and wasn&rsquo;t fully phased in until 2016. It gradually reduced the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses to nearly nothing -- from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The credit&rsquo;s benefit to the rich became an issue in the 2014 congressional race between Democrat <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mark-harris/\">Mark Harris</a> and Republican <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/glenn-grothman/\">Glenn Grothman</a>, which Grothman won. Harris claimed that as a state senator, Grothman pushed through the credit and that once it was phased in, &quot;someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income&quot; will pay &quot;less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/14/mark-harris/new-wisconsin-tax-breaks-will-let-factory-owners-p/\">Mostly True</a>. We found that some factory owners who earn up to roughly $2.5 million from production income would owe less in state income tax on that income than a full-time worker who earns minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is the tax so tilted that it overwhelmingly benefits 11 people?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hintz provided us a <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/eupdates/asm54/2017%20MAC%20Distributional%20Table_.pdf\">January 2017 memo</a> he requested from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The memo reported on figures provided by the state Department of Revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the memo:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Based on income tax returns filed for tax year 2015, it&rsquo;s estimated that in tax year 2017, a total of 10,613 claimants will take manufacturing and agriculture credits worth $227 million. (A claimant&nbsp;can be an individual or a married couple.)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Included are 11 claimants who each have an income of $30 million or more. Their total credit is estimated at $22.2 million. (The 11 aren&#39;t identified.)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Casey Langan, a spokesman for the Department of Revenue, confirmed the accuracy of the figures in Hintz&rsquo;s claim. But he pointed out they are estimates and added:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Large incomes would reflect large amounts of production activities and therefore attract a sizable credit. These claimants are business owners who are stimulating Wisconsin&#39;s economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vice president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce has <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-s-sweeping-manufacturing-and-agriculture-tax-credit-reaches-full/article_21300bb8-3ea3-5210-9596-b1a0ad287f0e.html\">praised the credit</a>, saying it allows manufacturers &quot;to compete effectively by essentially allowing them to operate tax free in Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/the-big-giveaway-is-getting-bigger-updated-figures-show-growing-tax-credit-is-inefficient-costly\">says the estimated $299 million</a> in lost income tax revenue in fiscal 2017 from the credit is &quot;giving a higher priority to giving tax cuts for the best-off&quot; rather than making investments in schools and universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax credit earned Walker a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/553/cut-manufacturing-taxes/\">Promise Kept</a> on our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/\">Walk-O-Meter</a> for his campaign pledge to cut manufacturing taxes. It also helped him get a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/566/review-all-tax-policy-to-lighten-burden-on-farmers/\">Promise Kept</a> on a pledge to review all tax policy to lighten burden on farmers and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/551/reduce-taxes-on-employers/\">Promise Kept</a> on a promise to reduce taxes on employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hintz said &quot;11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million (in) credit&quot; from Wisconsin&#39;s manufacturing and agriculture tax credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figures are essentially solid, coming from the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau estimates that 11 claimants (individuals or married couples) who each earn over $30 million will share a total of $22 million in credits. But those are estimates, for 2017, not credits actually received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.</p> <div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"7e655d31-3f82-41ca-b931-c1bb213d8dd6\" style=\"width: 100%;
