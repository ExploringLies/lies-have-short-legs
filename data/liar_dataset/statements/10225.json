A recent claim circulating on the Internet says she does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader recently sent us a November <a href=\"http://americannews.com/congress-approves-bill-offering-free-cars-to-welfare-recipients/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>American News article</u></a> that says welfare recipients will be eligible for a free vehicle and receive a monthly $100 gas card beginning Jan. 15 under new legislation proposed by President Barack Obama. The article said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Recently, the White House announced a plan to offer free vehicles to welfare recipients. According to reports, the bill passed in a narrow vote. The program was initiated by President Barack Obama, and in many way mirrors what has become known as &lsquo;The Obama Phone&rsquo;, or the program through which welfare recipients can get free cell phone service.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;John Earnest announced the program launch, stating &lsquo;The free automobile program gives low-income Americans the opportunity to take ownership of a vehicle at no cost, and will also include a monthly gas card for $100.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that this passing will be the downfall of President Obama.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot; &lsquo;This absurd plan that the democrats have conjured up is beyond belief. I have no idea how or why congress passed this,&rsquo; McConnell stated.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story earned more than 80,000 Facebook likes by Nov. 17, but here&rsquo;s the deal: It&#39;s not accurate. There was no such bill proposed by the Obama administration, and Congress did not pass any such measure. The White House spokesman is Josh Earnest, not John Earnest. (The premise is also kind of amusing -- Congress hasn&rsquo;t been in the habit of passing Obama initiatives for some time now, whether by a &quot;narrow&quot; margin or not.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, the claim originated at an acknowledged fake-news site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s dispense with the old claim about &quot;Obama phones.&quot; This claim is, at best, greatly exaggerated. We&rsquo;ve checked various versions and found that their accuracy rated from <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/mar/15/steve-stockman/steve-stockman-says-president-spending-22-billion-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly False</u></a> to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/19/blog-posting/immigrants-would-get-free-cell-phones-under-new-pr/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>False</u></a> to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/31/adam-putnam/putnam-obama-campaign-gives-free-cell-phones-suppo/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pants on Fire</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the idea that the federal government has established a welfare program involving no-cost gas cards and cars for low-income Americans -- well, this is pure fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://empirenews.net/congress-approves-bill-that-will-offer-free-automobiles-to-welfare-recipients/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>story</u></a> was originally posted on Empire News in August.
