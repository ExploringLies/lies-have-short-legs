Facebook users tagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to fight fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said Hart, 38, lost control of his car in Summerlin, Nev., on Monday night, corresponding to the first time we saw the post on Sept. 18, 2017. Summerlin is a planned community west of Las Vegas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post said Hart had been exceeding the 25 mph speed limit and went off the road, hitting a guardrail. Hart was allegedly taken to MountainView Hospital, a real hospital in Summerlin, and remained in critical condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This accident never happened, mind you, because the post is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo the website used was of a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1313637/Miracle-escape-sleeping-driver-impaled-car-crash-barrier.html?ITO=1490\">2010 accident in Montana</a>, in which a college student had fallen asleep and hit a guardrail that speared his car but missed the driver by inches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been no reports that Hart was in any car accident, let alone was injured. He has been posting on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevinHart4real\">social media accounts</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kevinhart4real/\">since then</a>, which the fake post actually used in its writeup of the bogus crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second half of the NYDailyNews-TV.com post went on about how Hart had confessed online the day prior about how he had made a &quot;bad error in judgment&quot; that had affected his family and made him a target of extortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hart had posted an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZHqi5_n_Vu/\">Instagram video on Sept. 16</a> with the caption, &quot;Sending so many apologies to my wife &amp; kids. I gotta do better and I will.
