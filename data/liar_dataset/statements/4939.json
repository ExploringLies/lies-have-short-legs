Sen. Pat Roberts, the committee&rsquo;s ranking member, said subpoenaing Corzine was an unprecedented measure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s the first time, I think, in history where a former senator has been subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues,&quot; Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said in an interview on Fox Business News on Dec. 6, when the Senate committee voted to compel Corzine to testify.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring last week&rsquo;s vote, Roberts said that &quot;based on consultations with the Senate historian&rsquo;s office, it is also unclear if any former member of the Senate has been compelled to testify before a Senate committee. It is our understanding that such action could be a first.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with the Senate historian&rsquo;s office and found that, as far as they know, Roberts is right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFormer senators have been forced to testify before a House committee, but Corzine is the first former senator known to be subpoenaed by a Senate committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCorzine served as the chairman and CEO of MF Global, which went bankrupt this fall. During the company&rsquo;s collapse, as much as $1.2 billion in client money disappeared.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKatherine Scott, an assistant historian at the U.S. Senate Historical Office, noted limits to definitively identifying former senators subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees. &quot;Subpoena documents are kept with committee files at the National Archives. Hearing transcripts were not methodically collected prior to the early 20th century,&quot; she said in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, the Senate historian&rsquo;s office found one instance where two former senators were forced to testify before a House committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1908, &nbsp;Matthew Butler of South Carolina and Marion Butler of North Carolina were subpoenaed and testified before a House committee investigating the lobbying tactics of the Electric Boat Company of New Jersey and their predecessors, the Holland Boat Company.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe two former senators, who were not related, denied any wrongdoing in their work with the companies, which built submarines, and no charges were brought against the former lawmakers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo that&rsquo;s an example of former senators being forced to testify before a House committee. But as far as the U.S. Senate Historical Office knows, Corzine is the first senator subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Terry Madonna, the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Pennsylvania, said Corzine won&rsquo;t be the last.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Senate to be sure is very precedent driven--so once this precedent has been established, you can bet it won&#39;t be the last time it will happen,&quot; he said. But he also noted that the MF Global issue is &quot;unusually salient because of the heightened interest in the actions of the investment community in general and Wall Street in particular.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoberts claimed that Jon Corzine is the first former senator to be &quot;subpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCorzine is the first senator to be compelled to testify before Congress in more than 100 years. And as far as Senate historian&rsquo;s office knows, he&rsquo;s the first to be subpoenaed to testify in front of a Senate committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on that information, we rate Roberts&rsquo; statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/politifact_nj_jon_corzine_sen.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-13T16:07:30.287609", "ruling_date": "2011-12-14T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Pat Roberts claims Jon Corzine is the first former Senator to be \u201csubpoenaed to testify before his former colleagues.\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "pat-roberts-claims-jon-corzine-first-former-senato", "ruling_link_text": "As far as the Senate historian knows", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOln5blV5kk\">Roberts Talks MF Global, Corzine Subpoena on FOX Biz News</a>, posted Dec. 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Katherine Scott, assistant historian for the <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Senate_Historical_Office.htm\">U.S. Senate Historical Office</a>, Dec. 8 - 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Sarah Little, communications director for <a href=\"http://roberts.senate.gov/public/\">U.S. Sen.
