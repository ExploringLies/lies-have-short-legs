Bruecker analyzed 194,495 applications for teaching vacancies in public school districts between January and October of 2014. The data came from a job-application website, the Wisconsin Education Career Access Network, and included those newly entering the profession as well as existing teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers comment that &quot;less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin&quot; doesn&rsquo;t square with the study&rsquo;s findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some key findings from the study:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- 54 percent of prospective teachers did not apply for any vacancies in a rural school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- 40 percent applied to multiple types of districts, including rural ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Less than 5 percent applied only to rural vacancies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That last conclusion reflects the claim made by Evers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if that fact is what he was thinking of, his claim didn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than 5 percent of applicants applied exclusively to rural districts, but a total of 45 percent showed interest in rural vacancies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goff said there is clearly an aversion to rural districts for many applicants. Another piece of evidence for that: The average applicant submits only 15 percent of their applications to rural vacancies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, &quot;applicant pools in rural districts don&rsquo;t look any different than applicant pools in urban areas or towns,&quot; Goff told us. They have the same number of applicants, on average, with similar levels of experience, certification, advanced degrees and competitiveness of undergraduate institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers claimed a study of where teachers apply to work found that &quot;less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study found that schools in cities, suburbs or towns all draw more interest than rural districts, but Evers badly overstated the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>div class=&#39;artembed&#39;&gt;See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-30T17:04:34.181138", "ruling_date": "2017-03-31T10:57:02", "ruling_headline": "State school superintendent misses on claim that 5 percent of teachers want to work in rural schools", "ruling_headline_slug": "state-school-superintendent-misses-claim-5-percent", "ruling_link_text": "More like 45 percent", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Tony Evers interview, <a href=\"http://wxpr.org/post/evers-says-teacher-shortage-major-problem-rural-wisconsin\">WXPR public radio story </a>aired March 13, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Thomas McCarthy, Department of Public Instruction spokesman, March 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Amanda Brink, Evers campaign spokesperson, March 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Peter Goff, professor, Educational Leadership &amp; Policy Analysis, University of Wisconsin-Madison, March 29-30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Draft study, &quot;The Role of Place: Labor Market Dynamics in Rural and Non-rural School Districts,&quot; Peter Goff and Ellie M.
