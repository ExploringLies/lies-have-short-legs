The story said Francis told the guests that the religious teachings were equally valid, and that the time is ripe for &quot;merging our faiths.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts with PolitiFact and other fact-checking websites to debunk potentially fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, we can find no evidence Francis ever said such a thing, although the story persists on Facebook with links tracking back to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Pope%20Francis%20To%20Followers%3A%20%E2%80%9CKoran%20And%20Holy%20Bible%20Are%20The%20Same%E2%80%9D\">a variety of websites</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post refers to the Monday prior to its publication, which would have been Dec. 19. Francis did speak to a group that day, telling Italian children to <a href=\"http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/12/19/listen-to-your-grandparents-and-reap-their-wisdom-pope-tells-children/\">spend time with their grandparents</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/usa-snich/\">USA Snich</a> is another website that appears to mix fake news and real events, sometimes posting stories that are entirely fabricated like this one. As its &quot;source,&quot; it shared a non-working link to the website <a href=\"http://washingtonpost.com.co/pope-francis-to-followers-koran-and-holy-bible-are-the-same/\">WashingtonPost.com.co</a>. Websites with .co after a legitimate media outlet&rsquo;s name often are associated with fake news, like <a href=\"http://abcnews.com.co/\">ABCNews.com.co</a> and <a href=\"http://nbc.com.co/\">NBC.com.co</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were able to track the original story to a <a href=\"http://nationalreport.net/pope-francis-followers-koran-holy-bible/\">2015 post</a> on NationalReport.net, which says in <a href=\"http://nationalreport.net/disclaimer/\">its disclaimer</a> that it is &quot;a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like USA Snich, the story appears word-for-word on a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Pope+Francis+To+Followers%3A+%E2%80%9CKoran+And+Holy+Bible+Are+The+Same%E2%80%9D\">variety of websites</a> that share fake news, like <a href=\"http://civictribune.com/pope-francis-at-white-house-koran-and-holy-bible-are-the-same/\">CivicTribune.com</a> and <a href=\"http://dailynewsposts.info/pope-francis-to-followers-koran-and-holy-bible-are-the-same\">DailyNewsPosts.info</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of them are correct, because the original story is made up.
