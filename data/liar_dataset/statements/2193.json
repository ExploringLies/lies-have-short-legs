If you don&#39;t have a hour, we&#39;ll just sum it up by saying the two men clearly don&#39;t like each other.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe plan to check a few items from the debate. In this fact check, we wanted to focus on one exchange dealing with McCollum&#39;s government credentials as the state&#39;s attorney general.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring one of the more heated moments, Scott accused McCollum of failing to control state spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you look at history, when state budgets grow versus the size of the private sector, jobs go away,&quot; Scott said. &quot;While you&#39;ve been attorney general it&#39;s exploded. You&#39;ve done nothing to stop it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m going to reduce the size of government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcCollum responded, &quot;In my attorney general&#39;s office, we&#39;ve cut the budget by 18 percent. I do know how to run a business. I have run the attorney general&#39;s office. It has 12 offices around the state. It has 1,400 employees.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcCollum&#39;s facts about the offices and employees are close enough and noncontroversial (it&#39;s about 1,300 employees in 12 offices) that we&#39;re not going to check them. But we do want to explore the claim that McCollum has cut his budget 18 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&#39;s Office of Policy and Budget suggested we turned to the state&#39;s fiscal website, <a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/\" id=\"ga-c\" title=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us\">http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us</a>. The site tracks budget figures by agency starting with the year 2000. For our purposes, we wanted to check the attorney general&#39;s budget figures starting in fiscal year 2006-2007, which was the budget passed the year before McCollum took office. That way, we&#39;d track all the budget changes McCollum made.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat we found shows that the total budget for the attorney general&#39;s office actually grew since McCollum took office, from about $173 million in 2006 to about $186 million this year. That&#39;s a 7.5 percent increase, not an 18 percent cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the attorney general&#39;s office for an explanation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat we got is another lesson in why government is, well, government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Now entering the bureaucratic mess of state budgeting.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the attorney general&#39;s office has a budget of $186 million, lots of that budget is carved out into pieces that head in directions outside of&nbsp;McCollum&#39;s control.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcCollum&#39;s office provided us with a spreadsheet that attempts to make sense of things. Click <a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag6LtLEJqtdcdGxwRDRTQlVsV3F0QTl5SVR5aC1xMnc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CNKavvEB\" id=\"yt0a\" title=\"here\">here</a> to read it yourself, if you can make sense of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the AG&#39;s $186 million budget, just about 20 percent comes from general revenues, and therefore is available to spent as McCollum sees fit. That money funds the statewide prosecutor, pays for criminal appellate division of the attorney general&#39;s office, funds McCollum&#39;s cyber crimes task force, etc.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rest of the money is tied up in trust funds that have a specific purpose, and often simply pass through the attorney general&#39;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA couple of examples:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe attorney general&#39;s budget this year includes almost $37 million in federal money for victims&#39; funds. That&#39;s money allocated to states based on a federal&nbsp;formula and is&nbsp;paid out to victims of a crime. Another $14.6 million in federal dollars are allocated specifically to fight against Medicaid fraud. Under that program, for every $1 the state spends through its general revenue fund, the federal government will kick in $3.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoney to fund the Florida Elections Commission is included in McCollum&#39;s budget, though he has no control over it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPass-through funding, as the AG&#39;s office calls it, accounts for more than $60 million this year alone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rest of the attorney general&#39;s budget is paid for, ostensibly, by other state agencies who hire McCollum&#39;s lawyers. If the Department of Children and Families, for instance, pays for the equivalent of 20 lawyers, they would get 20 lawyers. If they pay for 10, they get 10. If they pay for zero, you get the point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExcluding the pass-through trust funds and the money spent on AG lawyers by other agencies, the attorney general&#39;s operational budget shrunk from $48.6 million in 2007 to $42.9 million this year, a dip of about $5.7 million, according to the AG&#39;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we think using the 2006 number is more fair, because that accounts for any increase in the budget McCollum made in his first year in office. Using the 2006 number, $47.4 million, McCollum has trimmed the attorney general&#39;s operational budget about $4.5 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTranslated into a percentage, that comes to about 9.5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what gives?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Now going deeper into the bureaucratic mess of state budgeting.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe attorney general&#39;s most recent budget includes a special one-time $3.5 million allocation for Crime Stoppers. The money will be used to pay for enhancing public awareness of crime prevention methods and to train the public in personal safety principles.<a href=\"http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/b307a15f7ab2a3a185256cd000710bda\" id=\"d55e\" title=\"Typically Crime Stoppers had been funded by a $20 fine tacked on to criminal convictions, money that is then put into a trust fund.\"> Typically Crime Stoppers had been funded by a $20 fine tacked on to criminal convictions, money that is then put into a trust fund.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the Legislature zeroed out the trust fund to pay for other costs. <a href=\"http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/b307a15f7ab2a3a185256cd000710bda\" id=\"cv0-\" title=\"So the money was reinserted into the attorney general's operational fund for 2010 only, in order to allow time for the trust fund to be rebuilt.\">So the money was reinserted into the attorney general&#39;s operational fund for 2010 only, in order to allow time for the trust fund to be rebuilt.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat shifts the budgeted amount McCollum controls down again, to $39.4 million in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s $8 million less than what was budgeted in 2006, or a 16.9 percent decrease.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcCollum said matter-of-factly that he has cut the attorney general&#39;s budget 18 percent since he took office. The line leaves viewers, pretty clearly in our minds, the impression that McCollum cut the entire attorney general&#39;s budget. In fact, we know now, that he&#39;s just talking about a small portion of AG spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe acknowledge and agree that there are lots of dollars tucked in the $186 million spending plan that McCollum cannot control, and we also note that McCollum has lowered spending in the core areas of the AG&#39;s office he oversees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we think he missed an opportunity to be&nbsp;more clear with voters. We rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-06T14:49:50.529546", "ruling_date": "2010-08-06T18:57:46", "ruling_headline": "Bill McCollum says he slashed the attorney general's budget 18 percent", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-mccollum-says-he-slashed-attorney-generals-bu", "ruling_link_text": "Talking about only a small portion of the budget", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFox 13, <a href=\"http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/subindex/news/politics/florida_politics\">Rick Scott/Bill McCollum debate</a>, Aug. 5, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGovernor&#39;s office, e-mail interview with Sterling Ivey, Aug. 5, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlorida Fiscal portal, <a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/\">budget documents FY2006/2007-FY2010/2011</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAttorney General&#39;s office, interview with Ryan Wiggins, Aug. 5, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAttorney General&#39;s office, <a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag6LtLEJqtdcdGxwRDRTQlVsV3F0QTl5SVR5aC1xMnc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CNKavvEB\">budget spreadsheet</a>, Aug. 5, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlorida Sheriff&#39;s Association, <a href=\"http://www.sheriffleefl.org/prevention/bills/FSA_Legislative_Agenda_for_2010.pdf\">Crime Stoppers legislative priority</a>, March 18, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAttorney General&#39;s office, <a href=\"http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/b307a15f7ab2a3a185256cd000710bda\">Crime Stoppers grant program</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 325, "last_name": "McCollum", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "bill-mccollum", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bill_McCollum.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/325/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 3, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;In my attorney general&#39;s office, we&#39;ve cut the budget 18 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate.", "statement_date": "2010-08-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
