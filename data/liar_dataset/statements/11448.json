But CNN thinks Hillary won. Even though CNN&rsquo;s own polls say Bernie won by 68 percent. But that doesn&rsquo;t concern them. They allegedly just deleted the polls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video suggests CNN &quot;deleted the polls&quot; showing Sanders won because CNN&rsquo;s parent company, Time Warner, is &quot;one of Hillary&rsquo;s biggest donors,&quot; spending more on her campaign than &quot;Bernie&rsquo;s top 15 donors gave him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is just one example of a viral claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, we will skip the part about the conspiracy that focuses on Time Warner&rsquo;s campaign donations, because there&rsquo;s a fundamental flaw with these posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN didn&rsquo;t delete its poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poll showing Sanders way ahead is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cnn/app_1667241686824039\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;on Facebook through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cnn/app_1667241686824039\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>CNN.com/vote.</u></a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not on CNN&rsquo;s website, but it&rsquo;s not clear that it ever was on CNN&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original link does not appear to be working on some mobile devices.&nbsp;Try <a href=\"http://cnn.ipowow.com/debate\">this link</a>&nbsp;if you are having problems with the links above.
