Scott Walker had it two ways while defending his state&rsquo;s economic record during a stop in Minnesota as he <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">moves toward a 2016 presidential bid</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some media outlets interpreted his remarks as pushing back on the idea that Wisconsin&rsquo;s economic recovery trails that of Minnesota, where Democrat Mark Dayton is governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-heads-to-minnesota-thursday-b99487087z1-301054971.html\">Walker also spoke</a> of Minnesota&rsquo;s &quot;advantage&quot; in terms of economic growth and attributed it to politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For many years, when (Republican Gov. Tim) Pawlenty was in office, the state was doing quite well,&quot; Walker said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve had the advantage of having, other than a two-year period, Republicans in charge of at least one part of government for at least some time,&quot; Walker added, then noted. &quot;Before we came into office, for many years there was a Democratic governor, a Democratic Assembly and a Democratic Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t fact check Walker&rsquo;s implication that Wisconsin fell behind because Democrats were running the whole show. That&rsquo;s his opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we can check his facts on who was in charge and when.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker didn&rsquo;t say how far back his comparison went, but his mention of Pawlenty suggests at least 2003, when Pawlenty was first elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we found when examining partisan control in both states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minnesota</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pawlenty served two terms, from 2003 through 2010, giving way to Dayton at the same time Walker assumed power in Madison in January 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that means Republicans controlled at least one key lever for those eight years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2011 to present it&rsquo;s been Dayton, a member of the state&rsquo;s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, in the governor&rsquo;s chair in St. Paul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans held both legislative chambers in 2011-12, and one starting in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Democrats -- as Walker correctly noted -- ran both chambers from 2013-14 and of course had Dayton for those years as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker confined his argument here to the years before he took office in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he misfires in saying Democrats had a total lock on power for &quot;many years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle took office in Wisconsin in 2003 -- at the same time Pawlenty assumed control next door. Doyle also served eight years, then decided not to run for a third term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Doyle only had a Legislature under total Democratic control for his last two years, 2009 and 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Republicans controlled the Assembly and Senate for Doyle&rsquo;s first four years. Control then was split for two years before Democrats enjoyed their brief unfettered reign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going back further, to 1995, Republicans in Wisconsin controlled at least one of the three power spots every year until 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kind of single-party dominance that Walker claimed Democrats have enjoyed for many years is rare in recent Wisconsin history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker, though, is now in year five with Republicans gripping all three levers of authority at the Capitol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said Minnesota&rsquo;s &quot;advantage&quot; has been having &quot;Republicans in charge of at least one part of government&quot; for all but two years, while Wisconsin Democrats &quot;for many years&quot; controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship before 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making the comparison, though, he overstates how long the Democrats had total control in Wisconsin. It was for a two-year period, before he took office and Republicans won complete control. The Republicans have had that status more than twice as long as the &quot;many years&quot; Walker said Democrats did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-28T10:48:39.850332", "ruling_date": "2015-04-29T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrats had total control of state politics for \"many years,\" Scott Walker says", "ruling_headline_slug": "democrats-had-total-control-state-politics-many-ye", "ruling_link_text": "Two years isn't all that \"many\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-heads-to-minnesota-thursday-b99487087z1-301054971.html\">&quot;Scott Walker defends Wisconsin economy on Minnesota visit,&quot;</a> April 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KMSP-TV, <a href=\"http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/28881216/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-makes-minnesota-visit\">&quot;Wisconsin Gov.
