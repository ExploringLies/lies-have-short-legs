He&rsquo;s called him a disappointment.&quot; For emphasis, she later repeated the charge that Sanders had used the words &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;disappointment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did he? We found lots of examples of Sanders prodding Obama to take a more aggressively liberal approach to governing, and we have previously found <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/martin-omalley/fact-checking-martin-omalleys-claim-bernie-sanders/\">some truth</a> to the charge that Sanders had tried to find someone to challenge Obama in a primary when he was running for a second term in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the specific charge Clinton made -- that Sanders used the words &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;disappointment&quot; &nbsp;-- were at best exaggerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two examples when Sanders used one or both of those words, both of which are murkier than Clinton lets on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One is an interview Sanders gave broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8N8E1v7E58#t=28\">Thom Hartmann</a> on July 22, 2011. Sanders lamented that Obama, in his view, had moved too far to the right politically. But while Sanders used the words Clinton cited, he didn&rsquo;t say that he himself felt that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, Sanders said, &quot;I think there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president, who cannot believe how weak he has been &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; in negotiating with Republicans. And there&rsquo;s deep disappointment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note Sanders&rsquo; language: He says &quot;millions of Americans&quot; feel that way, not that he did so himself. It&rsquo;s a small difference, but we think a significant one given the forcefulness of Clinton&rsquo;s attack line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other example we found came on Nov. 13, 2011, when <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2011/11/some-dems-refuse-to-back-obama-068266?o=1\">Politico</a> reported that Sanders would not say whether he would support Obama for re-election (though he ultimately did).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Politico article quoted Sanders saying that Obama should &quot;stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it&rsquo;s a little bit early in the process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, Sanders said Obama had reached weak agreements with his political adversaries, not that Obama himself was personally weak. Once again, this is more nuanced than Clinton&rsquo;s assertion made it out to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that Sanders has used other words to distance himself from Obama&rsquo;s policies and approach to governing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, in July 2015, Sanders told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/16/bernie-sanders-on-americas-grotesquely-unfair-society/\">Jim Tankersley</a>, a writer for the <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Wonkblog, &quot;In many respects, the president was not strong enough on many issues. For example, he&rsquo;s wrong on the trade issue, dead wrong. Also, the president made a mistake, that after his brilliant campaign of 2008, he essentially said to his most motivated supporters, thanks very much for electing me, but I&rsquo;ll go from here on my own. I&rsquo;ll sit down and negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell, and I really don&rsquo;t need you anymore. Terrible mistake. Because the only way forward, to bring forth a progressive agenda, is to have the American people mobilized.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is certainly a critical assessment of Obama&rsquo;s tenure, but it doesn&rsquo;t include the words &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;disappointment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said Sanders has called Obama &quot;weak. He&#39;s called him a disappointment.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders has critiqued Obama and used those words to describe the feelings of Americans, or to describe Obama&rsquo;s policies. But Sanders did not specifically call Obama &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;a disappointment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-11T23:12:36.920593", "ruling_date": "2016-02-12T00:16:32", "ruling_headline": "Did Bernie Sanders call President Barack Obama 'weak' and 'a disappointment'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-bernie-sanders-call-president-barack-obama-wea", "ruling_link_text": "He expressed criticism, but not with those words", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, remarks during the Democratic presidential debate in Milwaukee, Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernie Sanders, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8N8E1v7E58\">comments on the Thom Hartmann Program</a>, July 22, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2011/11/some-dems-refuse-to-back-obama-068266?o=1\">Some Dems refuse to back Obama</a>,&quot; Nov. 13, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/16/bernie-sanders-on-americas-grotesquely-unfair-society/\">Bernie Sanders on America&rsquo;s &lsquo;grotesquely unfair&rsquo; society</a>,&quot; July 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org, &quot;FactChecking the Fourth Democratic Debate,&quot; Jan. 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/martin-omalley/fact-checking-martin-omalleys-claim-bernie-sanders/\">Fact-checking Martin O&#39;Malley&#39;s claim that Bernie Sanders sought primary challenger to Obama</a>,&quot; Nov. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Warren Gunnels, spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Hillary Clinton, Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Sen.
