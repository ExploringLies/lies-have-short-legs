Why wouldn&#39;t I be?,&quot; Trump said on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/01/politics/donald-trump-immigrants-raping-comments/index.html\">July 1</a>. &quot;I went to the Wharton School of Finance, I was a great student. ... I go out, I make a tremendous fortune. I write a book called <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, the No. 1 selling business book of all time, at least I think, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it is. And certainly a big monster, the No. 1 bestseller. I do <em>The Apprentice</em>, a tremendous success, one of the most successful shows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious about Trump&rsquo;s literary credentials. Did he pen the top-selling business book of all time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Trump-The-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0345479173\">The Art of the Deal</a></em>, a memoir that offers readers 11 steps for business success, was a smash when first published in November 1987. Trump hosted a celebrity-filled launch party, landed on the covers of magazines and toured the late night talk show circuit to promote and discuss the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The momentum around the book was tremendous,&quot; wrote journalist Timothy L. O&rsquo;Brien <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=axK-7t8kolQC&amp;pg=PT69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">in a biography of the mogul</a>. &quot;The voice that sprang from the pages was entirely original, seemingly candid, relentlessly boastful and refreshingly unafraid to take swipes, settle scores, and opine with an I-am-what-I-am gusto.<em> The Art of the Deal </em>was a tour of the business world according to Mister Id, and readers ate it up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It spent 51 weeks on the&nbsp;<em>New York Times&#39;</em> bestseller list and, according to some <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-business-philosophy-from-the-art-of-the-deal-2015-6\">reports</a>, sold 1 million copies. Neither the Trump campaign nor the book&rsquo;s publisher got back to us, so we were unable to verify this figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, we looked at data from Nielsen Bookscan. The data isn&#39;t perfect. For one, it counts sales only since 2001. And for another, it only&nbsp;tallies the number of print copies sold by major booksellers (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3GSXHR8ZL1HNXY0ZzdwWkdCOTBCcWhMV1ktLWlmbUZQdmtN/view?usp=sharing\">about 85 percent of the market</a>). &nbsp;According to Nielsen data, <em>The Art of the Deal</em> has sold about 177,000 copies in all its editions:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Published</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Binding type</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Publisher</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Sales since 2001</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Nov. 1, 1987</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Hardcover</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Random House</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>17,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Jan. 1, 1989</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mass market paperback</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Random House</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>90,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Dec. 1, 2004</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mass market paperback</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Hachette Book Group</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>70,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to weigh Trump&rsquo;s opus against other &quot;business books&quot; for two reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, best-seller lists are almost always periodical. Amazon tallies sales by the hour, while the <em>New York Times</em>&rsquo; lists are by week or by month. Greg Cowles, who writes for the<em> New York Times</em> &quot;Inside the List&quot; column, says the paper doesn&rsquo;t track all-time sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the genre called &quot;business books&quot; is nebulous and can range from memoirs and essays to financial tips and management strategies. Trump&rsquo;s book can certainly be shelved in the business section, as it&rsquo;s both a memoir by a business executive and offers business advice. But experts say it can hardly count as influential in the subcategories or important in the broader genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Trump is full of B.S.,&quot; said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of business management at Stanford University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Business. &quot;The best selling/most important business books would have to be<em> </em><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Search-Excellence-Americas-Best-Run-Companies/dp/0060150424/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=\">In Search of Excellence</a></em> by (Thomas) Peters and (Robert) Waterman that started the genre, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Built-Last-Successful-Visionary-Essentials/dp/0060516402/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436202659&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=built+to+last\">Built to Last</a></em> by Jim Collins, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Minute-Manager-Kenneth-Blanchard/dp/0688014291\">The One Minute Manager</a></em> by Ken Blanchard and<em> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436202671&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=seven+habits+of+highly+effective+people\">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a></em> by Stephen Covey.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Art of the Deal</em>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t used in business schools like Michael Porter&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors/dp/0684841487/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436202689&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=competitive+strategy\">Competitive Strategy</a></em>, nor is it a text business executives find useful like Machiavelli&#39;s<em> The Prince</em>, said Lawrence White, a business and economics professor at New York University&#39;s Stern School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for prominent biographies of business executives, Daniel Raff, who teaches at Trump&rsquo;s alma mater of Wharton, listed books about Steve Jobs and by Lee Iacocca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at some of these titles and, for good measure, threw in Dale Carnegie&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1508569754\">How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</a></em>, which promises pathways to attain professional goals (Warren Buffett is a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=NCB3ULgTzhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=snowball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OoyaVarbHcSYgwS34YHoDQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">fan</a>), and Robert Kiyosaki&rsquo;s personal finance guide, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680011/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436204641&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rich+dad+poor+dad\"><em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors and publishers of these popular books offer self-reported estimates; we&rsquo;ve also included the independently compiled Nielsen data.
