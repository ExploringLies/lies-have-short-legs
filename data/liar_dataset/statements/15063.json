Shawn Harrison, R-Tampa, told a reporter that Hogg and another student&nbsp;were &quot;actors&quot; who &quot;travel to various crisis (sic) when they happen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The aide was fired, and the Broward County School District said Hogg and his classmate are &quot;absolutely students at Stoneman Douglas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The genesis of the &lsquo;crisis actor&rsquo; claims</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Conspiracy theorists have latched on to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/video/3710986-confrontation-between-lifeguard-bodysurfer-caught-on-camera-in-redondo-beach-goes-viral/\">CBS news video</a>&nbsp;of Hogg in Los Angeles from 2017 as evidence that the teen might be a plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hogg posted a video that showed an argument between his friend and a lifeguard on Redondo Beach. The argument was unrelated to guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Hogg&rsquo;s friend put a boogie board on a trash can on the beach, a lifeguard asked him to remove it. The friend complied with the lifeguard&#39;s request, but the interaction turned sour after the friend made a snide remark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hogg&rsquo;s video of the dispute went viral. CBS later interviewed Hogg about the dispute and the video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, websites like the conspiracy-minded Infowars reached for straws, including Hogg&rsquo;s appearance after the shooting on CBS <em>This Morning</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Interestingly, Hogg has reconnected with CBS for an appearance on CBS <em>This Morning</em> as the mainstream media unabashedly features high school students as figureheads for a new anti-gun push,&quot; InfoWars wrote in a blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folks on the internet took the claim one step further and claimed that the video was proof that Hogg was just pretending to be a high school student in a different state. At one point, the <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb5p4y/youtube-david-hogg-parkland-shooting-conspiracy-theory\">No. 1 trending video</a> on YouTube was a video suggesting that Hogg was an actor, but the video has since been removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sOZDdYWAGmM9HAL2oe6EM8btp7rEoYj28pqf9BZ4xv1cAeN9xGVgQMuXAVgKJCscpIoWmb0UfHhEpaZirBVygHizTWDF5mtwKAgrZZKWGjL9DhXC-xAEEtKAJ0XLtBB2HgOv4igd\" style=\"border:none; height:291px; width:285px\" /><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wtc1jWOnIiqX7ib_dUuuPgc611Qvnm3RmczZHE1lvgRtgnuVxQk89VRCUwnX4u2XHWGJ56WmcL_ooDOE4aW-q5s0XYnhv5ZhbETmCn98Rs_MDk4tBr_9wqb5Av-O7WcTRoazXX2v\" style=\"border:none; height:353px; width:198px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hogg says he was visiting California, which is corroborated by his personal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/893869667843842048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fheavy.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F02%2Fdavid-hogg-florida-school-shooting-california-video%2F\">Twitter</a> account. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I love going to LA for the summer,&quot; he tweeted August 5, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after, on Aug. 10, 2017, Hogg posted a short vlog (video blog) on YouTube about his experience in California.
