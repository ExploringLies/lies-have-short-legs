She was 6 at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn declined to talk to PolitiFact Georgia about the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she has talked with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and national media about her childhood plenty, even before announcing her candidacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In several AJC stories, including a 1992 Father&rsquo;s Day piece, Nunn says she grew up in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A January, 2014 New York Times story describes her as quipping that she moved &quot;against my will,&quot; when she was 6 and her family relocated to Maryland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same article notes Nunn lived in the Capital region during high school, when she played basketball at the all-girls National Cathedral School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those reports are accurate, said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is the biography listed on her official campaign website, which notes only that she was born near the family&rsquo;s Perry farm, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While the bio that appears on the campaign&#39;s website and is widely utilized by the campaign correctly characterizes Michelle&#39;s biographical facts, a separate document that appeared on some event invitations failed to properly do so,&quot; Click said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the fundraiser was the most high-profile to date in Nunn&rsquo;s race against Republican businessman Perdue, that might be the end of it: a bio not properly vetted before publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But another Nunn misstep, the leak of confidential campaign strategy memos this summer, brings up another point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memos point out that Nunn should anticipate certain attacks, among them that she is &quot;not a &lsquo;real&rsquo; Georgian.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates, and voters, move in and out of the state all the time, so it&rsquo;s unclear how much of a negative that would really be, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue, for instance, has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfqKo1mDoQU\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>television ad </u></a>airing outside of metro Atlanta, that says he &quot;grew up working his family&rsquo;s farm in middle Georgia. &quot; The spot &nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t mention that the 64-year-old spent much of his working life outside the state, in places such as Massachusetts, Tennessee and Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the leaked memos could open up Nunn to attack for being disingenuous, Swint said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Newt Gingrich is from Pennsylvania for heaven&rsquo;s sake,&quot; he said. &quot;Ordinarily it wouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a story, but it is because of the intense publicity from the leak.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leslie Shedd, spokeswoman for the division of the Georgia GOP known as Georgia Victory, said the issue is not where Nunn grew up but why any biography would counter already-published facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To me, it&rsquo;s not an issue that she didn&rsquo;t spend her entire life in Georgia,&quot; Shedd said. &quot;Why does she feel the need to essentially lie about it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the explanation from the Nunn camp, and the ease to find biographical information on her, Swint said it appears the bio was an inadvertent, not intentional mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click described Nunn as a ninth-generation Georgian, who kept ties to Perry by spending holidays and summers at the family farm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn herself, in the New York Times piece, said her father constantly reminded her that she was &quot;from Georgia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn has lived in Atlanta since 1989, after graduating from the University of Virginia at 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Childhood, by any reasonable definition, ends at least at age 18. And the facts are clear: Nunn spent 12 of those years living outside of Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even accounting for summer vacations and holidays, any claim that she spent &quot;most&quot; of her childhood here is inconsistent with the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn&rsquo;s campaign admits it made a mistake with its statement, and there are multiple instances of her acknowledging her move from Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn did spend part of her childhood in Georgia, but certainly not most of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the invitation claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-18T16:00:35.430215", "ruling_date": "2014-09-19T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Nunn invitation exaggerates her youth in Georgia", "ruling_headline_slug": "nunn-invitation-exaggerates-her-youth-georgia", "ruling_link_text": "Nunn moved from Perry at age 6", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Michelle Nunn Fundraising invitation Sept. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Presidency Project, &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25958\">William J.
