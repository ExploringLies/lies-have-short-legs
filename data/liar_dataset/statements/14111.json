But as this year&rsquo;s overtime session wound down, Corcoran touted the overall level of spending the Legislature approved for schools in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richardcorcoran/status/860985149122646016\">May 6, 2017, tweet</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That $24 billion is for all education spending that isn&rsquo;t for colleges and universities, but also includes $419 million in <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/07069\">HB 7069</a>. That 278-page bill was negotiated&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article148982819.html\">behind closed doors</a> in Tallahassee near the end of this year&rsquo;s budgeting process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It covers everything from virtual learning to testing reforms to teacher bonuses. One of the most contested components is $140 million for the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/schools-of-hope-compromise-all-but-finalized----in-secret/2321893\">schools of hope</a>&quot; program, largely to attract privately managed charter schools to compete with near-failing schools in poor neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the heated debate on school funding, we wondered whether the 2017-18 state budget really contained &quot;the greatest investment in education in Florida history,&quot; or if there&rsquo;s more to the balance sheet we should consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A marginal increase in base funding</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a quick overview, the most common measure of education spending is the <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/finance/fl-edu-finance-program-fefp/fl-edu-finance-program-fefp-calculatio.stml\">Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP)</a>, the main source of dollars for K-12 education. When most people discuss K-12 school funding, this is what they are talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By law, it&rsquo;s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the &quot;required local effort,&quot; in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 2017-18, the Legislature increased the base education budget, or FEFP, from about $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the current school year, spending is about $7,196 per pupil. The 2017-18 budget raises that to about $7,221 per student, a 0.34 percent increase. The small change has <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article149190029.html\">drawn jeers from educators and parents</a>, and is $200 less than the <a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/2017-01-31/gov-rick-scott-s-budget-looks-boost-education-spending-cut-taxes-families-business\">$7,421 amount Gov. Rick Scott requested in his proposed budget</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corcoran is talking about more than the FEFP to reach his total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Getting to $24 billion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His $24 billion figure includes several allocations for multiple programs outside the FEFP, and technically is the total for voluntary pre-kindergarten, as well as other programs including mentoring services and grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We requested analyses from both the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, and they came up with roughly the same figures: The <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Media/PressReleases/Show/2722\">entire education budget for the next fiscal year</a> &mdash; including the FEFP, grants, special programs and more &mdash; is about $14.7 billion in state funds (including $3.2 billion from state trust funds), plus another $9 billion from the required local effort. That&rsquo;s a total of $23.7 billion, give or take a few estimated millions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you add <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article149346124.html\">HB 7069&rsquo;s $419 million</a> to that, you get about $24 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said that $24 billion outstripped all education funding from prior years, topping the current fiscal year&rsquo;s $23.4 billion. He sent us a list of 10 years&rsquo; worth of spending, but would not specify what programs his office was counting when they compiled the figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s okay, because we don&rsquo;t need to look at every program. Even with its tiny increase for next year, the FEFP is slated to be the highest it&rsquo;s ever been. It&rsquo;s been on the rise the last few years, after Scott cut education spending when he took office after the 2008 recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Fiscal year</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Total K-12 budget</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Per-pupil spending</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>K-12 enrollment</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2007-08</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.7 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$7,126</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.63 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2008-09</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$17.9 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,846</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.62 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2009-10*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,846</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.63 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010-11*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.2 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,897</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.64 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011-12</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$16.6 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,217</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.67 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012-13</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$17.2 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,376</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.70 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013-14</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.3 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,769</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.705 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2014-15</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.9 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,915</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.74 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2015-16</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$19.7 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$7,105</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.77 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2016-17</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$20.2 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$7,196</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.8 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2017-18</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$20.4 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$7,221</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.83 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: right;\"><em>*Includes federal stimulus money</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now for the caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, one would expect the FEFP to go up a bit each year, because generally the total number of students in Florida schools continues to increase. For 2017-18, the state projects an increase of about 300,000 students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means despite a small funding increase, many school districts will actually see total allocations drop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Florida&rsquo;s per-pupil spending lags far behind the <a href=\"http://neatoday.org/2016/02/01/per-pupil-spending-u-s/\">national average of about $10,700</a> (a total that has been dropping in recent years). And even then, the per-pupil amount is less than $100 more than what it was a decade ago, and certainly has not kept up with inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Per-pupil spending would have to be roughly $8,358 next fiscal year to simply equal the 2007-08 level, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">inflation calculator</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also must note that unlike FEFP money, HB 7069&rsquo;s cash is going to very targeted programs, like scholarships for disabled youth (<a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/schools/school-choice/k-12-scholarship-programs/gardiner/gardiner-faqs.stml\">initiated by former Senate President Andy Gardiner</a>), Best and Brightest scholarships for teachers, and incentives for charter schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That money also isn&rsquo;t guaranteed, because Scott has to sign it first. School officials across the state, from <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article149192189.html\">Miami-Dade</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theledger.com/news/20170509/polk-county-school-district-officials-urge-veto-on-hurtful-state-budget\">Polk County</a> and beyond, have called for Scott to veto the bill because they say it doesn&rsquo;t adequately address their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corcoran tweeted that at $24 billion, the House has made &quot;the greatest investment in education in Florida history!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sheer&nbsp;dollars, that appears to be the case in large part because the Legislature agreed to an incremental bump in funding. Even if Scott doesn&rsquo;t sign HB 7069, which targets very specific programs, the main state-local funding source alone is still at the highest total it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&#39;s not a runaway difference. Compared with the current year, the per-pupil increase is less than one-half of 1 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increases that do exist won&#39;t affect every school district equally, and&nbsp;some counties likely will see less money because of how the state allocates school funds. Corcoran is also including spending&nbsp;that hasn&#39;t yet been approved by the governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim loses even more luster when taking into account that Florida&#39;s education spending, already lower than the national average, hasn&rsquo;t kept up with inflation for years. The next fiscal year&nbsp;is no different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
