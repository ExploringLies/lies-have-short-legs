Here&#39;s what he said in a statement touting the bill, which would extend government funding by another week while also providing funds to the Pentagon for the remainder of the year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As I&rsquo;ve said throughout this process, since the spending binge in Washington is hurting job creation in this country, we&rsquo;re going to fight for the largest cuts possible &ndash; real cuts, not more smoke and mirrors,&quot; Boehner said in the April 5, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.speaker.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=234109\">statement</a>. &quot;We&rsquo;ve made clear that Democrats&rsquo; $33 billion proposal is not enough, and much of it is based on gimmicks. To make a positive impact on our economy, the cuts need to be significant, and they need to be real. Failing to make real cuts will send a signal to job creators that Washington is still not serious about getting government spending under control. &nbsp;...<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;re not going to allow the Senate and White House to force us to choose between two options that are bad for America, whether it&rsquo;s a bad deal that fails to make real spending cuts, or accepting a government shutdown due to Senate inaction. We&rsquo;ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year. We may pass this to keep the government running if Democrats don&rsquo;t listen to the American people and get serious about cutting spending.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt issue is this line: &quot;We&rsquo;ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, while the bill does include $12 billion in cuts, it also includes $7.6 billion in additional spending for the Defense Department -- a 1.5 percent increase over last year&rsquo;s level. (This news release from the House Appropriations Committee breaks down the <a href=\"http://www.appropriations.house.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&amp;PressRelease_id=280\">numbers</a> in the bill.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the net amount of cuts is $4.4 billion -- roughly one-third of the $12 billion figure Boehner cited in his statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending, considers the emphasis on the $12 billion figure misleading.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Saying the continuing resolution cuts $12 billion while ignoring the $7.6 billion in defense adds is like saying you met your weight loss goals if you don&rsquo;t count your backside,&quot; Ellis quipped in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Boehner&rsquo;s office for the speaker&rsquo;s perspective, but we did not hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find that Boehner, who decried budget &quot;gimmicks&quot; in his statement, is conveniently leaving out the spending increase and painting a misleading picture of the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoehner&rsquo;s statement -- &quot;we&rsquo;ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year&quot; -- is carefully worded. The bill does include $12 billion in cuts to discretionary spending, and it does fund the Defense Department, as he indicated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we also think Boehner&rsquo;s artful wording suggests a much larger cut than the bill actually delivers when the additional defense spending is included. Using the net figure for spending reductions would have been a more accurate description. On balance, we rate Boehner&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-07T16:13:36.937572", "ruling_date": "2011-04-07T16:42:39", "ruling_headline": "John Boehner says interim spending bill would cut $12 billion", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-boehner-says-interim-spending-bill-would-cut-", "ruling_link_text": "It has $12 billion in cuts, but also $7.6 billion in added spending", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJohn Boehner, &quot;Speaker Boehner: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re Going to Fight for the Largest Cuts Possible &ndash; Real Cuts, Not More Smoke and Mirrors&rsquo;&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.speaker.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=234109\">news release</a>), April 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse Appropriations Committee, &quot;Another Continuing Resolution Introduced to Prevent Government Shutdown, Cut $12 billion in Spending&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.appropriations.house.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&amp;PressRelease_id=280\">news release</a>), April 4, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, April 7, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "Speaker of the House of Representatives", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 49, "last_name": "Boehner", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-boehner", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnboehner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/49/", "total_count": 69, "true_count": 17, "website": "http://www.speaker.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a public statement", "statement_date": "2011-04-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
