Kearns has called for a federal investigation into the number of deaths at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was shocked to learn of these numbers from the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,&quot; said Kearns, a South Buffalo Democrat. &quot;Seventy-six deaths in three years equate to about 25 patients a year dying at this facility.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns has an intense reason to focus on the Buffalo facility. He opposes a state plan to close the Western New York Children&rsquo;s Psychiatric Center in West Seneca, located in his district, and relocate its patients to the Buffalo Psychiatric Center by the end of 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state has said there will be a separate entrance and wing for children at the Buffalo facility, but opponents of the plan still do not want children relocated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns wants an independent investigation of the Buffalo facility before the consolidation, but the state calls that unnecessary. The state also disputes the number of deaths Kearns has cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, who&rsquo;s right? Did 76 patients die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center over three years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How many died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state requires facilities like the Buffalo Psychiatric Center to report the number of deaths that happened on-site and also certain deaths that happened away from the facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every patient death &mdash; inpatient or outpatient &mdash; must be reported, whether the death is related to&nbsp;treatment or not. If someone receiving outpatient treatment dies in a car crash, for example, that death would be reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facility also must count people who die within 30 days of ending treatment, regardless of the circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns cites 76 deaths because that&rsquo;s the number reported between June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016, on a document from the state Justice Center for the Protection of People With Special Needs. An advocate for children with special needs obtained the document through a Freedom of Information Law request and shared the information with Kearns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Justice Center calls Kearns&rsquo; claim inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would be inaccurate to assume that all 76 deaths listed in this FOIL response to have &nbsp;physically occurred at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,&quot; the Justice Center said in a statement. &nbsp;&quot;The information provided includes a listing of all deaths reported to the Justice Center of individuals receiving residential services at a particular facility or who had received such services within 30 days of their death.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, &quot;please be advised that we do not track where the death occurred, since a death could occur in a location that is not under the jurisdiction of the Justice Center, such as in an emergency room,&quot; the response said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Office of Mental Health, which runs the Buffalo facility, confirmed in an email that 13 people died on-site at the facility in the same time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;During the time frame in question, there were 13 deaths on the Buffalo Psychiatric Center campus, all due to natural causes,&quot; according to a statement from the mental health agency. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 63 other deaths did not happen at the facility and could be unrelated to any treatment. The state did not have a breakdown of how many of the 63 people who died were still patients at the time of their deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns said 76 patients died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center between June 2013 and March 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number is misleading. The state Office of Mental Health confirmed 13 deaths at the facility during that time. The remaining deaths did not happen at the facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-12T15:30:04.915706", "ruling_date": "2017-04-12T16:29:05", "ruling_headline": "76 patients did not die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-many-patients-have-died-buffalo-psychiatric-ce", "ruling_link_text": "Not all 76 died at the facility", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email and phone conversation with Assemblyman Michael P.
