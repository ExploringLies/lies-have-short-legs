He&rsquo;s talking about a legal battle over land rights unfolding in South Africa. There are very few actual statistics that show racially based farm violence. The last time our colleagues Africa Check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-statistics-farm-attacks-murders-sa/\">fact-checked</a> farm murders in 2017, they found 57.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t true that Trump is sending troops to South Africa.
