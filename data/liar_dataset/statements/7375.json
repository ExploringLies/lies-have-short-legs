Marco Rubio criticized Obama&rsquo;s handling of the economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Economic growth is the best way to help the middle class,&quot; Rubio said during the Feb. 12, 2013,response. &quot;Unfortunately, our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that correct?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe located the <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdphighlights.pdf\">announcement</a>&nbsp;from the U.S. Department of Commerce&rsquo;s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal agency that calculates gross domestic product, or GDP -- the benchmark statistic for measuring the size of the economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Jan. 30, 2013, the bureau announced that in the final quarter of 2012, GDP shrunk by 0.1 percent -- a small enough decline to prompt the qualifier &quot;slightly&quot; in the news release&rsquo;s headline, yet notable because it represented the first quarterly decline in GDP since the second quarter of 2009, when the economy was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe fourth-quarter decline was striking because the third quarter had seen GDP growth of 3.1 percent, the third-fastest quarterly expansion since the end of the recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bureau cited several reasons for the decline, most notably a fall in defense spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEconomists said the data was not necessarily a sign that the economy was heading back into recession, and indeed, within a few days, a different federal agency -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- released <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">rosier data on job growth</a>, showing a monthly increase of 157,000 jobs in January, plus upward revisions of two prior months totaling 127,000 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s too early to say whether the fourth-quarter decline in GDP represents a reversal of economic fortune or just a blip, so it&rsquo;s prudent not to place too much weight on one quarter&rsquo;s worth of data. But we have no quarrel with the way Rubio phrased it -- that the economy &quot;actually shrank during the last three months of 2012.&quot; We rate his statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-12T21:04:39.233220", "ruling_date": "2013-02-12T23:08:19", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio says U.S. economy shrank in last quarter of 2012", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-says-us-economy-shrank-last-quarter-20", "ruling_link_text": "It shrank slightly, but it did shrink", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBureau of Economic Analysis, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdphighlights.pdf\">GDP Declines Slightly in Fourth Quarter</a>,&quot; Jan. 30, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">Employment Situation Summary</a>,&quot; Feb. 1, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 36, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Marco", "half_true_count": 33, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 277, "last_name": "Rubio", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "marco-rubio", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Marco_Rubio.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/277/", "total_count": 168, "true_count": 20, "website": "http://www.rubio.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the Republican response to the State of the Union Address", "statement_date": "2013-02-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
