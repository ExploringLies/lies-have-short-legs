A week before the Trump rally, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/21/the-big-hedge-funds-are-betting-big-on-hillary-clinton.html\">it was reported</a> that George Soros and two other hedge fund managers had given a total of $5.5 million to Clinton&rsquo;s campaign or to super PACs supporting her in August 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s a long way from $100 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think you&rsquo;ve heard that figure before, perhaps it was from <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clintons-wall-street-dilemma-1454637448\">a February 2016 report</a> by the Wall Street Journal. It estimated that since Clinton and former President Bill Clinton entered national politics in the early 1990s, Wall Street has contributed more than $100 million to their political campaigns, charitable foundation and personal finances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, that doesn&rsquo;t help Trump&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The campaign figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The go-to source on this is OpenSecrets.org, the website of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center generally considers &quot;Wall Street&quot; and hedge funds to be the securities and investment industry. However, other industries could be added, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t get back to us with evidence to back his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we tried to view his claim broadly. We counted contributions to Clinton&rsquo;s campaign as well as to super PACs that support her. And we counted contributions not only from the securities and investment industry, but also two related industries, as they are categorized by the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/include/contribmethod_pop.php\">To be clear:</a> The contributions don&rsquo;t come from firms.
