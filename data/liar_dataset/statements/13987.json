Facebook users flagged the story for possibly being fake, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the gate, we&rsquo;ll note the story is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said that the United States Treasury paid $411 million for &quot;Royalty Payments for Obamacare&quot; to a limited liability corporation owned by someone named Barry Soetero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The money was for the author of Obamacare for &quot;expenses and royalties associated with naming the bill.&quot; The story said Obama was the bill&rsquo;s author and therefore, he is the one collecting this $411 million. The conspiratorial implication is that Obama actually is Soetoro. (Soetoro is the name of Obama&#39;s stepfather,&nbsp;Lolo Soetoro.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FederalistTribune.com said the money was split among accounts in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Caledonia. That last one is actually the name the Roman Empire gave to the region that is now Scotland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among other claims in the disjointed post is a citation for <a href=\"http://freedomsfinalstand.com/obama-tax-audit-turns-millions-offshore-accounts-stolen-taxpayers/\">an April 4 missive</a> on FreedomsFinalStand.com, which said Obama had denied using the Soetoro alias many times. FreedomsFinalStand.com said that these contrived royalty payments were stopped after Obamacare was renamed the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a patently absurd assertion about the law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and was later dubbed Obamacare by skeptical Republicans to taunt Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s go back even farther: It appears this post first breached the Internet as <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-obama-tax-audit-turns-up-millions-in-offshore-accounts-stolen-from-taxpayers/\">a March 11 post</a> on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site we know was designed to troll conservatives with faux news made up to stoke ire on political issues.
