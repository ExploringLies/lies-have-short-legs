But according to the Macomb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, the article is &quot;completely FAKE NEWS.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Published Sept. 30 on nbc9news.com&mdash;a website that features an &quot;NBC 9 News&quot; banner&mdash; the article is headlined, &quot;Macomb County Fears &lsquo;Vigilante&rsquo; Serial Killer After Third Pedophile Found Murdered in 1 Week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, what Macomb County residents actually feared was that this story was real: The Macomb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office announced on Facebook that several people reached out to ask the agency about the story after it appeared in their News Feeds. On Oct. 1, the sheriff&rsquo;s office posted a message refuting the allegations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Macomb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has not had any recent murders involving any registered sex offenders and our residents have no reason to be fearful of a killer on the loose,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/macombcountysheriffsoffice/photos/a.290921547632451/1995591550498767/?type=3&amp;theater\">the agency&rsquo;s statement reads</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three days earlier, on Sept. 28, <a href=\"http://cbs15.com/longview-tx-authorities-fear-vigilante-serial-killer-after-third-pedophile-found-dead-in-a-week/\">a nearly identical story</a> about a serial killer appeared on a website called cbs15.com. &quot;Longview, TX Authorities Fear &lsquo;Vigilante&rsquo; Serial Killer After Third Pedophile Found Dead In A Week,&quot; the headline reads. As in Michigan, the supposed first victim in Longview was &quot;a 52-year-old man charged with sex offences [sic] against children as young as 5.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Longview Police Department also derided the article as &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no truth or validity that our sources can find that the author or the supposed news affiliate exists,&quot; reads a statement that the department <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LongviewPolice/photos/a.183063081762587/1845089762226569/?type=3&amp;theater\">posted on its own Facebook</a> page on Sept. 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clicking on the byline for both stories leads to contact pages for the purported news sites. &nbsp;&quot;We&rsquo;d love to hear from you,&quot; the pages read, &quot;please use the form below for any general enquiries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Messages sent to both the NBC 9 News and the CBS 15 News websites were not answered. Reached by phone, Eric Ehrler, a detective sergeant with the Macomb County sheriff&#39;s office, said the story is false. &quot;Don&#39;t know where it came from, and there&#39;s no information that it is accurate at all,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NBC News affiliate in Detroit, <a href=\"https://www.clickondetroit.com/\">WDIV Local 4</a>, responded to the false headline by writing its own story on the hoax: &quot;There are several NBC affiliates throughout the country that broadcast on a virtual channel 9,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/this-is-what-fake-news-looks-like-website-claims-vigilante-pedophile-killer-wanted-in-macomb-county\">writes Brian Newland in an article on WDIV&rsquo;s website</a>, &quot;but none of them appear to be associated with nbc9news.com.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-16T11:33:09.927752", "ruling_date": "2018-10-16T11:28:05", "ruling_headline": "No, pedophiles outside of Detroit are not being targeted by a serial killer", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-pedophiles-outside-detroit-are-not-being-target", "ruling_link_text": "False Story of Retribution", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://nbc9news.com/macomb-county-fears-vigilante-serial-killer-after-third-pedophile-murdered-in-1-week/\">&quot;Macomb County Fears &lsquo;Vigilante&rsquo; Serial Killer After Third Pedophile Murdered In 1 Week,&quot;</a>&nbsp;Sept. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/macombcountysheriffsoffice/photos/a.290921547632451/1995591550498767/?type=3&amp;theater\">Macomb County Sheriff&#39;s Office Facebook post</a>, Oct. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://cbs15.com/longview-tx-authorities-fear-vigilante-serial-killer-after-third-pedophile-found-dead-in-a-week/\">&quot;Longview, TX Authorities Fear &lsquo;Vigilante&rsquo; Serial Killer After Third Pedophile Found Dead In A Week,&quot;</a> Sept. 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LongviewPolice/photos/a.183063081762587/1845089762226569/?type=3&amp;theater\">Longview Police Department Facebook post,</a> Sept. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WDIV Local 4 story, <a href=\"https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/this-is-what-fake-news-looks-like-website-claims-vigilante-pedophile-killer-wanted-in-macomb-county\">&#39;This is what fake news looks like: Website claims vigilante pedophile killer wanted in Macomb County,&#39;</a> Oct. 1, 2019&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p><strong>Says Detroit-area&nbsp;law enforcement is searching for a &#39;vigilante&#39; serial killer after three pedophiles were killed in one week</strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a post on Facebook", "statement_date": "2018-09-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
