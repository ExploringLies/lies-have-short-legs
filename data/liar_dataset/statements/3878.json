Gov. Kim Guadagno. On WNYC, Guadagno touted the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant, or BRRAG, program as the initiative that kept Panasonic in New Jersey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNear the beginning of a more than 20-minute interview, WNYC host Brian Lehrer asked Guadagno specifically about the BRRAG program, which was <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552011/approved/20110107c.html\">revised in January</a> to increase the amount of tax credits companies can receive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I read that, as we go down some of your initiatives, that one of your programs is to beef up the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant program so that it&#39;s $2,250 annually for six years for every job retained in New Jersey, compared to $1,500 for just one year in the past. Do I have the numbers right and is that an important change?&quot; Lehrer asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGuadagno said &quot;it&rsquo;s a crucial change&quot; and confirmed the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s a very lucrative program. We&#39;re winning that game based on the program,&quot; she said. &quot;For example, I think you&#39;ve probably read, Panasonic is staying in New Jersey based on that program and some other incentives.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGuadagno then talked about other companies that are choosing to stay in New Jersey. Lehrer shifted the conversation back to Panasonic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I know Mayor (Cory) Booker called that a game-changer for the City of Newark the other day. But on the retention, how much do you think those dollar figures matter? Because some people question whether a per job ... payment program just makes businesses that don&#39;t plan to leave threaten to leave and we&#39;ve seen in other states that they&#39;re not binding anyway. So then some businesses abolish some jobs in a few months or even a few years and then they get paid for pretending to retain others. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen those kind of things go on. So how do you cost it out in a way you know you are not going to get scammed?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGuadagno answered: &quot;Well, there&#39;s a couple of issues there. First of all, let&#39;s stick with Panasonic for just a minute. Panasonic is a multi-national company who was leaving New Jersey, certified in their records that they were out the door ... It&#39;s not a surprise that they could go anywhere in the world. So we went to them and said, &lsquo;Stay in New Jersey; use these incentive programs.&rsquo; So, we were able to keep Panasonic solely because of the existence of this incentive program.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReally? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check, and found Guadagno was wrong to brag about BRRAG.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We did not apply for that grant,&quot; said Peter Fannon, vice president of technology policy at Panasonic. But, he said, &nbsp;&quot;with the help of the transit credit we were able to stay in New Jersey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPanasonic <a href=\"http://www.njeda.com/web/pdf/eda/February162011BoardAgenda.pdf\">applied</a> for a $102.4 million Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit. If the company doesn&rsquo;t create an additional 200 jobs at the Newark site during the next 10 years, it will qualify for 80 percent of the tax credit, or $81.9 million, according to a state Economic Development Authority memo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe EDA, which administers tax credit programs, <a href=\"http://www.njeda.com/web/pdf/eda/m_021611.pdf\">approved</a> Panasonic&rsquo;s application on Feb. 16.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaura Jones, spokeswoman for the state agency, said companies that receive Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits aren&rsquo;t eligible to get BRRAGs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You can&rsquo;t get both a hub and a BRRAG,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey went back to Guadagno&rsquo;s staff with the conflicting information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe lieutenant governor&rsquo;s spokesman, Fred Snowflack, said Guadagno wasn&rsquo;t trying to deliberately mislead listeners during the radio interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You can understand the overall point that she was trying to make: that it was from incentives from the state that kept Panasonic in New Jersey,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGuadagno claimed BRRAG helped Panasonic stay in New Jersey. Panasonic said BRRAG wasn&rsquo;t a factor in the company&rsquo;s decision and the state EDA confirmed Panasonic is not eligible for any tax credits through that program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, join the conversation at <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/politifact_new_jersey_lt_gov_k.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-07T12:58:12.105926", "ruling_date": "2011-06-10T05:03:00", "ruling_headline": "Lt.
