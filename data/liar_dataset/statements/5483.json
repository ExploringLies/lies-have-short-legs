Or for its place in civil rights history. Or for the fact that an alarming number of its road names include the word &quot;peachtree.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow a local water official thinks the metro area deserves another claim to fame: leader in water conservation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPat Stevens is chief of the Environmental Planning Division of the Atlanta Regional Commission, which staffs the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District. This district manages the region&rsquo;s water supply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStevens told a group of business leaders that the planning district is outpacing even California, which has earned national attention for its water conservation efforts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District is now the national leader in conservation,&quot; Stevens told the crowd, according to a Jan. 24 story on AccessNorthGa.com.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have out-California&#39;ed California,&quot; Stevens said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were curious. Since when was this region a leader in water conservation?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWater is a precious commodity in Georgia, so much so that the state has been battling Alabama and Florida in federal court for water rights for decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s water supply is uncertain, and in 2001, state legislators created the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District to develop the region&rsquo;s water policy and coordinate its implementation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called up Stevens, who told PolitiFact Georgia that she typically says that the planning district is &quot;a&quot; national leader in conservation, not &quot;the&quot; national leader, but she doesn&rsquo;t dispute the accuracy of the news story. We evaluated her quote as published.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also sought out top experts in water conservation for their assessments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey acknowledged that the Atlanta region has made improvements in its water planning, but all thought that calling the area &quot;the&quot; national leader, or even &quot;a&quot; national leader, goes too far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;None of that is true,&quot; said Mary Ann Dickinson, executive director for the Alliance for Water Efficiency, a national water conservation group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that metro Atlanta is the leader in conservation efficiency by any means,&quot; said Jenny Hoffner, the director of the water supply program for American Rivers, a national group that advocates for clean water and conservation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;On its face, it&rsquo;s a silly claim. But that&rsquo;s not to say that Atlanta hasn&rsquo;t made some great strides,&quot; said Charles Fishman, a journalist who specializes in water issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStevens cited several specifics to defend her statement. We&rsquo;ll address the major ones here. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t* <strong>Nowhere else in the country have so many local governments come together to do this kind of work over such a short period of time</strong>: The metro water district covers 15 counties from Hall to Coweta counties, an area that includes more than 90 cities and dozens of water systems. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tIt was founded in 2001, decades after similar organizations in places such as Southern California and Las Vegas were founded. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThe North Georgia district is relatively young. But at least one larger area -- California -- is implementing specific water conservation goals. A 2009 law requires the state to reduce urban per-capita water use 20 percent by 2020. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAs of 2009, the local district&rsquo;s plans were less ambitious. Water planners expect a 13 percent reduction in water use by 2035 if water systems follow district rules. The district has since made changes to its rules that are not accounted for in this prediction. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<strong>* Declines in per-capita water use</strong>: According to metro water district numbers, per-capita water use has declined from 149 gallons per day in 2000 to 110 gallons in 2010.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tCritics said that outside factors such as the economy might play a role in this reduction Utility use typically declines during a downturn.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<strong>* Following North Georgia water district conservation rules is mandatory</strong>: The 2001 state statute establishing the water district requires members to follow the district&rsquo;s rules or face permit revocation.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tNo permit has been revoked for water conservation problems, a Georgia Environmental Protection Division spokesman said.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tCalifornia also sanctions water suppliers who fail to comply with its water conservation statute. They are not eligible for state water grants or loans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts gave PolitiFact Georgia other rebuttals to the metro district&rsquo;s claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDickinson noted that the district does not fund conservation efforts such as low-flow toilet replacement rebates. That&rsquo;s the responsibility of local governments and water services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy way of contrast, Dickinson cited the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. This water district has budgeted $19.1 million this fiscal year to fund business and consumer rebates on things such as more efficient toilets, sprinklers, washing machines, and for pulling out water-thirsty turf, according to its spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll the experts we interviewed noted that the North Georgia district has not set specific, mandatory water use reduction goals as California has done.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey also listed programs they think are innovative and more effective at reducing water use. They included a law in Orlando that requires developers to install reclaimed water lines to new subdivisions. In San Antonio, nonprofit businesses can get low-flow toilets for free, including installation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District certainly deserves credit where credit is due. Per-capita water use is down (though the cause is disputed) and current rules do aim to conserve water.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we found no consensus that the region has a reputation as a national leader in water conservation, much less as &quot;the&quot; national leader.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven what we found, a stronger claim is that the region is playing catch-up. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District was formed decades after similar organizations elsewhere, and it doesn&rsquo;t fund conservation efforts that other areas have.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Stevens&rsquo; statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, her statement meets PolitiFact&rsquo;s definition of Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-05T18:14:08.731131", "ruling_date": "2012-03-06T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Claim: Atlanta area is national leader in water conservation", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-atlanta-area-national-leader-water-conservat", "ruling_link_text": "We're playing catch-up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAccessNorthGa.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=245217\">ARC provides Lanier update</a>,&quot; Jan. 24, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.northgeorgiawater.com/files/MNGWPD_Act.pdf\">Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District Act</a>, updated 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMetropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, Water Supply and Water Conservation Management Plan, <a href=\"http://www.northgeorgiawater.com/files/Sec4_ConservationAnalysis_WSWC_May2009.pdf\">Water Conservation Analysis</a>, May 2009</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeorgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, <a href=\"http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/Water/sb370.pdf\">Georgia Water Stewardship Act of 2010</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalifornia Department of Water Resources, <a href=\"http://www.water.ca.gov/wateruseefficiency/sb7/docs/SB7-7-TheLaw.pdf\">Senate Bill No. 7</a>, Nov. 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSan Antonio Water District, <a href=\"http://www.saws.org/conservation/commercial/toilets/\">commercial toilet retrofit program</a>, accessed Feb. 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrlando Sentinel, &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-05-06/news/0205060219_1_reclaimed-water-reclaimed-water-lines-water-supply\">Lawns To Drink Recycled Water</a>,&quot; May 6, 2002<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Jenny Hoffner, director, Water Supply Program, American Rivers, Jan. 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Sally Bethea, director, Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, Jan. 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Mary Ann Dickinson, executive director, Alliance for Water Efficiency, Feb. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Charles Fishman, author, &quot;The Big Thirst,&quot; Feb. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Pat Stevens, chief, Environmental Planning Division, Atlanta Regional Commission, Feb. 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Bob Muir, spokesman, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Feb. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Kevin Chambers, spokesman, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, Feb. 6, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Director of Environmental Planning, Atlanta Regional Commission", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Pat", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 1717, "last_name": "Stevens", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "pat-stevens", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouettes_17.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1717/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe Atlanta area&rsquo;s water planning district &quot;is now the national leader in conservation.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news article", "statement_date": "2012-01-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
