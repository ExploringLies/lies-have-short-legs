John McCain has picked up his attacks on the Affordable Care Act recently, making the law synonymous with his Democratic rival, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IE48mGZbsUo\">May 17 attack ad</a> from McCain against Kirkpatrick, <a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/state/anne-kirkpatrick-to-challenge-john-mccain-for-us-senate\">who&rsquo;s running</a> for McCain&rsquo;s Senate seat, is a case in point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the claim that the healthcare law is her &quot;proudest&quot; vote, the ad&rsquo;s on-screen text states, &quot;30,000 Arizonans may have no choice&quot; for healthcare coverage, citing the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/19/investing/unitedhealthcare-obamacare-exchanges-aca/\">departure of UnitedHealthCare</a>, the nation&rsquo;s largest insurer, from the state&rsquo;s marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s devastating, especially to rural counties,&quot; the ad&rsquo;s narrator points out. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While folks who have United will be insured through Dec. 31, 2016, we wondered whether thousands of Arizonans really won&rsquo;t have a health care coverage choice come 2017. &nbsp;(No coverage results in a <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/\">penalty</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>United announced <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/19/investing/unitedhealthcare-obamacare-exchanges-aca/\">in April</a> that it would stop Affordable Care Act coverage in Arizona - and most of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/19/unitedhealth-group-to-exit-obamacare-exchanges-in-all-but-a-handful-of-states/\">34 states</a> it has plans in - by year&rsquo;s end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 11 was the deadline for health insurers to submit their 2017 Affordable Care Act state coverage plans to the federal government, which runs HealthCare.gov. In eight rural Arizona counties - Cochise, Graham, Greenlee, La Paz, Pinal, Santa Cruz, Yavapai and Yuma - only one health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, signed up to cover individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, only United and Blue Cross offer health insurance plans across all eight counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many insured people in these counties stand to be affected in 2017? Those are the people who will only get to choose Blue Cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>People insured may vary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero pointed us to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/plan-selections-zip-code-and-county-health-insurance-marketplace-march-2016\">data</a> for insured people in those eight counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the data, 30,761 people across all eight counties bought coverage through the exchange as of Feb. 1, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Allen Gjersvig, director of Enrollment Services at Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers,&nbsp;a umbrella group for healthcare organizations that help people sign up for coverage, said the numbers do not specifically note how many people have either United or Blue Cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a snapshot, we don&rsquo;t know what plan they chose,&quot; Gjersvig said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Blue Cross Blue Shield specifically how many people currently have health insurance plans - and what plans they expect to offer in 2017 - in those eight counties, but they declined to provide those details, citing the &quot;competitive landscape.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are counties and consumers that will, as it stands right now, see only one insurance company,&quot; Gjersvig said. &quot;Blue Cross has filed rates for all counties in Arizona.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that health insurance coverage options in rural areas are limited overall. Insurers note that people in rural areas <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/insurance-options-dwindle-in-some-rural-regions-1463356031\">tend to be sicker</a> and rack up more health care costs. But rural areas also have <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rural-idUSTRE76Q0MJ20110727\">fewer physicians</a> than urban areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCain&rsquo;s campaign ad said, &quot;30,000 Arizonans may have no choice&quot; for Affordable Care Act coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 30,000 number is just a snapshot of how many people have bought coverage through the exchange in those eight Arizona counties. That could change, plus it&#39;s based on months old data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, the ad&rsquo;s claim is largely correct. In 2017, Blue Cross Blue Shield stands to be the lone health insurer for Arizonans seeking health insurance in those counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the ad&rsquo;s claim as Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-09T14:25:51.641306", "ruling_date": "2016-06-10T20:00:00", "ruling_headline": "John McCain ad claims some Arizonans may have no healthcare choice ", "ruling_headline_slug": "mccain-ad-claims-arizonans-affordable-care-act", "ruling_link_text": "Number could change, but correct", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact TV Ad Archive, &quot;<a href=\"http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_annkirkpatrick_johnmccain_do69a/\">Ann Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s proudest moment</a>,&quot; accessed June 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN Money, &quot;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/19/investing/unitedhealthcare-obamacare-exchanges-aca/\">UnitedHealthCare to exit most Obamacare exchanges</a>,&quot; April 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, &quot;<a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/plan-selections-zip-code-and-county-health-insurance-marketplace-march-2016\">Plan selections by zip code and county in the health insurance marketplace: March 2016</a>,&quot; accessed June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/insurance-options-dwindle-in-some-rural-regions-1463356031\">Insurance options dwindle in some rural regions</a>,&quot; May 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/19/unitedhealth-group-to-exit-obamacare-exchanges-in-all-but-a-handful-of-states/\">UnitedHealth Group to exit Obamacare exchanges in all but a &lsquo;handful&rsquo; of states</a>,&quot; April 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC15, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/state/anne-kirkpatrick-to-challenge-john-mccain-for-us-senate\">Ann Kirkpatrick to challenge John McCain for U.S. Senate</a>,&quot; May 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HealthCare.gov, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/\">The fee for not having health insurance</a>,&quot; accessed June 8, 2016 &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rural-idUSTRE76Q0MJ20110727\">Rural Americans face greater lack of healthcare access</a>,&quot; July 27, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizona Department of Insurance, &quot;<a href=\"http://media2.abc15.com/html/images/embeds/QHP on Marketplace.jpg\">Marketplace Qualified Health Plans</a>,&quot; May 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero, May 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers Director of Enrollment Services Allen Gjersvig, June 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Blue Cross Blue Shield Arizona spokeswoman Kendra Schmitt, June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Georgetown University Senior Research Professor Sabrina Corlette, June 9, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 32, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 39, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 31, "home_state": "Arizona", "id": 8, "last_name": "McCain", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "john-mccain", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnmccain.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Arizona", "edition": "Arizona", "edition_slug": "arizona", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 56, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Arizona Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/56/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/8/", "total_count": 190, "true_count": 37, "website": "http://www.johnmccain.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;30,000 Arizonans may have no choice&quot; on Affordable Care Act coverage.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign advertisement", "statement_date": "2016-05-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
