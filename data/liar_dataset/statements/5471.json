Here, we&#39;re examining if the district &quot;opened 22 new schools over six years to keep pace with growth in student population and implement the class size amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe school district&rsquo;s own website contradicts Fiorentino on this one. It lists just 20 new schools as having opened from 2005 through 2011. Fiorentino said Friday that the press release contained a typo and agreed that the correct number is 20.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis building boom did take place to help the district deal with rapidly increasing enrollment. The district&rsquo;s student body grew from 59,474 at the end of the 2004-05 school year to 66,696 by the end of 2010-11. And, for a time, the new schools did help reduce class sizes district-wide.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut when it came time to implement the class size amendment in 2011-12, even with enrollment changed only slightly, the district did not meet the 2002 voter requirement for smaller classes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe state imposed a $4 million penalty against Pasco for its failure to comply, the fourth-highest fine among the 35 districts that did not meet the rule. Fiorentino and the School Board have since submitted a plan to the state Department of Education for meeting the amendment in 2012, which could reduce the punishment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the district did open many new schools to cope with growth and class size, it didn&rsquo;t open the same number Fiorentino said and it didn&rsquo;t meet class size rules every year. We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-02T16:01:27.548980", "ruling_date": "2012-03-04T12:43:40", "ruling_headline": "Is the Pasco County school district keeping up with class size requirements?", "ruling_headline_slug": "pasco-county-school-district-keeping-class-size-re", "ruling_link_text": "Paying fines for missing class size requirements", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Tampa Bay Times</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/k12/statements-by-pasco-superintendent-fiorentino-touting-her-record-are/1218289\">Statements by Pasco superintendent Fiorentino touting her record are mostly on the mark, March 4</a>, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Committee to re-elect Superintendent Heather Fiorentino,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/322241-fiorentino-press-releasepdf.html\">press release</a>, Jan. 6, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/ClassSize/pdf/10-11CsRcA1.pdf\">2010-11 Class Size Reduction</a>, accessed March 2, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlorida State Board of Education, <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/board/meetings/2012_01_24/class.pdf\">Class Size Calculation for 2011-2012</a>,&nbsp;accessed March 2, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPasco County Schools, <a href=\"http://www.pasco.k12.fl.us/construction/new/past\">Schools Opened</a>, accessed March 2, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "superintendent of Pasco County's public schools", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Heather", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 1713, "last_name": "Fiorentino", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "heather-fiorentino", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Fiorentino.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1713/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.heatherfiorentino.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tPasco County &quot;opened 22 new schools over six years to keep pace with growth in student population and implement the class size amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press release", "statement_date": "2012-03-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
