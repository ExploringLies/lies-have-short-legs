Steve Kagen, D-Wis., the NRCC said the stimulus cost Wisconsin &quot;77,000 jobs lost.&quot; We rated that one <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/republicans-say-stimulus-bill-supported-us-rep-ste/\">Pants on Fire</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the attacks have continued.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a July 5, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.nrcc.org/default.asp?id=274&amp;newsid=3000\">news release</a>, the committee singled out U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ron-kind/\">Ron Kind</a>, D-Wis., saying &quot;Kind&rsquo;s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough the stimulus wasn&rsquo;t his plan, Kind <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/38582347.html\">voted for it</a>. Eleven House Democrats and all House Republicans voted against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we noted in our NRCC item about Kagen, critics say the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12185/05-25-ARRA.pdf\">$830 billion </a><a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12185/05-25-ARRA.pdf\">cost</a> of the stimulus has bought too few jobs, and unemployment has grown generally worse since Obama signed the measure into law in February 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the claim that the stimulus spent $278,000 for every job it created is striking.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur colleagues at <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/\">PolitiFact </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/\">PolitiFact </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/\">Texas</a> already have examined it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio found that the statistic originated in a <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-s-economists-stimulus-has-cost-278000-job_576014.html\">blog </a><a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-s-economists-stimulus-has-cost-278000-job_576014.html\">posting</a> on the website of <em>The Weekly Standard</em>, a conservative magazine. The posting by Jeffrey H. Anderson attributes the $278,000-per-job cost to &quot;Obama&rsquo;s economists.&quot; But to come up with that amount, Anderson did his own math with figures from a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/cea_7th_arra_report.pdf\">status </a><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/cea_7th_arra_report.pdf\">report</a> on the stimulus by Obama&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCiting the report, Anderson said the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.4 million jobs at a cost to date of $666 billion. He divided the $666 billion by 2.4 million jobs to come up with a rounded-up figure of $278,000 &nbsp;per job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how our colleagues sized up two reiterations of the claim:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>House Speaker John Boehner</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio weighed in after <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/john-boehner/\">Boehner</a>, an Ohio Republican, tweeted about the blog post. Our colleagues rated Boehner&rsquo;s echoing of the $278,000 cost as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jul/15/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-obamas-economists-/\">False</a>, pointing out that it lumps all of the various types of stimulus spending together.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStimulus spending, as the Associated Press noted in a <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010183560_apusfactcheckstimulusmath.html\">fact </a><a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010183560_apusfactcheckstimulusmath.html\">check</a> of a similar GOP claim, pays not only for the worker but for material, supplies and that worker&#39;s output -- a portion of a road paved, for example.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/david-dewhurst/\">Dewhurst</a>, a Republican, also tweeted about the blog posting. PolitiFact Texas found that of the $666 billion stimulus spending to date, 43 percent was spent on tax cuts for individuals and businesses; 19 percent went to state governments, primarily for education and Medicaid; 13 percent paid for government benefits to individuals such as unemployment and food stamps; and the remaining roughly 24 percent was spent on projects such as infrastructure improvement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat underscores how stimulus money was spent on many things in addition to creating jobs. Our Texas colleagues rated Dewhurst&rsquo;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/jul/20/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-presidents-economists-say-stim/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s two False ratings on the same claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the NRCC if it had any evidence beyond the blog post cited by Boehner and Dewhurst to back up its version of the statement -- that &quot;Kind&rsquo;s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job.&quot; Spokeswoman Andrea Bozek cited various reports critical of the stimulus, but nothing to establish that the $278,000 figure is correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo review:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Republican Congressional Committee, like Boehner and Dewhurst, claimed that the federal stimulus cost $278,000 per job. The NRCC called it &quot;Kind&rsquo;s stimulus&quot; because U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., voted for it. Our PolitiFact colleagues have twice ruled the claim False and the NRCC offered us no new evidence to consider.
