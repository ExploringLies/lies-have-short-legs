I mean, imagine if nurses had to go buy their own syringes. #ugh,&quot; Fischer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennafischer/status/944609878349246464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2017%2F12%2F26%2Foffices-jenna-fischer-blasted-over-incorrect-gop-tax-bill-tweet.html\">tweeted</a> on Dec. 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweet attracted 66,000 retweets and 223,000 likes. (Fischer has about 750,000 followers.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the tweet was wrong, relying on an outdated proposal. (After this fact-check was posted, Fischer deleted the tweet; see &quot;After the Fact&quot; below.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An existing <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc450/tc458\">provision</a> in the tax code has allowed teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250. The provision was <a href=\"http://educationvotes.nea.org/2016/01/06/educator-tax-deduction-expanded-and-made-permanent/\">expanded and made permanent</a> in December 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax bill unveiled by House Republicans in November <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/11/taxes_school_choice_trump_GOP_biggest_education_shift.html\">would have scrapped the deduction</a>. But amid an outcry from teachers and their allies -- we wrote about opposition from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/07/dianne-feinstein/closer-look-classroom-expenses-deduction-teachers-/\">here</a> -- it was <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/teacherbeat/2017/12/250_teacher_tax_deduction_here_to_stay_final_GOP_bill.html\">stripped</a> before the House and Senate passed identical versions of the bill and President Trump signed it on Dec. 22. (The Senate bill actually would have doubled the deduction, but that idea was rejected too.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of Twitter users pointed this out, including one identified as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdrossetto\">Matt Rossetto</a>, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdrossetto/status/944772784739061761\">snarked</a> later that day that Fischer&rsquo;s tweet &quot;is 100% wrong, because the final bill KEPT this deduction, but 14,000 RT&rsquo;s later...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fischer noticed Rossetto&rsquo;s tweet and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennafischer/status/944774066522558464\">fired back</a>, &quot;It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn&#39;t have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Some Twitter users, however, still found fault with Fischer, since $250 was always the limit for that particular deduction -- it was not lowered due to the new law. Rossetto, for instance, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdrossetto/status/944775924901228544\">tweeted back</a>, &quot;It WAS $250 before the bill and hasn&rsquo;t changed. If you&rsquo;re going to grandstand, get it right.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, on Christmas Day, Fischer returned to Twitter to acknowledge her critics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennafischer/status/945369924674863104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2017%2F12%2F26%2Foffices-jenna-fischer-blasted-over-incorrect-gop-tax-bill-tweet.html\">tweeted</a>, &quot;Thanks for your tweets! I had some facts wrong. Teachers surveyed by Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 on school supplies for students. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. The tax deduction was capped at $250.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Fischer didn&rsquo;t explicitly acknowledge that the $250 limit existed before the Republican-backed bill, but she was right on the other statistics. They <a href=\"http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/new-survey-teachers-principals-explores-barriers-equity-education-and-resources-needed\">refer to</a> a <a href=\"https://www.scholastic.com/teacherprincipalreport/funding-priorities.htm\">national survey</a> of 4,721 public school educators for Scholastic by the firm YouGov in July and August 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of the time this article was published, however, Fischer&rsquo;s initial correction tweet had garnered far less interest than her original one -- 830 retweets and about 6,600 likes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fischer tweeted that after enactment of the Republican tax bill, &quot;school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As numerous Twitter users pointed out, that is incorrect -- the newly signed tax bill does not affect the existing deduction for teacher expenses. Fischer later acknowledged that &quot;I had some facts wrong&quot; and deleted the tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her initial tweet False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-27T14:46:01.193797", "ruling_date": "2017-12-27T14:54:41", "ruling_headline": "Jenna Fischer of 'The Office' tweets outdated info on teacher tax deduction", "ruling_headline_slug": "jenna-fischer-office-tweets-outdated-info-teacher-", "ruling_link_text": "Updated to include her correcting tweet", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jenna Fischer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennafischer/status/944609878349246464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2017%2F12%2F26%2Foffices-jenna-fischer-blasted-over-incorrect-gop-tax-bill-tweet.html\">tweet</a>, Dec. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt Rossetto, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdrossetto/status/944772784739061761\">tweet</a>, Dec. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenna Fischer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennafischer/status/944774066522558464\">tweet</a>, Dec. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt Rossetto, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdrossetto/status/944775924901228544\">tweet</a>, Dec. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenna Fischer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennafischer/status/945369924674863104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2017%2F12%2F26%2Foffices-jenna-fischer-blasted-over-incorrect-gop-tax-bill-tweet.html\">tweet</a>, Dec. 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal Revenue Service, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc450/tc458\">Topic Number: 458 - Educator Expense Deduction</a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Education Week,</em> &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/teacherbeat/2017/12/250_teacher_tax_deduction_here_to_stay_final_GOP_bill.html\">$250 Teacher Tax Deduction Here to Stay in Final GOP Bill</a>,&quot; Dec. 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/07/dianne-feinstein/closer-look-classroom-expenses-deduction-teachers-/\">A closer look at the classroom-expenses deduction for teachers: How big is it?</a>&quot; Nov. 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholastic, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.scholastic.com/teacherprincipalreport/funding-priorities.htm\">Teacher and Principal School Report</a>,&quot; 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholastic, &quot;<a href=\"http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/new-survey-teachers-principals-explores-barriers-equity-education-and-resources-needed\">New Survey of Teachers and Principals Explores Barriers to Equity in Education and the Resources Needed to Support Students</a>,&quot; Nov. 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, &quot;&#39;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/12/26/offices-jenna-fischer-blasted-over-incorrect-gop-tax-bill-tweet.html\">The Office&#39;s&#39; Jenna Fischer blasted over incorrect GOP tax bill tweet</a>,&quot; Dec. 26, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Actor", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Jenna", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "California", "id": 4152, "last_name": "Fischer", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "jenna-fischer", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jenna_Fischer_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4152/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278979/"}, "statement": "<p>After enactment of the Republican tax bill, &quot;school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2017-12-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Jenna Fischer of 'The Office' tweets outdated info on teacher tax deduction"}
