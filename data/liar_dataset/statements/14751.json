Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, claimed the House Republican tax reform bill could slash middle-class incomes as much as 9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state taxpayers would lose money if Congress decides to end the federal deduction of state and local taxes, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000,&quot; Higgins <a href=\"https://higgins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/higgins-says-gop-tax-bill-is-a-major-liability-to-every-taxpaying\">said</a> at a hearing. &quot;If you make $50,000 a year, you lose $4,500.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 3.3 million people in New York state take advantage of the state and local tax deduction, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/state-and-local-tax-deduction-state-and-agi\">according to</a> the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax policy and research organization. More than half of those who take the deduction make $100,000 a year or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Higgins right that those taxpayers could lose as much as $9,000?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Explaining the SALT deduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current tax code allows taxpayers to deduct their state and local taxes from their federal taxes. About one-third of filers do this in New York state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That helps residents in states like New York where property taxes are higher. Filers can also deduct either their state income tax or sales tax, but not both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House Republican tax plan would cap the maximum property tax deduction at $10,000 and end the deduction for state income and sales tax altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About two-thirds of filers choose instead to take the standard deduction, a fixed amount set each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where&rsquo;s the number from?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Higgins said is different from what he meant to say, said Theresa Kennedy, the congressman&rsquo;s spokeswoman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He meant to say filers would no longer be able to deduct $9,000 -- not lose $9,000 outright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Higgins&nbsp;supports that claim with data from the Government Finance Officers Association.&nbsp;The group said the average state and local tax deduction in New York state is equal to 9 percent of a filer&#39;s income.&nbsp;That&#39;s where Higgins get the $9,000 figure from. Nine percent of $100,000 is $9,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s in the ballpark. People making between $75,000 and $100,000 deduct $9,949 on average in state and local taxes, according to data from the Tax Policy Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How much they&#39;ll actually save depends on the tax rate,&quot; said Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Couples making $100,000 are currently taxed at 25 percent. That wouldn&rsquo;t change under the Republican plan. A $9,000 tax deduction could save that couple $2,250 in tax, according to <a href=\"https://www.irs.com/articles/tax-credits-vs-tax-deductions\">the IRS</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One caveat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if Higgins had said deduction in his statement, he would still be wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Higgins made his claim after House Republicans decided to keep the deduction for property taxes. The deduction would be capped at $10,000. If someone&rsquo;s property tax bill is more than that amount, the difference could not be deducted. The Senate bill does not include that proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sammartino said Higgins&rsquo; claim would hold up if there isn&rsquo;t a compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nine thousand would be true if it was a complete repeal,&quot; Sammartino said. &quot;But it would be something less than that&quot; with the deduction for property taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average property tax deduction is $6,522 for someone making between $75,000 and $100,000 in New York. That falls below the cap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People would be protected to some degree,&quot; Sammartino said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennedy, the spokeswoman for Higgins, said the bill still affects residents in his district, regardless of the final numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can debate the exact numbers which will be different for each taxpayer, but the bottom line is that hardworking Western New Yorkers have a lot to lose in both the Senate and House legislation which continues to change by the minute,&quot; Kennedy said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Higgins said New York state taxpayers could lose as much as 9 percent of their taxable income if state and local tax deductions end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Higgins meant to say residents would no longer be able to deduct 9 percent of their income from their federal taxes, not that they would lose that money outright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even if he said what he meant, that would still be inaccurate. House Republicans came to a compromise on property tax deductions that refute the numbers in his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-15T13:10:53.305979", "ruling_date": "2017-11-20T14:42:52", "ruling_headline": "Not all state and local tax deductions eliminated in House Republican plan", "ruling_headline_slug": "not-all-state-and-local-tax-deductions-eliminated-", "ruling_link_text": "Not all state and local taxes eliminated", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://higgins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/higgins-says-gop-tax-bill-is-a-major-liability-to-every-taxpaying\">Video of remarks from Rep.
