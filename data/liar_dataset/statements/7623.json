You would think so if you&#39;ve seen the recent <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=496698607053146&amp;set=a.192530854136591.46473.192518057471204&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Facebook posting</a>, created by a group called Anti-Republican Crusaders and shared more than 1,700 times on that and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=530255617026971&amp;set=a.362561537129714.96045.360781383974396&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1&amp;ref=nf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">another Facebook page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe posting has the Joe Friday character from TV&#39;s &quot;Dragnet&quot; saying, &quot;Just the facts, ma&#39;am,&quot; followed by this headline: &quot;Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere&#39;s also a color-coded U.S. map showing the states with the most laws and fewest deaths.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered if the Harvard study did, in fact, prove that point.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Facebook posts send readers to <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1661390\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">a study published online</a> by JAMA Internal Medicine (not the Journal of the American Medical Association, a separate medical journal, as the post reports). The team led by Eric Fleegler of Harvard and Boston Children&#39;s Hospital created a &quot;legislative strength score&quot; to gauge which states had more gun laws. Then they compared that to the state-by-state firearms death rate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe more gun laws a state had, the lower the rate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat may sound conclusive, but there&#39;s a huge caveat. As the researchers concluded: &quot;Our study could not determine cause-and-effect relationships.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere could be many other factors, such as the rate of gun ownership or a state&rsquo;s culture of gun ownership..</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCurious Facebook readers might have uncovered this if they followed a link to an interview with Fleegler conducted by Robin Young on the <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/03/13/gun-laws-study\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">March 13, 2013, edition</a> of &quot;Here &amp; Now,&quot; the news program produced by WBUR in Boston. Young zeroed in on the same problem, asking if the relevant factor could be a state&#39;s gun culture.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFleegler acknowledged the point. &quot;[It] may be true that there are states [where people] don&#39;t own a lot of guns, they&#39;re OK with passing legislation [and] they have lower rates of firearm deaths,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDr. Garen Wintemute of the University of California-Davis School of Medicine, was even blunter in <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1661391\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">a commentary</a> that JAMA Internal Medicine released at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the Fleegler team took into account the amount of gun ownership, &quot;the association between firearm laws and firearm fatalities essentially disappeared,&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother key shortcoming of the study: The scorecard used to assess how many laws a state has &quot;does not account for variations between states in the specifics of their laws and includes no measure of whether or how effectively the states enforce them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWintemute noted that while gun laws were almost certainly enacted to reduce criminal violence, their real impact was a reduction in suicide, which &quot;accounted for 94 percent of the observed decrease in firearm-related mortality.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFleegler, in his &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; interview, noted that suicide was a key factor because when people think of killing themselves, the presence of a gun means they will succeed 85 percent of the time compared to close to 2 percent when they don&#39;t have a firearm available.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the end, when the Facebook posting says &quot;Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths,&quot; it is correctly summarizing one finding of the study. But it leaves out important details and context that argue against the idea that reducing gun deaths is simply a matter of blindly passing more gun laws in each state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor that reason, we rate it<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> Half True</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
