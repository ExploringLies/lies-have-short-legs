We need to stay. We&rsquo;ve only been&rsquo; -- he thought, a terrible decision. He was right. But it cost him his governorship.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s &quot;the kind of principled leadership&quot; we need today, said Perry, a former Eagle Scout who wrote a 2008 <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/On-My-Honor-American-Fighting/dp/0979646227\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">book</a> defending the organization&rsquo;s &quot;American values&quot; and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/178hHgmaP9fzRSKNlYnKAncJmSYKx0j3tPJvs1gMCbfs/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">saying</a> it was the object of an anti-religious &quot;cultural war&quot; being waged to force the inclusion of gays, agnostics and atheists.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis comments touched off an Internet flurry of debate over whether opposing slavery could or should be equated with opposing gay admission, but we wondered about the underlying facts. Did Sam Houston, the leader of Texas&rsquo; military insurrection against Mexico, oppose slavery and say Texas shouldn&rsquo;t split from the United States over it?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHouston did lose his job as governor over secession, ending a career of representing Texans in elected office almost continuously from the Texas Revolution to the start of the Civil War. The military hero of San Jacinto became the first president of the Republic of Texas in 1836; then a representative in the Republic&rsquo;s legislature; president a second time; U.S. senator when Texas became a state in 1845; and, finally, governor starting in 1859.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Texas&rsquo; secession convention <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=8D2FE_J7KVwC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=sam+houston+kansas-nebraska+1855+resolution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YDAt8p7i0b&amp;sig=BhZe6idQcfrUkImNw-yi6aA718U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AseSUfSjDJOa8wS9kYC4Cg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20houston%20kansas-nebraska%201855%20resolution&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">removed</a> Houston as governor March 18, 1861, after he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Confederate States of America. Historians have written that Houston&rsquo;s views on secession had earlier cost him his seat in the U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs a senator, <a href=\"https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho73\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">according</a> to the Texas State Historical Association&rsquo;s Handbook of Texas, Houston angered pro-slavery factions by voting in 1848 to prohibit slavery in Oregon; supporting the delicately balanced slavery/anti-slavery decisions in the<a href=\"https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/nbc02\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> Compromise of 1850</a>; and opposing, in 1854, the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/kansas.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a> that let territories decide their own slavery status, repealing previous law that banned slavery north of latitude 36&deg;30&#39;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat guided Houston&rsquo;s thinking in these disputes was his belief in the &quot;glorious Union&quot; he had worked hard to get Texas into. The Handbook says, &quot;As senator, Houston emerged as an ardent Unionist ... a stand that made him an increasingly controversial figure. He stridently opposed the rising sectionalism of the antebellum period and delivered eloquent speeches on the issue.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry spokesman Josh Havens referred us to the 2004 biography &quot;Sam Houston,&quot; in which author James Haley described Houston the politician as treading a fine line on slavery for decades: &quot;He disliked it,&quot; Haley wrote, but &quot;recognized it as a fact of life to be dealt with.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVia email, Haley told us, &quot;Gov. Perry is right that Houston was against slavery, but as a Southern senator he was chained to it and could not openly oppose it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaley pointed us to a key <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=y3uHDkltcIQC&amp;pg=PA336&amp;lpg=PA336&amp;dq=sam+houston+boston+speech&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BjZdLjXL6d&amp;sig=2S8CqzmAZAPNKvgNU_AQLOXhcIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lyaRUcGwDYr89QTt44CICA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20houston%20boston%20speech&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">speech</a> by Houston on slavery, delivered Feb. 22, 1855,<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=y3uHDkltcIQC&amp;pg=PA336&amp;lpg=PA336&amp;dq=sam+houston+boston+speech&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BjZdLjXL6d&amp;sig=2S8CqzmAZAPNKvgNU_AQLOXhcIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lyaRUcGwDYr89QTt44CICA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20houston%20boston%20speech&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> </a>in Boston, in which the senator said the Union should not be sundered for &quot;political opinions,&quot; that slavery was natural to the Southern economy and that the North would still have slaves if it were profitable there. Emancipation, Houston said, would cast the freed man into jobless destitution: &quot;You might call him free, but he would be an object of want and wretchedness.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaley wrote, &quot;To Sam Houston, what was paramount at that time, and in that place, and during that crisis was keeping the Union together.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHouston&rsquo;s personal views on slavery are unclear. He was a slaveowner; according to his<a href=\"http://www.shsu.edu/%7Epin_www/samhouston/HouEman.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> biography online</a> at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, an inventory of his property upon his death in 1863 listed &quot;12 slaves valued at $10,530.20.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet &quot;almost all acts other than his ownership of slaves support the idea that he disagreed with slavery as an institution,&quot; the university biography said. Among examples given: &quot;While in office as president of the Republic of Texas and later as governor, he refused to permit payments to bounty hunters of escaped slaves. He also prohibited slave ships from trafficking in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of Houston&rsquo;s slaves recalled hearing him speak against the institution on the day Abraham Lincoln was elected president. In the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933337230/ref=rdr_ext_tmb\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">1940 memoir</a> &quot;My Master,&quot; Jeff Hamilton said, &quot;I heard the General say that slavery was a damnable thing at best, and that he didn&rsquo;t believe in human slavery nor in secession or disunion either. He said he hoped God might in some way perform a miracle as of old and save the country from destruction.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter Houston had helped shepherd Texas into the United States, he spoke publicly and often against ripping the Union apart over slavery. His pro-Union views and Senate votes made him anathema in Southern politics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis Senate career, the Handbook of Texas says, &quot;was effectively ended when, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=8ihOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=texas+legislature+1855+resolution+disapproving+sam+houston+kansas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WFhUExwOHc&amp;sig=RcsfSqQqwDbdYC2IyQQ4biyg3zs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HWicUY38GoOk9ASQ0oGQDQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20legislature%201855%20resolution%20disapproving%20sam%20houston%20kansas&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">in 1855</a>, the Texas Legislature <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=vcM1AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=sam+houston+kansas-nebraska+1855+resolution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CqOMrj3bEc&amp;sig=59h5CYCVXXkAsT54EZDhq2FTyQk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s8OSUe6HBIO09gTo84DQCg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20houston%20kansas-nebraska%201855%20resolution&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">officially condemned</a> his position on the Kansas-Nebraska Act,&quot; which Houston opposed &quot;because it allowed the status of slavery to be determined by popular sovereignty, a concept he saw as potentially destabilizing to the nation.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSomewhat of a lame-duck senator, Houston returned to Texas and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1857.

His platform was clear: he supported slavery, he supported the Constitution, but he pledged allegiance to the Union, come what may. It was not a popular platform, but Houston could not believe that the Texans were prepared to forsake the greater nation he had done so much to build.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom the gubernatorial pulpit, Houston kept arguing against secession on practical grounds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a Sept. 22, 1860, <a href=\"http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027787111;view=1up;seq=185\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">speech</a> in Austin, Houston said slavery was not threatened if Southern states stayed in the Union: &quot;We still have the institution of slavery.
