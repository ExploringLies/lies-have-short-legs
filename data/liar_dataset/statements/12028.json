Not only does she get to attack him on a whole host of issues where he agrees with her, but&hellip; he&#39;s described Hillary Clinton as... one of the best secretaries of state in history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz leveled a similar claim during the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican presidential debate in Houston, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/transcript-of-the-republican-presidential-debate-in-houston.html?_r=0\">saying</a>: &quot;And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times&hellip;?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered. Did Trump truly rate Clinton&rsquo;s performance as secretary of state among the best ever?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to our request for backup, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a link to a Jan. 17, 2016, <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/17/cruz-trump-online-war-heats-up/#ixzz41mHbYyJ3\">web post by The Daily Caller</a>, a conservative news site, presenting video of Trump saying on camera: &quot;And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else.&quot; A portion of the same video earlier appeared in a January 2016 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJrYxHQO-E\">Cruz campaign video</a> suggesting tight ties between Trump and Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web searches led us to the Trump clip, <a href=\"http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=5f0_1449581354&amp;comments=1\">posted</a> by someone on LiveLeak.com, a British video-sharing site, Dec. 8, 2015. Asked where the video originated, the same individual (with the screen name Exec) pointed us to video from an <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/iowa-donald-trump-warns-republicans-about-hillary-immigration-f6C10893666\">NBC News interview</a> of Trump after the builder-developer gave an Iowa talk on politics in August 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News headlined the interview by reporter Kasie Hunt: &quot;Trump: Clinton will have to defend record as secretary of state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our transcript of Trump talking to Hunt on Aug. 10 or 11, 2013, about Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt\">&quot;Well first of all, I know her very well and I know her husband very well and I like them both. And they are, uh, you know, just really terrific people. I like them both very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt\">&quot;But I think you&rsquo;ll be, you know, you&rsquo;ll be looking at the record of Hillary Clinton. And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else. You&rsquo;ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt\">&quot;I don&rsquo;t know that Benghazi, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have resonated like perhaps it should have. But many other things have come up and the world is in turmoil. And I think that a lot of people will be looking at Hillary&rsquo;s record as secretary of state and she will be defending that record. And I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll do a good job of defending it. But that will be the thing they will be going for.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt, Trump said: &quot;And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else.&quot; That&rsquo;s not explicitly best-in-history, but could be bandied in that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then again, it occurred to us, that comment could be taken as having a different scope; that is, Trump saying only that anyone appraising Clinton would focus on her record as secretary of state. (We encourage &nbsp;you to watch for yourself.) Consider this change of punctuation: &quot;And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else.&quot; Note too that Trump said next: &quot;You&rsquo;ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record,&quot; a point he made several times in the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump praised Clinton in 2012-13</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web searches led us to other instances of Trump making positive comments about Clinton&rsquo;s tenure <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/\">as secretary of state</a>, which ran from the start of Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency in 2009 through January 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2012/03/29/trump-potential-romney-running-mate-donald-blasts-obamacare-bad-business-catastrophic-us/\">Trump-Greta Van Susteren exchange</a> on the March 28, 2012 episode of &quot;On the Record,&quot; a Fox News program:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">VAN SUSTEREN: &quot;Looking at the administration, how do you think the vice president has done? (Joe) Biden, although, being a vice-president is not a job that is very visible, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I&#39;m curious what you think about those two.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">TRUMP: &quot;I think Biden has been a very loyal person, to be honest with you. I think he has been a good vice president for the agenda that they set and he has been a very, very loyal person. I respect him for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">&quot;Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. And I think, again, she&#39;s given an agenda, it is not all of her, but I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">VAN SUSTEREN: &quot;She says she&#39;s out at the end of this term. Do you think we will see her again running for office?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">TRUMP: &quot;I think so. Assuming she is healthy, I think she probably runs after the next four years, I would imagine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">VAN SUSTEREN: &quot;Do you support her?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">TRUMP: &quot;I don&#39;t want to get into this because I will get myself into trouble --&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">VAN SUSTEREN: &quot;That&#39;s why I asked you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40.5pt\">TRUMP: &quot;I just like her. I like her husband. Her husband made a speech on Monday and was very well received. He is -- he is a really good guy, and she&#39;s a really good person and woman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, a July 2012 MSNBC news story noted Trump&rsquo;s statement in an October 2013 interview with Larry King about Hillary and Bill Clinton: &quot;I like them both very much.&quot; (See Trump&rsquo;s &quot;like&quot; about the 15:46 mark of <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/shows/politicking-larry-king/donald-trump-larry-king-557/\">the King interview posted here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Trump in 2012 and 2013 indicated he personally liked Clinton and in 2012, when Clinton was still the secretary, Trump said she &quot;works hard and I think she does a good job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump in 2015</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, unnoted by Cruz, Trump has most recently been critical of Clinton&#39;s work, calling her one of the country&rsquo;s worst secretaries of state. On July 8, 2015, he sent a <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-fires-back-at-hillary-clinton-2015-7#ixzz3fK2EBQOt\">statement to the Business Insider</a> calling Clinton &quot;the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The publication said Trump issued his statement after Clinton told CNN she was disappointed in Trump&rsquo;s campaign-opening remarks about Mexican immigrants. In his June 14, 2015, kickoff, Trump <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/16/donald-trump-transcript-our-country-needs-a-truly-great-leader/\">said</a>: &quot;When Mexico sends its people, they&rsquo;re not sending their best. They&rsquo;re not sending you. They&rsquo;re not sending you. They&rsquo;re sending people that have lots of problems, and they&rsquo;re bringing those problems with us. They&rsquo;re bringing drugs. They&rsquo;re bringing crime. They&rsquo;re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said Trump has &quot;described Hillary Clinton as one of the best secretaries of state in history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the contrary, Trump last year called Clinton the worst secretary of state in history and we didn&#39;t find any instance of Trump calling Clinton one of the best ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Trump previously said he liked Clinton and even that she was doing a good job as secretary -- while, in the 2013 NBC News interview, he said: &quot;And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else.&quot; We see ambiguity in this phrasing, which could be taken as high praise or, more logically, as a clumsy rehash of Trump&rsquo;s repeatedly expressed prediction in the interview that Clinton&rsquo;s record would be a target of scrutiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> more</a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-08T11:10:29.294192", "ruling_date": "2016-03-08T18:09:35", "ruling_headline": "Ted Cruz claim about Donald Trump praising Hillary Clinton overlooks Trump calling her 'worst' ever", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-cruz-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-best-secreta", "ruling_link_text": "Of late?
