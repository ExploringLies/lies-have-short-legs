But that didn&rsquo;t stop Husted from recycling them within a more current anti-Democrat framework.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;O&rsquo;Shaughnessy even voted for her own personal stimulus package &ndash; a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself,&quot; the commercial&rsquo;s narrator says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s an accusation O&rsquo;Shaughnessy has heard before. Her opponent in a 2002 race for Franklin County Commissioner, Dewey Stokes, also produced a TV commercial that ripped O&rsquo;Shaughnessy for raising her own pay, according to the Columbus Dispatch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s campaign said she couldn&rsquo;t be blamed for boosting her pay because she was ineligible for the raise after she and the rest of Columbus City Council approved it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what&rsquo;s the truth here. PolitiFact Ohio asked Husted&rsquo;s camp to back up its statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt pointed to an ordinance Columbus City Council passed in December 1998 to increase the salaries of council members, the council president and the mayor. The ordinance, which passed unanimously 7 to 0, increased the pay of council members and the council president 34 percent in 2000, with annual bumps of 3 percent in the next three years. That meant pay for City Council members jumped from $25,000 in 1999 to $36,607 in 2003. The pay for council president jumped from $30,000 to $44,037 over the same time. All seven members of council, including O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, declined the pay raise in 2003.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Columbus city charter discourages officeholders from voting to increase their own pay with language that says a member of council must first be elected before collecting the higher pay. &quot;The salary of any officer, employee, or member of a board or commission in the unclassified service of the city who was elected or appointed for a definite term shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which the individual was elected or appointed&hellip;&quot; the charter reads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while the pay increases council approved at the end of 1998 kicked in beginning in 2000, O&rsquo;Shaughnessy was ineligible for the pay hikes in 2000 and 2001, the last two years of her first term. She didn&rsquo;t qualify for a higher salary until after re-elected in 2001. She qualified for a higher salary of $35,541 when she started her new term in the beginning of 2002.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat all this means is that when O&rsquo;Shaughnessy voted in favor of the 1998 ordinance to increase pay, there was no guarantee she would ever get the higher pay. She had to win re-election first.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s an important caveat that Husted&rsquo;s ad doesn&rsquo;t mention, and the point where Hustad&rsquo;s attack comes unraveled. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe didn&rsquo;t approve a pay raise for herself. She voted to increase pay for whomever was elected to take that council seat. The voters decided she should get the pay raise by re-electing her in 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Husted&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-07T15:08:02.695031", "ruling_date": "2010-10-07T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio Secretary of State candidate Jon Husted raps opponent Maryellen O\u2019Shaughnessy for 'her own stimulus package'", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-secretary-state-candidate-jon-husted-raps-opp", "ruling_link_text": "Voters gave her a raise when they re-elected her", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTV commercial for Jon Husted<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tColumbus City Council ordinance 3280-1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tColumbus city charter, section 15<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Ryan Frazee, spokesman for Husted&rsquo;s campaign<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Heidi Hubmann, spokeswoman for O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s campaign<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John Ivanic, spokesman for Columbus City Council<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Columbus Dispatch, &quot;Campaign Ad Watch,&quot; Oct. 30, 2002</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Ohio secretary of state", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Jon", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 739, "last_name": "Husted", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "jon-husted", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jon-husted2012-01-13-1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/739/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.sos.state.oh.us/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;O&rsquo;Shaughnessy even voted for her own personal stimulus package -- a taxpayer-funded pay raise for herself.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television campaign ad", "statement_date": "2010-09-27", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 137, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/137/", "subject": "Public Service", "subject_slug": "public-service", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Franklin County clerk of courts", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Maryellen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 654, "last_name": "O'Shaughnessy", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "maryellen-oshaughnessy", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifactohio-maryellen-oshaughnessy.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/654/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.maryellenforohio.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
