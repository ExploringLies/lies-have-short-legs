In an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-congress-video-transcript.html?_r=0\">address</a> to Congress in March, Trump said his budget &quot;calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history,&quot; which we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/01/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-historic-defense-increase/\">rated</a> Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His brag in Youngstown is more overblown, and more inaccurate. The White House did not provide information for this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increase in defense spending is not historic. Trump&rsquo;s proposed base spending cap for 2017-18 defense spending is $603 billion, a 9.4 percent increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been 10 years since 1977 when the base level&nbsp;has gone up by more than that, and in some years, the increase more than doubled Trump&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1981, President Ronald Reagan hiked the spending cap by 24.9 percent and by 20.4 percent the following year. More recently, President George W. Bush bumped spending by 10 percent in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center for Strategic and International Studies mapped these changes below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MSS4oLkBqhMRPcFq4t8WoP7UDElEkFQZ9HcwabnAoPpXKk8Njs-uwV7oLG65DjSC7Y6FS-YvVy2DzowGUMoDYxB4Z-Fj5qUrnHPmA9t0swpS3C9fGWKkiKHO3fZvfTjT44v4sydd\" style=\"border:none; height:357px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Base defense budget doesn&rsquo;t include war-related funding, though. If we were to include that funding, the statistics are less in Trump&#39;s&nbsp;favor. Trump&rsquo;s proposed budget represents a 5.4 percent increase in the total defense budget, but we&rsquo;ve also had greater increases in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Jimmy Carter increased military spending by 25 percent in 1981 and President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised the defense budget by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, Trump wasn&rsquo;t just saying he proposed one of the largest increases; he said he had already &quot;achieved&quot; it. The spending has not yet been approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To turn his proposal into a reality, Trump will need&nbsp;Congress to appropriate the necessary funding for fiscal year 2018 as well as change the budget caps currently in effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Trump&rsquo;s defense budget is $54 billion above the budget cap already set in law,&quot; said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;And to change the budget cap he needs 60 votes in the Senate, so in some ways it&rsquo;s actually more difficult to change the budget cap than to pass a health care bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Trump&rsquo;s defense, Harrison said that his proposed defense budget is among the highest in history (though still not the highest) because the proposed increase comes on top of a defense budget that is already high by historical standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump was talking specifically about an increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;We&#39;ve achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The defense spending increase Trump laid out in his 2018 budget is not an unprecedented change, regardless of whether it includes war-related spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also not the done deal Trump described. In order to actually increase defense spending, Congress will have to appropriate the funding and raise the budget cap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-26T18:07:00.982364", "ruling_date": "2017-07-27T08:00:00", "ruling_headline": "In Youngstown, Trump incorrectly says he has achieved historic increase in defense spending", "ruling_headline_slug": "its-false-trump-achieved-historic-increase-defense", "ruling_link_text": "Not historic or achieved", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Time</em>, <a href=\"http://time.com/4874161/donald-trump-transcript-youngstown-ohio/\">Trump&#39;s Ohio Rally Speech</a>, July 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whitehouse.gov, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/budget.pdf\">A New Foundation For American Greatness Fiscal Year 2018</a>, May 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/01/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-historic-defense-increase/\">&quot;Trump wrongly claims historic defense increase&quot;</a>, March 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, July 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Laicie Heeley, defense budget analyst at the Stimson Center, July 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steven Cheung, White House assistant communications director, July 26, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We&#39;ve achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2017-07-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Has Trump achieved a historic increase in defense spending?
