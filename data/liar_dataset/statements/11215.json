The question is how much it contributed to the growth of America&rsquo;s prison population.&nbsp;As we&#39;ll see, the growth of the prison population started well before the federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A &lsquo;tough-on-crime environment&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Jones suggests, the United States has the highest incarceration rate <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/aug/10/jim-webb/webb-says-us-has-worlds-highest-incarceration-rate/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>among developed nations</u></a>, at around 700 prisoners per 100,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>African-Americans in particular are locked up at disproportionate rates.

By 1987, five states had adopted sentencing guidelines for judges to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Bill Clinton took office in January&nbsp;1993 touting <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/24/us/1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-houston-speech-assails-bush-crime-issue.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a &quot;tough-on-crime&quot;&nbsp;agenda</u></a> in response to an increase in violent crime and swelling <a href=\"http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittUnderstandingWhyCrime2004.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>homicide numbers</u></a>.

Authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden, the <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/billfs.txt\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>sweeping</u></a> crime bill provided $10 billion to fund new prisons, $6.1 billion for crime prevention and money for 100,000 new police officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also enforced harsher sentencing in federal prisons and incentivized the creation of &quot;<a href=\"http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/tssp.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>truth-in-sentencing</u></a>&quot; laws at the state level. These laws require violent offenders to serve a minimum portion of their original sentence by ruling out the possibility of early parole. Under the bill, states that set this minimum at 85 percent of the sentence were granted funding for new prisons, and by 1998, 27 states and the District of Columbia had qualified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The president took the final minutes of <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/clinton/speeches/speech-3437\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>his first State of the Union</u></a> to lobby for the bill. Hillary Clinton, too, campaigned for the legislation in <a href=\"http://clinton4.nara.gov/media/text/1994-08-10-first-lady-remarks-to-the-ninth-annual-women-in-policing-awards.text\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>speeches</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/times-change-heres-hillary-clinton-in-1994-talking-up-tough\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interviews</u></a> across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill ultimately found <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00295\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>wide support</u></a> among Democrats and a handful of Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just five years after the crime bill was passed, 29 states had truth-in-sentencing laws, and 24 had three strikes laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The bill&rsquo;s effect</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So did the crime bill lead to mass incarceration?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population, has tracked the massive expansion of people in federal, local and state prisons over the past century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DRdZOhvRSvjv1CIbKg3YASblNdz2kyKG6hJ4pMCgFjGHJvY0cCAMqqwal-IGn6Q-Cld4Lula8dkMpz8TyjmmGwGDX2owhgxN_XmLRcfzf4UW9zAd2QSUwoibNuLRgnFrM12mzpf9\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:411px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the overall inmate population of the United States has grown significantly since 1994. But the sharp upward trend actually started in the early 1980s. Prisons were adding inmates in 1990 at about the same rate they were in 1997, three years after the crime bill became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the bill&rsquo;s new sentencing standards only directly applied to federal cases. But most of the growth since 1980 has taken place within state systems, which have added almost 1.25 million prisoners over that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So even though the number of people in federal prison has grown, perhaps as a result of those new standards, federal prisoners represent only a small fraction of the national prison population&rsquo;s overall growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while the bill incentivized truth-in-sentencing laws at the state level, many states had <a href=\"http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/mandatory-sentences-policy-timeline.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>already enacted</u></a> harsher laws on their own by 1994, said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/template/index.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sentencing Project</u></a>, a prison policy think tank. Mauer said it&rsquo;s hard to place the onus of responsibility solely on the Clinton-backed crime bill because the trend towards mass incarceration started as early as 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(The bill) is sometimes unfairly viewed as being <em>the </em>major factor that has contributed to high incarceration rates,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what really drove up the inmate population?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Criminal justice policy leading up to the crime bill was driven by the &lsquo;War on Drugs&rsquo; and the desire to appear &lsquo;tough on crime&rsquo; by focusing on punishment and retribution, not rehabilitation,&quot; said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice, an advocacy and research group that published a <a href=\"http://crimebill20.vera.org/justiceinfocus\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>retrospective</u></a> on the bill in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the 1994 bill was the single biggest legislative victory for the tough-on-crime movement. It &quot;certainly didn&rsquo;t help&quot; the mass incarceration epidemic, Turner said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/the-many-causes-of-americas-decline-in-crime/385364/\">Crime rates</a> have been on the decline since the early 1990s, making today&rsquo;s high incarceration levels even more apparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past few years, the Clintons have backtracked on the policies they once championed. The former president seems to regret the bill&rsquo;s passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I signed a bill that made the problem worse,&quot; he recently <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/us/politics/bill-clinton-concedes-his-crime-law-jailed-too-many-for-too-long.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>told the NAACP</u></a>. &quot;And I want to admit that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton has also called for changes to the justice system during her presidential campaign, saying <u><a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/its-time-end-era-mass-incarceration/\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-decoration: none;\">in an April 2015 speech</a>&nbsp;that &quot;we don&#39;t want to create another &#39;incarceration generation.&#39; &quot;</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&#39;s campaign highlighted&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/darrensands/blacklivesmatter-boston-releases-first-videos-of-exchange-wi#.mwJWEa16O\">its transcript </a>of her exchange with&nbsp;Black Lives Matter activists where she concedes that &quot;what was tried and how&nbsp;it was implemented has not produced the kinds of outcomes that any of&nbsp;us would want.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones said, &quot;The policy mistakes that (Hillary) and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Hillary Clinton as first lady had no official role in voting for or signing the 1994 crime bill, she certainly championed some of its policies that are now partially blamed for the growth of the prison population, such as longer, tougher prison sentences.
