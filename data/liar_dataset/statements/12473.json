The third paragraph on the about page of McGinty&rsquo;s website touts a claim we often hear about candidates from less privileged upbringings: &quot;She was the first in her family to go to a four-year college.&quot; Keep an eye on that phrasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout her campaign, McGinty has returned to this theme. She was quoted by the <em>AP </em>in January <a href=\"http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20160103/NEWS/160109930\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>saying</u></a>, &quot;As&nbsp;the ninth of 10 kids and the first in my family to go to college, I&rsquo;ve been privileged to live the American dream.&quot; This week, McGinty&rsquo;s account tweeted what appeared to be a comment from a college student <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatieMcGintyPA/status/738051863107379200\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>saying</u></a> &quot;Katie understands what I&rsquo;m going through.

We were all really proud of that, just as we were proud that I earned my degree by completing a two-year program and then enrolling in La Salle.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate candidate Katie McGinty&rsquo;s campaign website claims she was first person in her family to go to a four-year college. She&rsquo;s elided this statement further through the course of her campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But documentation from La Salle, a four-year institution, shows her brother, John McGinty, graduated from the university in 1973 with a bachelor&rsquo;s of arts, and the university confirmed to <em>Buzzfeed</em> he started attending the school in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John took a different route to a four-year college by first attending Philadelphia Community College, so McGinty was the first in her family to attend *only* a four-year college directly out of high school. But the language used on McGinty&rsquo;s website and at other times throughout her campaign doesn&rsquo;t include this important distinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate McGinty&rsquo;s claim Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-03T11:01:20.220713", "ruling_date": "2016-06-03T10:57:33", "ruling_headline": "Rating Katie McGinty\u2019s curious campaign college claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "rating-katie-mcgintys-curious-campaign-college-cla", "ruling_link_text": "La Salle is definitely a four-year college", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&amp;context=commencement_programs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdigitalcommons.lasalle.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1041%2526context%253Dcommencement_programs%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNF-i2gbcy4iKWT215uUuJwvZqDRjQ#search=%22http%3A%2F%2Fdigitalcommons.lasalle.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1041%26context%3Dcommencement_programs%22\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(38, 138, 140); line-height: inherit; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">1973 Commencement Program</a>, La Salle University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John P.
