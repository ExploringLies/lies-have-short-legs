Last election season, that&#39;s just what politicians promised.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGov.-elect Nathan Deal&#39;s commercials focused on bringing &quot;real jobs for real people.&quot; His Democratic foe, former Gov. Roy Barnes, said he would put the state &quot;back to work.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut during a boot camp for state legislators in December, prominent economist David Wyss said there&#39;s little Georgia government can do to kick-start the labor market for the near term. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It doesn&rsquo;t work well on the state level because states can&rsquo;t run budget deficits,&quot; Wyss said in a Dec. 13 article in The Florida Times-Union. He is chief economist for the credit rating company Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So anything you do in reducing taxes has to come back with a reduction in spending, which basically wipes out any stimulus you get,&quot; he said<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReally? But what about all those promises politicians made?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJobs were a central issue during the elections. <font color=\"#000000\">A poll conducted before the primaries for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other papers found that across party, gender and racial lines, Georgians were worried about their economic futures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree in four had<font color=\"#000000\"> qualms about their household finances and job security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgians still have good reason to be anxious. Unemployment hovered just above 10 percent in November, according to the state Department of Labor. </font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWyss also spoke during a biennial conference of state legislators sponsored by the University of Georgia. The meeting updated lawmakers on the issues they face starting Monday, when the 2011 legislative session begins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Wyss, who stressed that state government can enact policies that foster long-term job growth. They can train a work force specifically suited for a business&#39;s needs, for instance, or collaborate with local universities to foster technological innovation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStates such as Georgia also have agencies specifically charged with economic development. And governors have been known to go on trade missions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those efforts, too, are aimed at creating jobs in the long term.<br />\r\n\tWyss was talking about the short term. And in the short term, state legislators and governors don&#39;t have many options.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia and other states have to balance their budgets -- it&#39;s a constitutional requirement in Georgia. So if the state decides to cut taxes to stimulate business growth, it has to come up with the lost revenue somewhere else, Wyss said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means government spending cuts. It could even mean layoffs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&#39;s no free lunch here,&quot; Wyss said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAJC PolitiFact Georgia asked seven experts with wide-ranging perspectives for their input. For the most part, they agreed with Wyss&#39; assessment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a Libertarian-influenced think tank, called the idea &quot;absolutely correct.&quot; If a state spends money to spur job growth, lawmakers have to make cuts elsewhere.<br />\r\n\t<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\" />\r\n\tJon Shure, deputy director of the State Fiscal Project for the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed with Wyss as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Short-term job gains are dictated mostly by the economy. And those are mostly regional, national and global issues,&quot; Shure said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne slight exception was Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He said tax cuts could bring a &quot;marginal&quot; improvement in the short term and are worth trying, but they can&#39;t bring a big boost.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There is no magic wand,&quot; Riedl said. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that experts placed the state&#39;s ability to create jobs for the short term between limited and marginal. None argued that state government could cause an immediate, major gain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find Wyss&#39; statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-04T17:28:18.725140", "ruling_date": "2011-01-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Economist says state can do little for short-term job growth", "ruling_headline_slug": "economist-says-state-can-do-little-short-term-job-", "ruling_link_text": "Sorry.
