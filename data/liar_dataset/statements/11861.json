Now he says he&#39;s very pro-life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am so glad Mr. Trump has seen the light,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=ab367034-9a38-4657-898c-ee5ec7a3cf60\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Palin responded</u></a>, saying it was sad that anti-abortion groups were giving the candidate a hard time about his switch when other people who have had a change of heart on the issue have been celebrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She cited, as an example, singer Justin Bieber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapper didn&#39;t quite understand and, in essence, asked her, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK_0jXPuIr0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>what do you mean?</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bieber &quot;has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him,&quot; Palin said. &quot;He&rsquo;s just one example.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether the pop star really had the same type of conversion as Trump or whether Palin had gone <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UoQU0rGkIU\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>overboard.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/11/carly-fiorina/fiorina-trumps-abortion-flip-flop/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>change of position</u></a>&nbsp;on the abortion question is well-established. When Trump was first considering a third-party presidential run in 1999, he said on NBC&#39;s <em>Meet the Press</em> that although he hated the concept of abortion, &quot;I am pro-choice in every respect.&quot; By mid&nbsp;February 2011, when there was talk again that he would run for president, he declared, &quot;I am pro-life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the&nbsp;Biebs transitioned from abortion support to abortion opposition is not as clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Palin through her political action committee and sought comment from Bieber through the office of his manager, Scooter Braun. We didn&#39;t hear back from either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we decided to try to find out for ourselves. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=154himd-3ZE\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>No pressure</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only reference to the abortion issue we could find was <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/justin-bieber-talks-sex-politics-music-and-puberty-in-new-rolling-stone-cover-story-20110216\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bieber&#39;s interview with </u><em><u>Rolling Stone</u></em></a><em>,</em> published in February 2011. He was 16 at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I really don&#39;t believe in abortion. I think (an embryo) is a human,&quot; Bieber told the magazine. &quot;It&#39;s like killing a baby.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was asked about abortion in cases of rape, his response was, &quot;Um. Well, I think that&#39;s really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I don&#39;t know how that would be a reason. I guess I haven&#39;t been in that position, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to judge that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rape comment in particular caused some controversy at the time, and since then Bieber has shied away from the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He got drawn back into it peripherally when his mother, Pattie Mallette, a born-again Christian, promoted a short anti-abortion film in 2013. Mallette had previously written of the pressure she experienced to have an abortion when she was 17 and carrying the now-pop superstar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em> said in a Jan. 21, 2013, story that it had spoken with an unnamed &quot;longtime Bieber associate&quot; who claimed, &quot;I don&#39;t believe he agrees with his mom on this issue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some might interpret that to mean that Bieber is now pro-abortion &mdash; which would signal a new position on abortion that, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRh_vgS2dFE\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>sorry</u></a>, does not fit Palin&rsquo;s point. However, PolitiFact has a policy of not relying on unnamed or secondhand sources to speak for what others believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palin said Bieber &quot;has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At PolitiFact, we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j97bd6Cjp2U\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>believe</u></a> it&#39;s the responsibility of the person making a claim to provide the evidence to back it up. Palin didn&#39;t respond to our query.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only reasonable conclusion at this point is that Bieber hasn&rsquo;t changed his position on abortion like Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, we <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_Z5-P9v3F8w\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>never say never</u></a>: If on-the-record evidence of Bieber supporting abortion prior to his <em>Rolling Stone</em> interview turns up, we&#39;ll consider a different ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until then, Palin&rsquo;s claim is not substantiated.
