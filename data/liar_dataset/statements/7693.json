Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, who like the school boards&rsquo; group depended on preliminary spending estimates calculated by the National Education Association, the nation&rsquo;s largest teachers union. In February 2012, the association said that Texas schools are spending $8,400 per student this year on items such as salaries for school personnel, student transportation, school books and energy. Its breakdown suggests Texas&rsquo; per-student expenditures trailed such spending in every state but two.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose calculations place Texas 48th among the states in per-student spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd how might someone conclude, like the school boards&rsquo; association, that Texas ranks 49th?&nbsp; The compiled figures, shown on Summary Table K in the association&rsquo;s report, downloadable <a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/img/content/NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates-2013_%282%29.pdf\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-48bc570c-3cf8-70be-a15c-e888644c4eaf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">here</a>, reflect spending within each state plus schools in the District of Columbia, which has current estimated expenditures of more than $14,000 per student. Consequently, the Texas spending level falls 49th among the 50 states plus D.C.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy phone, Catherine Clark, associate executive director of the school boards&rsquo; association, confirmed that the group relied on the NEA calculations in declaring Texas as 49th in education spending among the states. If spending in the D.C. schools figures into that conclusion, Clark said, &quot;then we&rsquo;re wrong.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group said Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas ranks 48th among the states, according to preliminary figures, and 49th only if one also considers spending in the schools in Washington, D.C., which is not a state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis claim is close to accurate, but without the D.C. clarification, it rates as Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-04-24T12:49:51.341725", "ruling_date": "2013-04-24T15:28:50", "ruling_headline": "Association says Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states", "ruling_headline_slug": "association-says-texas-ranks-49th-pupil-funding-am", "ruling_link_text": "Counts D.C. as a state", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTelephone interview, Catherine Clark, associate executive director, Texas Association of School Boards, April 24, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTruth-O-Meter article, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/apr/18/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-ranks-49th-what-it-doing-pu/\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-48bc570c-3cf2-b815-aa74-34a4e8f4c4e4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">&quot;Wendy Davis says Texas ranks 49th in what it is doing in per-pupil education spending,&quot;</a> PolitiFact Texas, April 18, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReport, <a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/img/content/NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates-2013_%282%29.pdf\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-48bc570c-3cf3-06ec-694e-bded3881a826\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">&quot;Rankings &amp; Estimates, Rankings of the States 2012 and Estimates of School Statistics 2013,&quot;</a> National Education Association, December 2012 (downloaded April 12, 2013)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Organization", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Texas", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 2268, "last_name": "Association of School Boards", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "texas-association-school-boards", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/tasbpftnew.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2268/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.tasb.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an advertisement.", "statement_date": "2013-04-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
