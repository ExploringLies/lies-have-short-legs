Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson&rsquo;s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of &lsquo;truth&rsquo;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson also has portrayed President-Elect Donald Trump as part of work for <em><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/photos/2016/09/alison-jackson-donald-trump\">Vanity Fair</a></em>. She has a new book with her images, entitled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Private-2016-Alison-Jackson/dp/1911556002/ref=la_B0034OSIP8_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479247318&amp;sr=1-1\"><em>Private 2016,</em>&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Private-2016-Alison-Jackson/dp/1911556002/ref=la_B0034OSIP8_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479247318&amp;sr=1-1\">available on Amazon</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a spokeswoman, Jackson told us that she is &quot;delighted one of my works is part of the &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; movement. ...&nbsp;My work is about celebrities and public figures in private, things we have all imagined but never seen before.
