The article did say pundits attacked Conway for the comment. We couldn&rsquo;t find any instance of a reliable media report that corroborated the story, or any pundit who reacted to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also said Conway drew criticism on social media, but good luck finding anything on this specific (fake) comment that doesn&rsquo;t track back to LondonWebNews.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site does not appear to be filled <em>entirely </em>with fictional stories, like some fake news websites. It looked to include posts taken from many places, including reliable news sources. One post, for example, was about the June 14, 2017, <a href=\"http://londonwebnews.com/2017/06/14/grenfell-tower-west-london-engulfed-fire/\">Grenfell Tower fire</a> in London. This kind of mix would make it very difficult for a reader to be able to discern this particular item is fabricated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://londonwebnews.com/privacy-policy-and-disclaimer/\">disclaimer said only that the site</a> made &quot;no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability&quot; of anything it posted. &quot;Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk,&quot; it warned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tried to contact LondonNewsWeb.com via the email address provided on the site&nbsp;but didn&rsquo;t receive a response. There was no byline listed with the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did reach a White House spokesman, who didn&rsquo;t want to give an official comment about the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s no proof Conway made this comment, either way. It looks as if the website (or its original source) made the story up entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-20T10:45:06.647005", "ruling_date": "2017-06-20T11:12:25", "ruling_headline": "Kellyanne Conway did not say liberal women hate her for being intelligent, attractive", "ruling_headline_slug": "kellyanne-conway-did-not-say-liberal-women-hate-he", "ruling_link_text": "Smart money says this is pretty fake", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>LondonWebNews.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://londonwebnews.com/2017/06/01/liberal-women-hate-me-because-of-my-striking-beauty-and-intellect-says-kellyanne-conway/\">Liberal Women Hate Me Because Of My &quot;Striking Beauty And Intellect&quot;, Says Kellyanne Conway</a>,&quot; June 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Steven Cheung, White House spokesman, June 15, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3976, "last_name": "LondonWebNews.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "londonwebnewscom", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3976/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://londonwebnews.com"}, "statement": "<p>Says Kellyanne Conway said liberal women hate her because of her &quot;striking beauty and intellect.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an Internet post", "statement_date": "2017-06-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
