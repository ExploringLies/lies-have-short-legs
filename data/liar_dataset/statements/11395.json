The deficit has not been going up; it has been coming down -- precipitously. We&rsquo;ve cut our deficits by two-thirds. They&rsquo;re below the average deficits over the past 40 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have previously rated Obama&rsquo;s claim that &quot;we&#39;ve cut the deficit by two-thirds&quot; as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-deficit-has-decreased-two-thir/\">Mostly True</a>. But we hadn&rsquo;t heard the other claim -- that today, the deficit is &quot;below the average deficits over the past 40 years.&quot; So we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists tend to make long-term comparisons using a measurement of the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. (The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the overall size of the U.S. economy.) Looking at the deficit as a percentage of GDP takes account of the economy&rsquo;s dramatic growth since 1975. A larger economy can sustain a larger budget, and thus a larger deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using that yardstick, Obama&rsquo;s claim is on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We calculated the current deficit as a percentage of GDP by dividing the Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s $426 billion deficit estimate (<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50724-Update-OneColumn_1.pdf\">which was released in September</a>) by the nearly $18 trillion estimate for GDP in 2015 (<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50808-MBR.pdf\">which was released in August</a>). That works out to a deficit that&rsquo;s 2.4 percent of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does that figure compare? We looked at historical data for the deficit as a percentage of GDP going back to 1975, as published by the Office of Management and Budget. When we averaged those annual percentages, the average worked out to be a little under 3.2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would make Obama&rsquo;s claim correct. Indeed, the percentage has fallen from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 2.4 percent today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be easier to visualize through the graph below. The blue line shows the deficit as a percentage of GDP, year by year, for the last 40 years, with the red line denoting the 40-year average. Though the percentage has been quite a bit above-average for most of Obama&rsquo;s tenure, it has fallen significantly and has now fallen below the 40-year average, at least based on current-year estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mck1iguaYg7mcsI7UbURov-S7Uegdnj7MECZyVDXpebupmoPjl-IQZVDuwtyxB_zwiQ-QMmlwhrlRrQXAvhfcGy8JA2Jq1gSBDes8f3vk1eMrRB6qMwj398-Er2jiriejObE6On8\" style=\"border:none; height:364px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even if you keep unusually high percentages during the Obama years out of the calculation and limit the comparison to 1975 to 2008, the current level (a deficit that&rsquo;s 2.4 percent of GDP) is still slightly lower than the average going back to 1975 (2.5 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our previous fact-checks of Obama&rsquo;s claims on the deficit, we&rsquo;ve noted that Obama has glossed over the long-term outlook, which is not as rosy. Programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will become increasingly expensive as the Baby Boom generation ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be seen in <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50724-Update-OneColumn_1.pdf\">the following graph from the Congressional Budget Office</a>. Over the next decade, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is set to push closer and closer to 4 percent, which is above the average level for the past 40 years. (In this graph, deficit percentage figures are shown as negative, rather than as positive in the graph above.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lONowEG8qZ4eQfHKUjrslR-7iuDOyGCuq1hnnOy8_BYqgKgP5yCrlg_j-_GrWCOkUeq7_ccO3dlm5RsNpr10eYfBmLjodcQ8SfzQRhNiT4ej-G3OCjw0RsNtG9dseMjMDOW4yPHe\" style=\"border:none; height:369px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said today&rsquo;s deficit is &quot;below the average deficits over the past 40 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s correct when measuring the deficit as a percentage of GDP, which is the yardstick most economists tend to use when making deficit comparisons over long periods of time. Still, Obama didn&rsquo;t specify that he was talking about deficits as a percentage of GDP, and the comparison&rsquo;s accuracy depends on the absence of major budgetary and economic changes between now and time the fiscal 2015 data are finalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-06T15:05:00.204821", "ruling_date": "2015-10-06T18:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says deficit is now below its 40-year average", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-deficit-now-below-its-40-year-av", "ruling_link_text": "When measured as a percentage of GDP", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/02/press-conference-president\">remarks at a press conference</a>, Oct. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/hist01z1.xls\">Table 1.1&mdash;Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789&ndash;2020</a>, accessed Oct. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/hist01z2.xls\">Table 1.2&mdash;Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930&ndash;2020</a>, accessed Oct. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50724-Update-OneColumn_1.pdf\">An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025</a>,&quot; August 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50808-MBR.pdf\">Monthly Budget Review for August 2015</a>,&quot; Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Oct. 6, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Today, the deficit is &quot;below the average deficits over the past 40 years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press conference", "statement_date": "2015-10-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
