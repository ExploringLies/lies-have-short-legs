It doesn&#39;t require any registration, whatsoever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton made several claims about Florida&rsquo;s law. We&#39;ll go through them one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mateen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/orlando-nightclub-massacre-suspect-fbi-guns-buy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>used a .223-caliber assault rifle described as an&nbsp;AR type rifle&nbsp;and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the attacks.</u></a> Both were purchased legally in recent days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/ATFHQ/status/742105007693156352&#10;&#10;\" width=\"550\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gun laws in Florida</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton spokesman<strong> </strong>Josh Schwerin led us to the <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/florida-state-law-summary/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence for evidence of this claim</u></a>, which focuses on providing legal expertise in support of gun laws that reduce the number of gun-related deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website makes the same assertion Clinton made on CNN: Florida doesn&rsquo;t regulate assault rifles, .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines, nor does it require the registration of firearms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The definition of assault rifle varies, but it most often describes military-like rifles or semi-automatic rifles that may include detachable magazines. (The AR type&nbsp;weapon Mateen used certainly would qualify.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.50-caliber rifles can shoot from long distances with accuracy (they use wider ammunition) and large-capacity ammunition magazines allow the shooter to fire multiple rounds before having to reload. Mateen did not have a .50-caliber rifle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton is correct that Florida places no additional regulations on owning those types of firearms or accessories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as registration, Florida law prohibits keeping a registry of legally bought firearms. &quot;A list, record, or registry of legally owned firearms or law-abiding firearm owners is not a law enforcement tool and can become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm and exercise their Second Amendment &hellip;&quot; chapter <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0790/Sections/0790.335.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>790.355 reads</u></a>. Florida does require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, but those records are sealed from the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research said that Clinton&rsquo;s claim is &quot;true on all fronts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University agreed that Clinton is correctly reciting specific parts of Florida gun law. But Kleck cautioned about singling out Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state, he said,<strong> </strong>is &quot;essentially identical to most other states with regard to these kinds of gun controls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kleck said that only seven states including Washington<strong> </strong>D.C. ban some type of assault weapons, while the other 43 regulate them the same as other types of guns. He also said only two other states and Washington<strong> </strong>D.C. prohibit .50 caliber firearms and eight states ban large capacity magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For good or ill, (Florida) is squarely in the American mainstream regarding the gun controls that Clinton mentions,&quot; Kleck said. &quot;Consequently one cannot legitimately argue (or hint) that this mass shooting was especially likely to occur in Florida because it lacked these controls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that Florida&rsquo;s gun laws don&rsquo;t regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines or require a permit or registration to purchase a gun. There&rsquo;s no denying that Clinton described Florida law correctly. But an expert cautions that Florida law isn&rsquo;t all that different than many places across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ac283bed-3a7e-4e3e-8f5d-167ef2ef7a3c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ac283bed-3a7e-4e3e-8f5d-167ef2ef7a3c</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-13T17:07:36.193761", "ruling_date": "2016-06-13T17:34:39", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton criticizes Fla. gun laws after Orlando mass shooting", "ruling_headline_slug": "clinton-mostly-right-about-florida-gun-laws", "ruling_link_text": "Florida law is like most in the U.S.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Guardian, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/orlando-nightclub-massacre-suspect-fbi-guns-buy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pulse nightclub attack: questions over how suspect on FBI&#39;s radar could buy guns</u></a>,&quot; June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/florida-state-law-summary/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Florida State Law Summary,&quot;</u></a> accessed June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, <a href=\"http://gunlawscorecard.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;2015 Gun Law State Scorecard,&quot;</u></a> accessed June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online Sunshine, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0790/0790ContentsIndex.html&amp;StatuteYear=2016&amp;Title=-%3E2016-%3EChapter%20790\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The 2016 Florida Statutes: Weapons and Firearms</u></a>&quot;, accessed June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Hillary Clinton spokesperson Josh Schwerin, June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Gary Kleck, criminology professor at Florida State University, June 13 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/even-defining-assault-weapons-is-complicated.html?pagewanted=all\">Even Defining &lsquo;Assault Rifles&rsquo; Is Complicated</a>,&quot; Jan. 16, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Florida doesn&#39;t regulate assault weapons or .50 caliber rifles or large-capacity ammunition magazines.
