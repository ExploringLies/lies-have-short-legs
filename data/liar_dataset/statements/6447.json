A July 9 <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/texas-gop-rejects-critical-thinking-skills-really/2012/07/08/gJQAHNpFXW_blog.html\">blog entry</a> was headlined &quot;Texas GOP rejects &lsquo;critical thinking&rsquo; skills.

Her column gives no information about her claim beyond that single sentence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe pulled the complete wording of the &quot;Knowledge-Based Education&quot; plank from the 2012 platform:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:27pt; margin-right:40.5pt\">We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student&rsquo;s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNext, we contacted Elam, who told us by email that party chairman Steve Munisteri had given a good explanation in <a href=\"http://www.kvue.com/news/Texas-GOP-chair-explains-controversial-critical-thinking-platform-language-163615606.html\">a July 24 interview</a> with Austin&rsquo;s KVUE-TV.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMunisteri told KVUE, &quot;The platform plank is against a specific type of teaching called &#39;outcome-based education.&#39;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The reason why critical thinking is mentioned is some places try to disguise the program of outcome-based education and just re-label it as &#39;critical thinking.&#39; &quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat&rsquo;s supported by the wording in the platform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing the lead of a July 6, 2012, <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/what-were-they-thinking/33367\">blog post</a> on the Texas platform fracas, we looked back to the <a href=\"http://tcgop.org/about-tcgop/2010-republican-party-of-texas-platform/\">2010 platform</a>. Its &quot;Knowledge-Based Education&quot; plank said, &quot;The primary purpose of public schools is to teach critical thinking skills, reading, writing, arithmetic, phonics, history, science, and character &hellip; We oppose Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and similar programs.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth platforms support critical thinking when it comes to &quot;controversial theories&quot; such as evolution, which &quot;should be taught as challengeable scientific theories ... Teachers and students should be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these theories openly and without fear of retribution or discrimination of any kind.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext, we set out to see if we could determine whether opposing outcome-based education is also, de facto, opposing critical thinking in the larger sense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe debate over outcome-based education caught fire in the 1990s as outcome-based curricula were installed in U.S. school districts. In the Lexis newspaper archive and on the web, we saw a dozen news stories and opinion pieces from as many states -- Texas included -- describing public concern about the new approach.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOpponents said the outcome-based approach was antithetical to critical thinking. They claimed it &quot;dumbed down&quot; curricula and influenced students to adopt liberal attitudes because the &quot;outcome&quot; of their studies was predetermined by academia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSupporters claimed it encouraged -- in fact, taught -- critical thinking. Rather than testing students on facts learned by rote memorization, they said, it required children to demonstrate that they had learned to analyze the material.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what the heck is it? The news stories we read indicate outcome-based education takes different forms nearly everywhere it&rsquo;s applied. The <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em> gave a description in an Oct. 30, 1996, news story about opposition to OBE-like elements in the state&rsquo;s planned education overhaul:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt; margin-right:40.5pt\">Under outcome-based education, academic and personal goals are set for students before they can graduate. The program stresses that children are not allowed to fail, so they might be given the same test or report over and over until they do the work satisfactorily. It also may eliminate traditional grades, competitive student assessments and distinct subjects and grade levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt; margin-right:40.5pt\">Methods of implementing outcome-based education include awarding group grades instead of individual grades and eliminating honors programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;founding father&quot; of OBE, education reformer William Spady, gave an example in an <a href=\"http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational_leadership/dec92/vol50/num04/On_Outcome-Based_Education@_A_Conversation_with_Bill_Spady.aspx\">interview</a> for the December 1992/January 1993 issue of <em>Educational Leadership</em> magazine, published by ASCD (formerly the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAsked whether an outcome might be &quot;The student will be able to list the five causes of the Civil War,&quot; Spady replied: &quot;No, sorry; that is not an exit outcome. But, &lsquo;Identify and explain the fundamental causes and consequences of the Civil War&rsquo; would be an enabling outcome worth pursuing en route to some larger exit outcome.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, a divide remains between the &quot;OBE teaches kids to think&quot; side and the &quot;OBE suppresses thinking&quot; side.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe didn&rsquo;t find allusions to &quot;critical thinking skills&quot; being used as a code phrase for OBE, but did note that a Feb. 15, 1994, news story in the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> said some educators were avoiding the name &quot;outcomes-based education&quot;:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt; margin-right:36pt\">Because of the controversy, many educators are going to great lengths to avoid being associated with outcomes-based education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt; margin-right:36pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt; margin-right:36pt\">&quot;We&#39;ve always had outcomes,&quot; said state school board member Diane Patrick. But &quot;we&#39;d be foolish to call it outcomes-based education right now. That would be very unwise.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Collins says, the Texas GOP platform does state that the party opposes &quot;critical thinking.&quot; But Collins leaves out some important context. The platform makes it clear that its opposition is centered on one type of education model: outcome-based education.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat&rsquo;s just the kind of situation addressed in PolitiFact&rsquo;s definition of Half True: &quot;The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy those lights, Collins&rsquo; statement is Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-11T00:46:07.554097", "ruling_date": "2012-08-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gail Collins says Texas GOP platform calls for schools to stop teaching \u201ccritical thinking\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "gail-collins-says-texas-gop-platform-calls-schools", "ruling_link_text": "Critical omission", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>The New York Times</em>, column by Gail Collins, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/opinion/collins-for-god-texas-and-golf.html\">&quot;For God, Texas and golf,&quot;</a> Aug. 1, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, column by Ken Herman, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/opinion/insight/know-your-platforms-2420187.html\">&quot;Know your platforms,&quot;</a> July 21, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRepublican Party of Texas <a href=\"http://www.texasgop.org/about-the-party\">2012 platform</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nKVUE-TV Austin news story, <a href=\"http://www.kvue.com/news/Texas-GOP-chair-explains-controversial-critical-thinking-platform-language-163615606.html\">&quot;Texas GOP chair explains controversial &#39;critical thinking&#39;
