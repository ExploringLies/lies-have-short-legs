As evidence, Nelson presented a note she said Moore wrote in her high school yearbook before the incident took place. Nelson has been represented by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inscription reads, &quot;To a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below the signature reads 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore&rsquo;s defenders have <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/11/must-see-roy-moore-signature-inside-accusers-yearbook-written-two-different-color-inks/\">pointed</a> <a href=\"https://www.metabunk.org/explained-roy-moore-two-color-yearbook-signature-depth-of-field-chromatic-aberration.t9253/\">out</a> the date and place seem to have been written in different ink and handwriting than the note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Dec. 8<em> <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roy-moore-accuser-beverly-young-nelson-pray-hes/story?id=51666016\">Good Morning America</a></em> interview with Nelson about Moore&rsquo;s response to the allegations (he <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roy-moores-attorney-disputes-yearbook-note/\">denies</a> them) and her experience since taking her story public, Nelson addressed the inconsistency. Nelson said she added the date and place of the inscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He signed your yearbook?&quot; <em>ABC News </em>reporter Tom Llamas asked Nelson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He did sign it,&quot; Nelson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And you made some notes underneath?&quot; Llamas asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Nelson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nelson said she did make notes to the inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore,&quot; the video voiceover says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To summarize, Nelson says she added the time and location to the inscription. But she says the note and signature was from Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not what the headlines of the Gateway Pundit, Breitbart or Silence is Consent. All three say Nelson said she either tampered with Moore&rsquo;s signature or forged the inscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, the Gateway Pundit wrote that &quot;Nelson admitting that she added to Moore&rsquo;s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin,&quot; the story reads. &quot;Allred&rsquo;s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fox News </em>made a similar misstatement in their headline and story about the<em> ABC</em> report, which they later walked back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama Senate candidate,&quot; the original <em>Fox News </em>headline <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LisPower1/status/939179821011230720\">read</a>. It was later edited to say she <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/08/roy-moore-accuser-admits-forged-part-yearbook-inscription-attributed-to-alabama-senate-candidate.html\">wrote</a>, rather than forged, part of the inscription. The story did not include a clarification or correction when we last looked at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original <em>Fox News</em> story also said Nelson &quot;wrote part of the disputed note&quot; without specifying what she wrote, whereas the edited version clarified that &quot;she added the date and place in the inscription.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gateway Pundit&rsquo;s headline reads &quot;WE CALLED IT!

She said she added a time and location below the signature. Nelson still attributes the note and signature to Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Correction (Dec. 11, 2017): We originally described the women&#39;s allegations against Roy Moore as sexual assault.
