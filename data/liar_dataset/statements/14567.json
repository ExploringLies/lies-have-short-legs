The content of the post hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we first saw the post, there have&nbsp;been only three hurricanes&nbsp;in the Atlantic: Jose, Maria and Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT2+shtml/222033.shtml?\">Jose</a>, which was quickly downgraded to a tropical storm when it came close to the East Coast, has fallen off the National Hurricane Center radar since Sept. 22. <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at5.shtml?cone#contents\">Maria</a> has moved north off the shores of North Carolina and is predicted to move northeast, farther away from the East Coast. And <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?cone#contents\">Lee</a> remains a idle swirl in the middle of the Atlantic with no apparent intent to touch American shores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Hurricane Center has yet to issue anything more severe than a tropical storm warning for any of these storms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the post is false, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center advises people to stay vigilant during this active hurricane season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since May, the National Weather Service has forecast that this year&rsquo;s Atlantic hurricane season would be more active than past seasons. On Aug. 9, they updated their forecast, stating that this may be <a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/early-season-storms-one-indicator-of-active-atlantic-hurricane-season-ahead\">the most active hurricane season since 2010. </a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, in the eyes of the National Hurricane Center, the react365.com claim is still nothing more than fake news and, according to Feltgen, &quot;totally unfounded, totally baseless and totally irresponsible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim as Pants on Fire! &nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-25T16:47:10.051211", "ruling_date": "2017-09-25T17:04:09", "ruling_headline": "12 hurricanes coming toward U.S.?
