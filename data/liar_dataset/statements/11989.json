Ted Cruz suggested on <em>Meet the Press.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There have been multiple media reports about Donald&#39;s business dealings with the mob, with the mafia,&quot; Cruz <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-february-28-2016-n527506\">said</a> Feb. 28. &quot;Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressed by host Chuck Todd to back up his claim, Cruz cited reports by ABC and CNN. A&nbsp;Cruz spokesman forwarded us <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/trump-swam-in-mob-infested-waters-in-early-years-as-an-nyc-developer/2015/10/16/3c75b918-60a3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/will-donald-trumps-ties-to-a-criminal-hurt-his-campaign/article/2569496\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/31/politics/trump-mob-mafia/\">media</a> <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/donald-trump-advisor-ties-mafia-article-1.2461229\">reports</a> detailing the real estate developer&rsquo;s alleged ties to organized crime. The Trump campaign did not get back to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Cruz right that the Donald has worked with a few Dons in his career?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/politifactgive\"><strong>HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA&nbsp;FACT-CHECKER</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Trump hasn&rsquo;t been charged with any illegal activity, and it&rsquo;s reasonable to argue that he was unaware or even a victim in some cases. But Cruz has a point that the mogul has been linked to the mob for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mob control a &lsquo;fact of life&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we detail Trump&rsquo;s alleged ties, none of this proves that Trump was happy doing business with the mafia or even in cahoots with them at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>La Cosa Nostra had a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=DkYTCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gotham+Unbound&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV4Nrn6p3LAhXLKCYKHf8YBZIQuwUIOzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cosa%20Nostra%20dominated%20this%20entire%20subindustry%20for%20several%20years.%22&amp;f=false\">virtual monopoly</a> on concrete in New York at the time Trump was adding his name to its skyline in the 1980s. And the mafia&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/30/nyregion/mob-role-in-new-york-construction-depicted.html\">control</a> over building supplies and labor unions meant that the crime families had a hand in most construction projects in Manhattan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump and other major developers &quot;had to adapt to that situation&quot; or build elsewhere, said James B. Jacobs, a mafia expert who was part of a state task force on organized crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That was the fact of life, that was the way it was,&quot; he told PolitiFact. &quot;The contractors and developers weren&rsquo;t pure victims. You could bribe the mob-controlled union leaders and get relief from the more arduous conflicts. But we had no information that Trump was any different.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, Trump&rsquo;s business dealings with the mob or mob-related characters are widely documented. Let&rsquo;s run through them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mafia concrete for Trump Plaza</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump was first tied to the mafia in the 1980s, when a $7.8 million subcontract for Trump Plaza&nbsp;was awarded to S&amp;A Concrete, according to <em><a href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1988/06/06/70628/index.htm\">Fortune</a></em>. The company, as Cruz correctly says, was partially owned by Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump himself acknowledged as much in a December 2015 <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-the-goodfellas-1449877685\">interview</a> with the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, admitting that S&amp;A Concrete was &quot;supposedly associated with the mob.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Virtually every building that was built was built with these companies,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;These guys were excellent contractors. They were phenomenal. They could do three floors a week in concrete. Nobody else in the world could do three floors a week. I mean they were unbelievable. Trump Tower, other buildings.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Salerno was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/22/nyregion/reputed-mob-leader-among-15-indicted-on-racketeering-counts.html\">indicted</a> in 1986, the charges specifically mentioned Trump Plaza. Salerno&rsquo;s 1992 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/29/us/anthony-fat-tony-salerno-80-a-top-crime-boss-dies-in-prison.html\">obituary</a> ends with a nod to the luxury highrise and 15 other Manhattan buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump World Tower, <a href=\"https://business.highbeam.com/437515/article-1G1-194323735/delivering-concrete-nyc-quadrozzi-concrete-corp-has\">supported</a> by the Quadrozzi Concrete Company, is also tangentially related to La Cosa Nostra. The head of the company, John Quadrozzi Sr., was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/05/nyregion/big-concrete-supplier-faces-us-inquiry-into-possible-mob-tie.html?pagewanted=all\">tied</a> to the Lucchese crime family and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/12/nyregion/businessman-is-accused-of-mob-ties.html\">indicted</a> for making illegal payoffs to the mob in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,155417,00.html\"><em>TIME</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/29/the-kkk-and-mob-allegations-haunting-donald-trump.html\">Daily Beast</a>&nbsp;have speculated that Trump Tower was also built with mafia influence, though the evidence is less concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Atlantic City partnerships</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s alleged mob dealings were not confined to New York. According to reports from the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/28/donald-trump-rolling-snake-eyes_n_854177.html\">Huffington Post</a> &nbsp;and<em> <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1993-03-14/business/25952507_1_barry-shapiro-shopping-center-developer-organized-crime-family\">Philadelphia Inquirer</a></em>, Trump made a deal in Atlantic City with Kenneth Shapiro, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/ocbars2.pdf\">an associate of mob boss Nicky Scarfo</a>, and mob-connected labor boss <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1993-10-18/news/25938493_1_fbi-informant-anthony-tony-pro-provenzano-james-r-hoffa\">Daniel Sullivan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump seemed <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=VSyrCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=TrumpNation:+The+Art+of+Being+the+Donald&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjznc_VgKDLAhXIZCYKHWJcAeQQ6AEIHDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Dan%20Sullivan%20was%20the%20guy%20that%20killed%20Jimmy%20Hoffa%22&amp;f=false\">aware</a> of this, calling Shapiro &quot;a third-rate, local real estate mafia&quot; and Sullivan &quot;the guy who killed Jimmy Hoffa.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, in 1981, Trump leased a portion of the land for Trump Plaza and Casino from a company the two men controlled, according a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20121115053737/http://www.tdbimg.com/files/2011/05/26/-trump---barrett-book---supplemental-report-12-1992-6_165247103386.pdf\">report</a> by New Jersey gaming regulators. The company refused to cooperate with the authorities, and Trump eventually ended the partnership and bought out their shares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later Trump brought on Sullivan as a labor negotiator at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and introduced the man to his own banker, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-07/business/fi-27736_1_donald-trump/4\">according to the<em> Los Angeles Times</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through intermediaries&nbsp;Trump bought the property for the casino from the &quot;crown prince&quot; of the Philadelphia mob, Salvatore Testa, for $1.1 million in 1982. Multiple media reports and an unauthorized <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Trump-Deals-Downfall-Wayne-Barrett/dp/0060167041\">biography</a> about Trump allege this was more than twice its market value. (Testa purchased the property in 1977 for <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3GSXHR8ZL1HQ2dldWk4MVA5UG8/view?usp=sharing\">$195,000</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2015/07/28/how-close-was-donald-trump-to-the-mob/\">The Federalist</a></em>, two construction companies controlled by Nicky Scarfo ended up building Trump Plaza and Casino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You had contractors that were supposedly mob-oriented all over Atlantic City,&quot; Trump said when the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>asked him about it, adding that &quot;every single casino company used the same companies, just I hope you will say that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years later, Trump&rsquo;s organized crime connections extended overseas. In 1992, a Senate subcommittee <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/148449NCJRS.pdf\">named</a> Danny Leung, who was then the vice president for foreign marketing at Trump Taj Mahal, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Leung has also given complimentary tickets for hotel rooms and Asian shows to numerous members and associates of Asian organized crime,&quot; reads the report, which also identified three other triad-connected business associates or former employees of Trump&rsquo;s gambling empire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to gaming regulators, Leung &quot;flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than $1 million from the casino in a credit scam,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/trump-supports-casino-suspect-article-1.692948\">reported</a> the <em>New York Daily News</em> in 1995.&nbsp;&quot;The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leung, who had a separate contract to bring gamblers from Toronto to the casino, <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1997-03-06/news/25570112_1_casino-license-gaming-enforcement-atlantic-city\">denied</a> the affiliation to organized crime, and his casino and junket licenses were renewed. (The Trump Taj Mahal declared <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/\">bankruptcy</a> in 1991, and his other Atlantic City properties folded a decade later.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mob-linked business adviser</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there&rsquo;s&nbsp;Felix Sater, &quot;a twice-convicted Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; who served prison time and had documented mafia connections&quot; and the subject of the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/memory-lapse-trump-seeks-distance-advisor-past-ties/story?id=34600826\">ABC</a> story Cruz referenced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sater pleaded guilty to a charge of money laundering in 1998 and was indicted again in 2000 for taking part in a $40 million stock scheme involving four Mafia families, according to the<em> New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/nyregion/17trump.html?_r=0\">report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2003 to 2007, Sater traveled the country promoting projects for Trump, and his company was a partner in the Trump SoHo hotel. Trump told the <em>Times </em>he &quot;never knew that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years later, Sater returned to the Trump Organization and had business cards that described him as Trump&rsquo;s &quot;senior advisor,&quot; the AP <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/29c255c0b69a48258ecae69a61612537/trump-picked-stock-fraud-felon-senior-adviser\">reported</a>. Trump told the AP that he&rsquo;s &quot;not familiar&quot; with Sater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said, &quot;There have been multiple media reports about Donald&#39;s business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s important to note that these connections were not atypical in the real estate and casino businesses in the 1980s, Cruz&rsquo;s statement is accurate. Media reports have linked Trump to mafia bosses and mob-connected business associates for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-01T16:41:12.212457", "ruling_date": "2016-03-02T11:53:19", "ruling_headline": "Yes, Donald Trump has been linked to the mob", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-donald-trump-has-been-linked-mob", "ruling_link_text": "The Donald and the Dons", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NBC, <em>Meet the Press</em>, Feb. 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Brian Phillips, spokesperson for Ted Cruz, Feb. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/memory-lapse-trump-seeks-distance-advisor-past-ties/story?id=34600826\">Memory Lapse?
