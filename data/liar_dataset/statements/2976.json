Governor-elect Scott Walker, in the run-up to his inauguration, has gone so far as to <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/111463779.html\">suggest</a> stripping state employee unions of their rights to bargain contracts with the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnions -- for both public and private employers -- are also the target of <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Assembly&amp;district=63&amp;display=bio\">Robin Vos</a>, a Republican state representative from Rochester in Racine County. He is poised to become co-chair of the Legislature&rsquo;s powerful Joint Finance Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVos <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/111531154.html\">said</a> Dec. 8, 2010 he may introduce a bill to make Wisconsin a &quot;right-to-work&quot; state. As a freshman lawmaker, Walker supported right-to-work legislation in 1993.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a Dec. 12 <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/video/26107914/detail.html\">Milwaukee TV interview</a>, Vos touted the virtues of such a policy change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;From my perspective, I think that if you look at all of the data that has been collected,&quot; Vos said on WISN&rsquo;s &quot;Upfront with Mike Gousha,&quot; &quot;states that have non-forced, compulsory union membership when you want to work somewhere have higher rates of income growth, have higher rates of manufacturing -- actually, over time, have seen much greater increases in their standard of living.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to examine the question of whether right-to-work states are better off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll start by taking on the terminology.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA state is considered a &quot;right-to-work&quot; state if it prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that provide for a &quot;union shop.&quot; A union shop is a workplace in which all employees are required to pay union dues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA state that allows union shops is considered by unions to be a &quot;free-bargaining&quot; state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCurrently, 22 states, including Iowa in the Midwest, are right to work, according to a <a href=\"http://www.nrtw.org/rtws.htm\">map</a> provided by the <a href=\"http://www.nrtw.org/en/about\">National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation</a>, which says it defends America&rsquo;s workers &quot;from the abuses of compulsory unionism.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota are among 28 free-bargaining states, most of which are in the northeast quadrant of the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his TV interview, Vos made three claims about the benefits of right to work, but two are too vague for us to measure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVos said right-to-work states have a &quot;higher rate of manufacturing,&quot; which is not a common term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked to explain that claim, Vos provided one statistic about manufacturing gross domestic product and another about the loss of manufacturing jobs. A third statistic -- the percentage of a state&rsquo;s workforce employed in manufacturing -- was cited when we asked the <a href=\"http://www.wisaflcio.org/\">Wisconsin State AFL-CIO</a> union about &quot;rate of manufacturing.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVos also said right-to-work states have &quot;seen much greater increases in their standard of living.&quot; Vos himself defined &quot;standard of living&quot; with statistics on four different topics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re going to set aside both in this item and focus on the very measurable claim that right-to-work states have &quot;higher rates of income growth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVos provided four pieces of evidence, but only two addressed growth in income. Both came from the <a href=\"http://www.nilrr.org/\">National Institute for Labor Relations Research</a>, which advocates for right to work.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tA Rutgers University economics professor, in a <a href=\"http://www.nilrr.org/files/Freedom%20of%20Choice%20and%20Business%20Climates.pdf\">paper</a>written for the institute, said right-to-work laws &quot;are strongly correlated with faster growth&quot; in real personal income. The paper, however, was written in 2006 and did not provide data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe institute, using data from two federal agencies, <a href=\"http://www.nilrr.org/files/NILRR%20FACT%20SHEET%20RTW%20States%20Benefit%202010.pdf\">tracked</a>growth in real personal income from 1999 to 2009. It found the growth was 28.3 percent in right-to-work states and 14.7 percent in free-bargaining states.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a figure that supports Vos&rsquo; claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the national AFL-CIO used census data to examine median income from 2000 to 2009. <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/Copy+of+Income+Growth+Data+%283%29.xls\">Those </a><a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/Copy+of+Income+Growth+Data+%283%29.xls\">figures</a> show that income dropped 3 percent in right-to-work states and 5 percent in free-bargaining states. The union&rsquo;s figures adjusted for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat isn&rsquo;t income growth, which was what Vos pointed to; but the figures do come out in right-to-work&rsquo;s favor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s possible, of course, that changes in income may simply be correlated with a state having right-to-work status, and not caused by it. That is, there could be other factors at work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe consulted five economics professors on this point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey agreed that income growth has been higher in right-to-work states. But there was no consensus on how important right-to-work status is in causing that growth, and many minimized its role.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://business.marquette.edu/faculty/directory/abdur-chowdhury\">Abdur Chowdhury</a>, Marquette University: He said because factors such as business incentives and corporate tax rates are also involved, &quot;it would be a stretch to say&quot; right-to-work states had higher income growth because of right-to-work laws. With union representation less than 10 percent of private-sector employment nationally, he said, right to work &quot;is no longer as important as it used to be.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.be.wvu.edu/divecon/econ/sobel/\">Russell Sobel</a>, West Virginia University: He said it&rsquo;s unclear how right-to-work compares to other factors in causing income growth, but the amount of income growth in right-to-work states indicates the impact of right-to-work &quot;is fairly substantial.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.umsl.edu/divisions/artscience/economics/faculty/rogers.html\">William Rogers</a>, University of Missouri at St. Louis: &quot;There has been a lot of research on this topic, and the overall conclusion is that right-to-work laws may have a small positive impact on state income.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://academics.uww.edu/business/economics/faculty/kashian.htm\">Russell Kashian</a>, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater: Any right-to-work effect on income growth likely is diminishing, he said. Employers seeking low wages are more likely to go overseas, rather than choosing a right-to-work state over a free-bargaining state in the U.S.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/economics/vedder.html\">Richard Vedder</a>, Ohio University: Laws and regulations relating to taxes, the environment and other areas sometimes play a bigger role than right-to-work in income growth, he said. But right-to-work is an &quot;extremely simple and inexpensive policy change to implement.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a nutshell: None of the economists said right to work has no effect on raising income. But opinion is mixed on just how much of a factor it is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s punch the clock on this one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tArguing that Wisconsin would be better off economically if it became a right-to-work state, state Rep. Robin Vos claimed that income growth has been higher in right-to-work states than in free-bargaining states. He&rsquo;s correct on that statistic. But he leaves the impression that right-to-work status is what causes incomes to rise. As our interviews with economists show, that&rsquo;s debatable, at best. And that&rsquo;s important context left out of the statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(<strong>Note:</strong> Incorrect usage of &quot;closed shop&quot; was changed Dec. 17, 2010 to &quot;union shop.&quot;)</em></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-16T20:18:16.411020", "ruling_date": "2010-12-17T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Rep.
