Nicholas Scutari, a primary sponsor of the law, said he&rsquo;s glad Gov. Chris Christie decided to move forward with the program -- which, he said, is the most restrictive in the country by three measures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Certainly we&#39;re going to be the most restrictive state in the land &hellip; in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace,&quot; Scutari (D-Union) said during a July 27 NJToday interview. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs New Jersey really the most restrictive in those three categories?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost of the experts we spoke with said New Jersey definitely has one of the most -- if not the most -- restrictive medical marijuana programs overall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithin Scutari&rsquo;s three parameters, we found the state senator&rsquo;s statement sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWashington, D.C., and 16 states have medical marijuana laws. Maryland has a law, but it only allows medicinal marijuana use as a legal defense, so we aren&rsquo;t considering it. The District of Columbia isn&rsquo;t a state -- and Scutari said &quot;most restrictive state.&quot; So, while we&rsquo;ll look at Washington, D.C.&rsquo;s program, it won&rsquo;t factor into our final ruling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;ll compare New Jersey with other programs by Scutari&rsquo;s three measures -- who&rsquo;s eligible to get medical marijuana, how medical marijuana is recommended and how a patient actually gets it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe should note that medical marijuana technically can&rsquo;t be prescribed, but doctors can recommend it for patients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery state describes certain medical conditions or treatments that qualify a patient to receive medical marijuana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew Jersey&rsquo;s list of conditions is consistent with other states in some instances -- but of the 17 laws we are considering, only two -- New Jersey and Washington, D.C. -- don&rsquo;t have a provision for chronic pain, according to a breakdown of medical marijuana laws by the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the legalization of marijuana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTamar Todd, a staff attorney for Drug Policy Alliance, a drug policy reform organization, said while &quot;pain is one of the categories where it is most needed,&quot; it also is &quot;the category that allows the most abuse.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only mention of pain in New Jersey&rsquo;s law states that a patient with cancer or AIDS or who is HIV positive, qualifies for medical marijuana &quot;if severe or chronic pain, severe nausea or vomiting, cachexia, or wasting syndrome results from the condition or treatment thereof.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;[New Jersey&rsquo;s law] avoids some of the big loopholes that exist in some other states&rsquo; laws,&quot; like California and Colorado, said Jonathan Caulkins, professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetween New Jersey and Washington, D.C., the nation&rsquo;s capital has the more restrictive list of conditions, said Karen O&rsquo;Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, though D.C.&rsquo;s law also includes some medical treatments that New Jersey does not.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew Jersey, like most other states and Washington, D.C., allows other medical conditions to be added to the program.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, let&rsquo;s look at how a doctor can recommend medical marijuana for a patient and how a patient can get medical marijuana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew Jersey lists several requirements a physician must meet in order to be eligible to recommend medical marijuana. One example is a provision requiring doctors to register with the state health department. New Jersey&rsquo;s medical marijuana program is the only one in the country with that mandate, O&rsquo;Keefe said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce a doctor recommends in writing medical marijuana for someone in New Jersey, the patient or a caregiver must go to one of six dispensaries -- what the state calls &quot;alternative treatment centers.&quot; There is no provision allowing patients to grow marijuana at home in New Jersey, and patients can get a maximum amount of two ounces per month. Delaware -- which allows up to six ounces -- &nbsp;and D.C. -- which allows up to two ounces -- &nbsp;are the only other medical marijuana programs that don&rsquo;t have a grow-at-home provision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nO&rsquo;Keefe said, &quot;If you are talking about restrictive, I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to say that having dispensaries only is more restrictive,&quot; &nbsp;because marijuana is being grown in a controlled setting, rather than in private homes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nScutari said New Jersey will be the most restrictive state in the nation for medical marijuana because of who can get it, how a doctor can recommend it and how it is distributed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost experts we spoke with agreed New Jersey is one of the most restrictive states for medical marijuana overall. But by Scutari&rsquo;s three measures, PolitiFact New Jersey found that the Garden State is generally the most restrictive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, we rate Scutari&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/nj_medical_marijuana_law_is_re.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-11T18:55:04.950950", "ruling_date": "2011-08-14T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "State Sen.
