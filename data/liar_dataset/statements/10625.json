But one group that is widely seen as benefiting in recent years are investors in the stock market. This is a point that former Sen. James Webb, D-Va. -- a potential longshot candidate for president who&rsquo;s been taking an economic-populist approach -- made during an interview on ABC&rsquo;s <em>This Week</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the March 15, 2015, edition of the show, host George Stephanopoulos brought up a comment by Webb that &quot;powerful financial interests spending billions to elect people who think the current drift toward a permanent aristocracy is OK.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Webb explained his thinking this way:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;If you see what has been happening to our country over the past 20 or 25 years or so, with the economic model -- first, the model itself has broken apart. ... The employment model that was based on full-time employment, manufacturing-based, taking care of your working people, (it) fell apart a lot, when the manufacturing sector itself was hurt so bad in the past 20 years.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;But the other thing is &hellip; if you have capital, if you have assets, you&#39;re doing pretty well. The stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009. If you don&#39;t -- and this is particularly true right now with the generation that is coming into full adulthood -- they don&#39;t have that model anymore. They are doing part-time jobs, consultancy jobs, they&#39;ve got student loans to pay off.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Webb was right that &quot;the stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009.&quot; So we looked back at the historical data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, some background on the stock market. Companies that are publicly traded allow ownership shares to be sold on one of several stock exchanges. The values of a single share can rise or fall over time. Several different indexes are commonly used to measure the overall value of the market. We looked at four: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is a smaller group of blue-chip stocks; the Standard &amp; Poors 500, which offers a larger and broader mix of stocks; the NASDAQ Composite, which includes a lot of fast-growing technology stocks; and the Wilshire 5000, which includes the broadest list of publicly traded companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following table summarizes the growth of these three measurements between April 1, 2009, and today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none; width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Measure</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">April 1, 2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">March 16, 2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Increase (multiple)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Dow Jones Industrial Average</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">7,762</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">17,977</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">2.3 times higher</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Standard &amp; Poors 500</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">811</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">2,081</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">2.6 times higher</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>NASDAQ Composite</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">1,552</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">4,930</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">3.2 times higher</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Wilshire 5000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">8242</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">21949</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">2.7 times higher</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>These numbers show that Webb is definitely right for the NASDAQ Composite (in fact, he underestimates a bit) and that he&rsquo;s just about on target for the S&amp;P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 if you round the figures upwards. Webb&rsquo;s claim that the stock market &quot;almost tripled&quot; overshoots the increase for the Dow, which is 2.3 times higher now than in April 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University&rsquo;s Stern School of Business, warned that comparisons like Webb&rsquo;s are sensitive to the choice of start and end dates, among other issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For example, if one takes the Dow Jones Industrial Average and instead makes the comparison with its previous high in 2007, the increase is only 25 percent -- not the more-than doubling that occurred from its low point in 2009,&quot; he said. &quot;And if one nets out inflation from that 25 percent increase, the &#39;real&#39; increase in the stock market has been only about half of that increase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Webb said that &quot;the stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009.&quot; There are different ways to measure &quot;the stock market.&quot; For three of the four most common yardsticks, Webb is basically right; for the other one, he&rsquo;s off base, but not dramatically so. And it&#39;s worth noting that the period Webb chose maximizes the increase; a longer time horizon makes the gain more modest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-17T12:23:03.692902", "ruling_date": "2015-03-17T16:13:24", "ruling_headline": "James Webb says stock market has tripled in value since 2009", "ruling_headline_slug": "james-webb-says-stock-market-has-tripled-value-200", "ruling_link_text": "If you have a 401k, you'll feel richer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>James Webb, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/sen-jim-webb-eyes-2016-29651471\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>comments</u></a> on ABC&rsquo;s <em>This Week</em>, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4642645?4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>March 15, 2015</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yahoo!
