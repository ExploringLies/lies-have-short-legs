Lamontagne said. &quot;&quot;The decision about whether or not to have kindergarten is a decision for the communities and school districts of our state, it is not<br />\r\n\tsomething that should be compelled, it&#39;s really not something that should be compelled by the state. &hellip; If you turnover that decision to the state, what other decisions are you going to turn over to the state -- or worse to the federal government?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPress secretary for the state Democratic Party Collin Gately provided us additional back-up including endorsements from <a href=\"http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/opinion/editorials/981366-465/maggie-hassan-for-governor.html\">The Telegraph </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/2575106-95/hassan-lamontagne-hampshire-state\">Concord Monitor </a>for Lamontagne&rsquo;s opponent, Maggie Hassan and a Telegraph <a href=\"http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/977131-469/hassan-lamontange-square-off-at-rivier-college.html\">story </a>about a Lamontagne-Hassan debate at Rivier University, quoting Lamontagne: &quot;I support public kindergarten but those decisions should be made by parents and citizens at the local level, not mandated from Concord. Maggie thinks it should be mandated from Concord.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLamontagne spokesman Tom Cronin told PolitiFact New Hampshire that Lamontagne, a former schoolteacher, has &quot;no intention of trying to overturn the kindergarten mandate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He opposed the original kindergarten mandate years ago because he believed it was the prerogative of local school districts to decided whether or not to offer and fund public kindergarten,&quot; Cronin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf elected governor, Lamontagne could face whether to sign or veto a bill to repeal the state mandating kindergarten. During the 2011, session, state Rep. Jonathan Maltz, R-Hudson, proposed <a href=\"http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_Status/bill_status.aspx?lsr=806&amp;sy=2011&amp;sortoption=&amp;txtsessionyear=2011&amp;txtbillnumber=hb631\">H.B. 631 </a>to repeal the state mandate requiring districts to provide kindergarten programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill specifically addressed repealing <a href=\"http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2008/SB0530.html\">SB 530</a>, which provides kindergarten construction grants for districts that do not currently operate kindergarten programs, until every district in the state has a kindergarten program, according to Stephanie Rose, an Associate Policy Analyst with the Education Commission of the States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Maltz&rsquo;s bill <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/16/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-democrats-heap-blame-speaker-bill-obrien-and-hi/\">didn&rsquo;t gain much traction </a>from House Democrats or Republicans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(It&rsquo;s worth noting, that some New Hampshire legislators oppose the mandate so vehemently they tried to <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2012/07/06/does-kindergarten-lead-to-crime-fact-checking-n-h-legislators-research/\">correlate </a>higher crime rates with towns that offer kindergarten).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s still the question of whether repealing the state mandate would mean the elimination kindergarten for New Hampshire families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot quite, history tells us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor decades, New Hampshire was the only state in the country that didn&rsquo;t require schools to offer public kindergarten. Even so, <a href=\"http://www.redorbit.com/news/education/1088567/pelham_officials_question_mandatory_kindergarten/\">140 New Hampshire towns</a>-- more than 90 percent of New Hampshire districts -- already offered free public kindergarten.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNashua, the second largest district in the state -- and where the Democrats&rsquo; flyer was mailed -- was one of the communities to offer kindergarten without being required to.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If the state were to repeal the kindergarten mandate I can tell you we would not be looking to eliminate that grade level,&quot; Nashua Superintendent Mark Conrad said. &quot;I think it&rsquo;s well-recognized as an essential part of the public school system throughout the United States.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.education.nh.gov/data/documents/no_kinder06_07.pdf\">About a dozen </a>districts, representing about 1,500 children, did not offer public kindergarten, until fall 2009, which is when the state officially required kindergarten to be part of an &quot;adequate education.&quot; Those children either went to private kindergarten, to out-of-district schools or stayed home.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the mandate was lifted, so could the number of public kindergarten programs in the state. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I also think it would be fair to say, without the mandate, over time, you might find some communities dropping (kindergarten) as they&rsquo;re pressed for costs that we&#39;re all facing in these tough economic times,&quot; Conrad added.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA dramatized New Hampshire Democratic Party flyer tries to make Lamontagne out as a kindergarten abolisher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLamontagne acknowledges he opposed state-mandated public kindergarten -- and still doesn&rsquo;t agree with it. But he has no plans to repeal it, which is a far cry from eliminating an entire school grade from public schools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo say repealing the law would &quot;eliminate kindergarten&quot; and put a generation of New Hampshire students &quot;one year behind&quot; is over the top. But doing so would likely impact the families who can&rsquo;t afford to send their children to private or out-of-district schools for kindergarten.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-03T11:06:31.716971", "ruling_date": "2012-11-03T11:05:01", "ruling_headline": "Does Ovide Lamontagne want to get rid of kindergarten?
