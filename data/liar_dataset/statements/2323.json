Candidate Michael Gardiner singled out the high cost of fighting in Afghanistan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place. Really,&quot; he said. &quot;So we really need to lower our expectations there and save the lives and save the war costs and bring that money home to rebuild America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThirty seconds later, he repeated that assertion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did a quick Google search, hoping to find the source of that number, and drew a blank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we called Gardiner. He said he came across it while surfing the Internet. &quot;I&#39;m looking for information constantly.&quot; But he didn&#39;t remember where he saw it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Because of the location, I guess it&#39;s landlocked in central Asia, it cost three times more to fight there than it does in Iraq. I said anywhere else. I was being a little bit loose. Specifically it&#39;s three times more to fight there than in Iraq. It&#39;s probably because you have to fly everything in.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe subsequently sent us <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2010-05-12-afghan_N.htm\" id=\"w.-o\" title=\"a USA Today article\">a USA Today article</a> from May 13 noting that in February, the Pentagon was spending $6.7 billion per month in Afghanistan compared with $5.5 billion in Iraq. &quot;As recently as fiscal year 2008, Iraq was three times as expensive; in 2009 it was twice as costly,&quot; according to the article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article also noted that the &quot;costs per service member in Afghanistan have been roughly double what they were in Iraq since 2005,&quot; because of its landlocked location, less-reliable security, high cost of fuel and its lack of infrastructure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found another source: a July 16, 2010 report on &quot;<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf\" id=\"ic-l\" title=\"The Cost of Iraq, Afghanista, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11\">The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11</a>&quot; from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm for Congress. It contained a breakdown of how much has been spent in Iraq and Afghanistan since Sept. 11, 2001, along with a monthly count of how many military personnel (described as &quot;boots on the ground&quot;) in each country each month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe took the September spending numbers for each year and each war and calculated the approximate cost per service member. Over the life of the Afghanistan war, the cost through September comes out to roughly $1.26 million per person. The average is $758,000 per person in Iraq.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it has cost, on a per-service member basis, about two thirds more to fight in Afghanistan than in Iraq.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Gardiner&#39;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-02T13:24:34.975125", "ruling_date": "2010-09-07T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Gardiner says war costs in Afghanistan are triple \"any other place\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "gardiner-says-war-costs-afghanistan-are-triple-any", "ruling_link_text": "Not even double", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tChannel 6 debate, <a href=\"http://ww.abc6.com/Global/story.asp?S=13070286\">Republican candidates for 2nd Congressional District</a>, Aug. 30, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Michael Gardiner, Aug. 31, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUSAToday.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2010-05-12-afghan_N.htm\" id=\"z:kl\" title=\"Afghan war costs now outpace Iraq's\">Afghan war costs now outpace Iraq&#39;s</a>,&quot; May 13, 2010, accessed Aug. 31, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf\" id=\"n23x\" title=\"The Cost of Iraq, Afghanista, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11\">The Cost of Iraq, Afghanista, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11</a>,&quot; July 16, 2010, accessed Aug. 31, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Lawyer", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Michael J.", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Rhode Island", "id": 474, "last_name": "Gardiner", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-j-gardiner", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/michael_gardiner80.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Rhode Island", "edition": "Rhode Island", "edition_slug": "rhode-island", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 6, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Rhode Island Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/6/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/474/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.gardinerforcongress.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;It costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Rhode Island News Channel debate", "statement_date": "2010-08-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 113, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/113/", "subject": "Afghanistan", "subject_slug": "afghanistan", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 1, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/1/", "subject": "Iraq", "subject_slug": "iraq", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
