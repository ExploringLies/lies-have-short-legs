The two are competing to represent the 7th Congressional District, which includes eastern Sacramento County and the cities of Folsom, Rancho Cordova and Elk Grove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones, who has a law degree, has done more than just personally deny the claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.capradio.org/articles/2016/10/06/ami-bera-and-scott-jones-both-faced-controvesy-during-campaigns/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje9deF_NrPAhVkwlQKHf6oBlwQFggHMAE&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2asy8Ol-5K1L1vRTVNQnWz7Kylg\">August interview</a> with Capital Public Radio, Jones said two judges had determined the allegations have no merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These allegations that supposedly happened 13 years ago, but were never brought up until in this lawsuit a year or so ago, were found by two separate judges to not have merit,&quot; Jones said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News coverage of the case indicates the claims about sexual misconduct never advanced to trial for procedural reasons, which is far different than Jones&rsquo; assertion that they were evaluated and found to have no merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact-check whether any judges found the claims against Jones have &quot;no merit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Claim part of larger lawsuit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The accusations about sexual advances are from Tosca Olives, who, beginning as a young sheriff&rsquo;s deputy, said she had about 30 inappropriate encounters with Jones between 2003 and 2005. Her claims were inserted into a larger lawsuit brought against the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department by four deputies alleging workplace retaliation, sexual harassment and sexual discrimination by their supervisors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only the retaliation claim advanced to trial. A jury sided with the deputies on that charge and awarded them nearly $3.6 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the trial started, deputies used Olives&rsquo; subpoenaed testimony to support their claims of a hostile work environment based on sexual favoritism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacramento Superior Court Judge David I. Brown, however, did not allow the sexual harassment and favoritism claims, including Olives&rsquo; supporting testimony, to advance. He did not because the deputies &quot;failed to initially plead the cause of action or raise it with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing,&quot; according to a <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article94905647.html\">Sacramento Bee fact check</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bee examined a nearly identical claim from Jones, made in a prepared statement in July, that a judge had found Olives&rsquo; allegations have no merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It labeled Jones&rsquo; claim false and described it as &quot;misleading.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nothing in the court record indicates the judge passed judgment on the merits of Olives&rsquo; accusations,&quot; the Bee fact check said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jones&rsquo; response</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the Jones campaign to explain the candidate&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kyle Macdonald, Jones&rsquo; campaign manager, noted that Judge Brown dismissed the charges tied to the Olives testimony before trial. He said in an email that decision &quot;can lead a reasonable person to conclude that the Judge found insufficient merit in them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the trial started, Macdonald said a second superior court judge, David DeAlba, ruled Olives could not testify. He described this decision &quot;as close as Sheriff Jones can get to an exoneration in this format.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Macdonald added: &quot;In sum, no Judge did - or would ever - say &lsquo;I find no merit to these allegations,&rsquo; but each of the Judge&#39;s rulings in that regard is as close as it would get, and can reasonably be taken with that meaning.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Bera campaign spokeswoman responded to Jones&rsquo; claim saying: &quot;Not advancing to trial is distinct from being dismissed by a judge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones recently claimed that allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a young, female sheriff&rsquo;s deputy &quot;were found by two separate judges to not have merit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News coverage, including a Sacramento Bee fact check, found the allegations by the deputy never advanced to trial for procedural reasons. It also found there&rsquo;s no evidence in the court record that a judgement was made on the merits of the claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for the Jones campaign acknowledged that no judge has ever stated in court that the claims had no merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without any evidence to point to, Jones and his campaign ask the public to make a leap of faith about the candidate&rsquo;s claim, and interpret what the judges might have been thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t make that assumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Jones&rsquo; statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">more</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/df361b33-c638-481c-9e11-a3976a2bce3a\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/df361b33-c638-481c-9e11-a3976a2bce3a</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-13T20:13:27.046062", "ruling_date": "2016-10-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Jones falsely claims judges ruled on allegations of unwanted sexual advances", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-jones-falsely-claims-judges-ruled-allegation", "ruling_link_text": "No evidence backing up Jones' claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Capital Public Radio, <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/articles/2016/10/06/ami-bera-and-scott-jones-both-faced-controvesy-during-campaigns/\">Part 2: Bera And Jones On Court Cases, Campaign Finance, Presidential Candidates</a>, Oct. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacramento Superior Court, Declaration - IN SUPPORT OF DAVID P.E.
