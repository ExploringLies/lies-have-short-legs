Dana Young, R-Tampa, has sent mailers touting her vote for a recent bill targeting fracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effects of the legislation Young voted for are not as clear cut as the claim Young makes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third-party group supporting Young, who is facing Democrat Bob Buesing for state Senate in the newly created District 18, sent the&nbsp;mailer in the last weeks of September that says she &quot;voted for a statewide fracking ban to protect our water.&quot; The group, the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, paid for the mailpiece, but the mailer says that Young approved the message. So we are putting Young on the Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X7pVDyBINvFAxRAeUGQhbfcdk9W6XeRgmwLz3g5HoHJ-gIuBfTW5IiOkpPjpsrZi6zlmC8o9TpjPA3-Ltx2crdaseCyk9Um6l_FLdTlKBV-c8Hy0SJ5AwO_4eA91W1xLmRovftw7\" style=\"border:none; height:585px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mailer refers to Young&rsquo;s vote on <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2016/0191/Category\">House Bill 191</a>, legislation aimed at regulating fracking in Florida. We were curious about the Young&rsquo;s statement and the specifics of the measure.&nbsp;As we looked further into the bill, we found the mailer is somewhat misleading. What Young voted for would have regulated fracking, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have permanently banned it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A closer look at House Bill 191</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HB 191, dubbed &quot;Regulation of Oil and Gas Resources,&quot; was sponsored by Rep. Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, and passed 73 to 45 on Jan. 27 in the Florida House.&nbsp;Young voted in favor of this bill, along with 72 other Republicans, while 38 Democrats and 7 Republicans opposed the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young reasoned that HB 191 could have been the first step to a permanent ban on fracking. However, the bill only called for a temporary moratorium on the process, not a &quot;ban&quot; like her mailer says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats who voted against the bill echoed arguments of environmental groups and said a temporary ban doesn&rsquo;t go far enough to protect Florida&rsquo;s water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had the bill passed (it<a href=\"http://www.newsherald.com/news/20160301/fracking-bill-falls-in-florida-legislature\"> was defeated in a Florida Senate committee</a>), the measure would have allowed Florida to regulate fracking &mdash; a process that involves pumping large amounts of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to harness oil and gas reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Per the bill, fracking permits would not have been issued until a study was completed in 2017 by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP would have proposed rules based on the study&rsquo;s results, which would have been subject to approval of the Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Point being, the bill was never intended to ban fracking permanently, but place a moratorium on the practice while its effects were studied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats also took issue with the fact the bill would have prohibited Florida&#39;s counties and cities from passing local bans against fracking. According to the <em><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article56938703.html\">Miami Herald</a></em>, 41 cities and 27 counties oppose fracking. St. Petersburg has passed a resolution against hydraulic fracturing, along with Broward County, which <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-broward-anti-fracking-20160125-story.html\">outlawed fracking in January</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, there were several amendments to HB191 offered up by Democrats that would have created more safeguards against fracking, including a<a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=614939.docx&amp;DocumentType=Amendments&amp;BillNumber=0191&amp;Session=2016\"> restriction on what chemicals can be used</a> and studies on <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=614939.docx&amp;DocumentType=Amendments&amp;BillNumber=0191&amp;Session=2016\">prenatal health</a>, but they didn&rsquo;t pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young voted against some of these, but her spokesperson said those issues were unnecessary, trusting the DEP study would have addressed those concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young&rsquo;s office said she strongly opposes fracking in Florida and will continue to seek a statewide ban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mailer from Young says she &quot;voted for a statewide ban on fracking.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That vote is in reference to HB&nbsp;191, which would have set up a temporary moratorium on fracking in anticipation of future regulations. The bill would have authorized a study on which to base further regulation. It was not an outright ban on fracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young&rsquo;s claim is partially accurate but is missing context that would give the reader a different impression. For that reason, we rate Young&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Correction: </strong>A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly reported who sent the mailer. The piece has been updated to reflect that it was sent by an outside committee with Young&#39;s approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ed07ec3c-17f2-456c-aded-b343caaff2b7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ed07ec3c-17f2-456c-aded-b343caaff2b7</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-03T16:26:36.968879", "ruling_date": "2016-10-05T17:03:32", "ruling_headline": "Dana Young mailer leaves out context of fracking bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "dana-young-mailer-leaves-out-context-fracking-bill", "ruling_link_text": "Only a moratorium", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Jonathan Webber, deputy director of Florida Conservation Voters, Sept.30 -Oct. 3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, &nbsp;Marc Reichelderfer, campaign general consultant, Sept. 29-Oct.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Kelsey Swithers, Senior Communications Consultant, Sept. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Rep.
