Andrew Bednall. Case records show Bednall&rsquo;s ex-wife had objected to Bradley representing Bednall. The court-appointed attorney for their son also expressed&nbsp;concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ethics rules prevent lawyers from having sexual relationships with clients. However, they do not prevent lawyers from representing clients if a romantic relationship existed prior to the attorney-client relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bradley responded in court papers filed in 2005. She said she and Bednall previously had a romantic relationship that &quot;we both believed might result in marriage.&quot; She wrote that that part of the relationship ended in November 2002, but that they continued to date &quot;on a nonexclusive basis&quot; at the time of the custody case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The judge on the case declined to remove Bradley from the case on ethical grounds, according to the public filings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bradley&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our requests to back the statement we&rsquo;re checking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Family law experts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked with five lawyers, four from the Milwaukee area and one from Madison, who have more than 100 years of combined experience in family law cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retired Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Lee Wells, who headed the family law division for eight years and still handles family cases as a reserve judge and mediator, said he has seen non-family law attorneys handle family cases and has seen lawyers in family cases represent someone they had or were having a relationship with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he said he couldn&rsquo;t characterize how common it is, partly because there likely were instances where lawyers didn&rsquo;t disclose their lack of family law experience, or didn&rsquo;t disclose that they were representing someone they had been involved with romantically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other four lawyers, however, said that in their decades of experience, they could not recall even one case like Bradley&rsquo;s, in which a lawyer represents a former boyfriend in a contested family law case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bradley says her representation of an ex-boyfriend &quot;who was then my friend&quot; in a family law case is &quot;something that lawyers do on a regular basis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we found no evidence of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four of five longtime family law lawyers told us such representation is not done regularly -- they had never seen a lawyer represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case. The other expert said he could recall cases similar to Bradley&rsquo;s, but couldn&rsquo;t say whether they occurred on a regular basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Bradley&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-25T11:16:45.339425", "ruling_date": "2016-03-25T11:41:34", "ruling_headline": "Testing Rebecca Bradley claim that lawyers 'on a regular basis' do what she did in family law case", "ruling_headline_slug": "justice-rebecca-bradley-says-lawyers-regular-basis", "ruling_link_text": "Available evidence indicates it's rare", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Public Radio, Rebecca Bradley <a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/listen/899116\">interview</a> (6:50), March 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/bradley-extra-marital-affair-role-in-child-placement-surface-b99684605z1-371700831.html\">&quot;Bradley extramarital affair, role in child placement surface,&quot;</a> March 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, retired family law lawyer and 18-year family court commissioner Lucy Cooper, March 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, 31-year Milwaukee family law lawyer Gregg Herman, March 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, family law lawyer and former eight-year Milwaukee County Circuit Court family law division chief Judge Lee Wells, March 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, 31-year Milwaukee family law lawyer <a href=\"http://familylawwi.com/wisconsin-family-law-attorneys/martin-gagne-milwaukee-family-law-attorney/\">Martin Gagne</a>, March 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, 23-year Madison family law lawyer <a href=\"http://www.boardmanclark.com/bios/marta-meyers-family-law-attorney/\">Marta Meyers</a>, March 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, JoAnne Kloppenburg campaign manager Melissa Mulliken, March 23, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Rebecca", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3441, "last_name": "Bradley", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "rebecca-bradley", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rebecca_Bradley_Pfact.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3441/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says her representation of an ex-boyfriend &quot;who was then my friend&quot; in a family law case is &quot;something that lawyers do on a regular basis.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio interview", "statement_date": "2016-03-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 35, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/35/", "subject": "Ethics", "subject_slug": "ethics", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 119, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/119/", "subject": "Families", "subject_slug": "families", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
