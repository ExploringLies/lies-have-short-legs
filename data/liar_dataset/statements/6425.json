So we took our own look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe health care law took effect in 2010, and taxes began then to support the measure. Key &nbsp;parts of the bill don&rsquo;t kick in until 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-adds-trillions-deficit/\">an item about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney</a>, PolitiFact National noted that the 10-year aspect of the claim was correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe item read, in part:: &quot;The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years. And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/22027\"> increased</a> the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat estimate was updated in July 2012, when the CBO said the law would cost $84 billion less than it had previously predicted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Jan. 6, 2011, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virg., made virtually the same claim as Hovde, saying the law &quot;offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases&quot; and it was Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/jan/15/eric-cantor/cantor-says-health-care-reform-collects-1o-years-t/\">PolitiFact Virginia noted</a>: &quot;Cantor&rsquo;s argument that the &lsquo;benefits&rsquo; don&rsquo;t kick in until 2014 is true if you&rsquo;re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect.&quot; Those include small business tax credits, coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, assistance for early retirees and coverage for dependents until they&rsquo;re age 26. Also, not all of the taxes kicked in immediately.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn March 1, 2011, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said the law has &quot;six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/mar/07/ken-cuccinelli/ken-cuccinelli-says-health-care-law-has-six-years-/\">PolitiFact Virginia also rated </a>Cuccinelli&rsquo;s claim Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost,&quot; it wrote. &quot;But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, yes, the taxing began in 2010, and key parts of it don&rsquo;t kick in until 2014. But, like so many claims, it&rsquo;s not as simple as that. Some benefits already kicked in, and some of the taxes don&rsquo;t take effect until later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde repeats a claim that&rsquo;s been a routine part of the GOP attack on Obamacare: that there are 10 years of taxes charged for six years of benefits. It&rsquo;s true that the tax money began to come in starting in 2010. But it&rsquo;s false that the benefits don&rsquo;t kick in until 2014. There are numerous parts of the bill that have already taken effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde joins the crowd who have made the same claim. It&rsquo;s Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-08T18:15:18.514569", "ruling_date": "2012-08-08T18:30:53", "ruling_headline": "GOP candidate for US Senate Hovde claims Obamacare levies 10 years of taxes for 6 years of benefits", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-candidate-us-senate-hovde-claims-obamacare-lev", "ruling_link_text": "Old claim repeated, warts and all", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWISN-TV <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/Hovde-claims-lead-in-Senate-race/-/9374034/15816396/-/14kyrs7z/-/index.html\">&quot;Upfront with Mike Gousha,&quot;, July 29, 2012</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/health/policy/3-million-more-may-lack-insurance-due-to-ruling-study-says.html?_r=1\">&quot;Medicaid expansion ruling may blunt reach of health law,&quot;</a>July 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-claims-health-care-law-accelerating-/\">&quot;Rep.
