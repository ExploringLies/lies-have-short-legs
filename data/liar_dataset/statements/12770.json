And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States. So, don&#39;t let anyone ever tell you that this country isn&#39;t great, that somehow we need to make it great again, because this right now is the greatest country on Earth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have previously checked whether the building at the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the U.S. Capitol, was built by slaves.

The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states -- Virginia and Maryland -- ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American(s) &mdash; enslaved and free &mdash; to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stonemason, Collen Williamson, &quot;trained enslaved people on the spot at the government&#39;s quarry at Aquia, Va.,&quot; the group wrote. &quot;Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the president&#39;s house. The slaves joined a workforce that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rMbYL-1Rt51LPN5Lr-r8iLLPiTfw70lTX_KeIwLoj2GunSJepKMxmod4ESaBfpklBXFSWxCV-yIY_thkEa5ARO1lXTze-Yj7lFMJ7NHkdUvPklgcTYuKFojnJUeLIOzePSErxujL\" style=\"border:none; height:384px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>These payroll records show that the government did not own slaves, but that it did hire them.

But slaves were significantly involved in the construction of the White House, so we have no quarrel with the way Obama worded her claim.
