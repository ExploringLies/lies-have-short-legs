He then laid out some rather unflattering and harsh comparisons:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fifteen neighborhoods in Baltimore have lower life expectancies than North Korea. Two of them have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank in Palestine. Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. We are talking about the United States of America in the year 2016 &mdash; a country in which <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/sep/21/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-top-01-us-have-almost-much-wea/\">the top 1/10th of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it would be wrong to take Sanders&rsquo; claim to mean that conditions overall are worse than Baltimore, we found that his specific comparisons are largely accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The comparisons fairly make the point that there are some parts of this rich country where conditions resemble those in much poorer countries,&quot; said Alan Berube, an expert on urban poverty at the Brookings Institution. &quot;This isn&#39;t isolated to Baltimore; there are neighborhoods in nearly every big U.S. city and metropolitan area, and many rural communities, that perform just as poorly on these outcomes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take Sanders&rsquo; claims one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Life expectancy in North Korea</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sanders campaign referred us to a <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/30/baltimores-poorest-residents-die-20-years-earlier-than-its-richest/\">article</a> noting that 14 Baltimore neighborhoods had shorter life expectancies than North Korea in 2013. (The article originally said 15 but was corrected.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His number is slightly outdated. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, the latest year where there&rsquo;s data on both places, the average life expectancy in North Korea was 69.81 years, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150814201631/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html\">according to the CIA World Factbook</a>. That placed the impoverished dictatorship at No. 155 in longest lifespans out of 224 countries. The United States overall ranked at No. 42 with 79.56 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Residents in <a href=\"http://bniajfi.org/indicators/Children%20and%20Family%20Health/LifeExp/\">12 of Baltimore&#39;s 56 neighborhoods</a> lived shorter lives, according to data from the Baltimore City Health Department provided to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. That&rsquo;s not 15, but it&rsquo;s close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(For context, just five Baltimore neighborhoods have life expectancies higher than the U.S.&nbsp;national average, and four of them are <a href=\"http://bniajfi.org/community/Cross-Country_Cheswolde/\">relatively</a> <a href=\"http://bniajfi.org/community/North%20Baltimore_Guilford_Homeland/\">affluent</a> <a href=\"http://bniajfi.org/community/Mount%20Washington_Coldspring/\">and</a> <a href=\"http://bniajfi.org/community/Glen-Fallstaff/\">white</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a map from the University of Maryland&rsquo;s Capital News Service that compares the life expectancies of Baltimore neighborhoods in 2013 to other places in the world:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://smussenden.cartodb.com/viz/7978b784-bb8e-11e5-b8c3-0e31c9be1b51/embed_map?zoom=12&amp;center_lat=39.329932&amp;center_lon=-76.623511\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important caveat: The city of Baltimore has a total population around 600,000 people while North Korea has a population 40 times that. That means fewer events in Baltimore neighborhood could swing the overall life expectancy of a neighborhood up or down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Infant mortality in the West Bank</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this claim, the Sanders campaign referred us to a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/5/4/8541369/infant-mortality-baltimore\">Vox article</a> that said two neighborhoods in Baltimore &mdash; Little Italy and Greenmount East &mdash; had a higher rate of infant mortality than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in his speech, Sanders only mentioned the West Bank. In 2014, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150428041451/https://www.cia.gov/library//publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html\">13.49 out of 1,000 babies</a> died before their first birthday in the notorious conflict zone, according to the CIA&rsquo;s World Factbook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The West Bank places in the middle of the pack in infant mortality at No. 117 out of 224 countries. The United States, meanwhile, ranked at No. 169 with a rate of 6.17 deaths per 1,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://bniajfi.org/indicators/Children%20and%20Family%20Health/mort1/\">11 Baltimore neighborhoods</a> had a higher rate than the West Bank. In Hilltop and Little Italy, at least 20 out of 1,000 infants died before their first birthday. That&rsquo;s not only higher than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela but also war-torn Syria and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/uzbekistan\">oppressive</a> Uzbekistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Teen health in distressed cities in developing countries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders claimed that &quot;Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sanders campaign cited a <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/30/heres-one-way-baltimore-teens-are-worse-off-than-poor-youths-in-nigeria-and-india/\">article</a> by Johns Hopkins University researchers.&nbsp;&quot;Teenagers in Baltimore face poorer health and more negative outlooks than those in urban centers of Nigeria, India and China,&quot; they write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to what Sanders said, the work by the&nbsp;Johns Hopkins researchers&nbsp;don&rsquo;t consider economic outlooks nor do they show Baltimore conditions being worse than South Africa&rsquo;s. Nonetheless, his broader point is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers published a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jahonline.org/issue/S1054-139X(14)X0003-0\">comprehensive set of studies</a> published in the<em> Journal of Adolescent Health </em>in 2014 that&nbsp;compared the well-being of teens in impoverished areas in Baltimore; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; New Delhi, India; and Shanghai, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baltimore teens reported the highest rates <a href=\"http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00332-2/pdf\">pregnancy</a> and, after Johannesburg, the second highest rates of <a href=\"http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00356-5/pdf\">substance use</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00354-1/pdf\">sexual and physical violence</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(14)00355-3/pdf\">feeling unsafe in their community</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZDf48qyX1llITlpuL_LxUOhG0FA14yW05n-EtUzGnk/pubchart?oid=1915736238&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders presented a series of comparisons showing that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rivaled that of &quot;the West Bank in Palestine,&quot; &quot;North Korea,&quot; and &quot;distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of Sanders&rsquo; figures need to be updated, but the gist of his specific comparisons are accurate: 12 Baltimore neighborhoods have a lower life expectancy than North Korea; 11 have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank; and research shows health conditions are worse for poor teens than in Baltimore than in Ibadan, New Delhi and Shanghai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525deb4c-b6b0-41fb-bfa0-ffb25203ddcc\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525deb4c-b6b0-41fb-bfa0-ffb25203ddcc</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-28T10:52:56.468379", "ruling_date": "2016-04-28T17:06:34", "ruling_headline": "Bernie Sanders says conditions in Baltimore no better than North Korea, West Bank", "ruling_headline_slug": "bernie-sanders-says-conditions-baltimore-no-better", "ruling_link_text": "The developing world of Bmore", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Real Clear Politics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/24/bernie_sanders_in_baltimore_poverty_is_a_death_sentence_similar_to_palestine_or_north_korea.html\">Bernie Sanders: In Baltimore &quot;Poverty Is A Death Sentence,&quot;
