Marco Rubio&nbsp;took aim at one provision of a gun law&nbsp;passed in New York state that he suggests can be easily circumvented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Republican posted a photo of two semi-automatic rifles. Both rifles almost look the same. But one has a pistol grip attached, so it is not legal in New York state, Rubio said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Under N.Y. State &lsquo;Assault Weapon&rsquo; ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal &amp; banned,&quot; Rubio&rsquo;s tweet read.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweet came as Rubio&rsquo;s response to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said earlier in the day that Rubio &quot;should be ashamed of&quot; himself for not supporting stricter gun control legislation. During a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/politics/marco-rubio-cnn-town-hall/index.html\">CNN town hall</a> the night before, Rubio signaled support for raising the age to buy a rifle or shotgun to 21 and for tighter background checks for gun purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo supports tougher gun-control measures, like universal background checks and a ban on military-style accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state already has a ban on some of those accessories. We wanted to know if the one on Rubio&rsquo;s tweet is on that list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New York state gun laws</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The accessory shown in the image, called a pistol grip, has been banned on rifles in New York state since 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s one of several <a href=\"https://safeact.ny.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/RiflesBannedFeatures.pdf\">features</a> banned by the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, better known as the SAFE Act. The law, spearheaded by Cuomo, was passed a few weeks after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law banned so-called assault weapons&nbsp;and created a legal definition for them in New York state. The law defined them broadly as semi-automatic firearms with one or more of the features also banned by the law. There are <a href=\"https://safeact.ny.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/RiflesBannedFeatures.pdf\">10</a> of those features for rifles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weapon used by Adam Lanza, the shooter at Sandy Hook, is banned under state law, for example. Lanza used a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip and a flash suppressor &mdash; two of the features banned under the SAFE Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the rifle without a pistol grip pictured in Rubio&rsquo;s tweet would also be subject to other gun regulations in New York state. First, anyone who wanted to buy the rifle in New York state would have to go through a background check, regardless of who they buy it from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State law would also prohibit any gun owner from attaching a magazine to the rifle that holds more than 10 rounds. Only <a href=\"http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/hardware-ammunition/large-capacity-magazines/#state\">seven</a> other states have laws that ban large capacity magazines. Florida, where a shooter killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School this month, is not one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said with a photo on Twitter that &quot;1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal &amp; banned&quot; in New York state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;The pistol grip shown is one of the banned features for rifles under New York state&#39;s SAFE Act.&nbsp;The rifle would also be subject to other New York state regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Rubio&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-27T13:00:54.185366", "ruling_date": "2018-02-28T16:44:19", "ruling_headline": "Rubio's tweet about NY gun law is accurate", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubios-tweet-about-ny-gun-laws-accurate", "ruling_link_text": "Feature banned in NY", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/966726649441071104\">Tweet from Sen.
