At one point, he lamented the economic hardship in his city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mayor distributed a <a href=\"http://www.newgeography.com/content/002956-core-city-growth-mainly-below-poverty-line\"><u>list</u></a> that showed the ratio of city poverty to suburban poverty in the nation&rsquo;s 51 largest metropolitan areas, those with a metro population above 1 million. Then he said of Milwaukee:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are the only metropolitan area in the entire country where you&rsquo;ve got that ratio higher than four, meaning that the poverty rate is four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs. Only one. Only one.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no question the city of Milwaukee has had<strong> </strong>some of the highest poverty rates in the country.

In other words, the city&rsquo;s poverty rate was 4.3 times higher than the suburban rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, as Barrett said, Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a ratio above 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three next-highest ratios behind Milwaukee, along with the city poverty rate vs. the suburban rate were:</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Metro area</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>City poverty rate</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Suburban rate</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Ratio</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Hartford, Conn.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>31.2%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>7.8%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>3.99</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Baltimore</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>25.6%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>6.7%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>3.80</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Rochester, N.Y.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>33.8%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>9.3%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>3.62</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Newer numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly a week before Barrett made his claim, the U.S. Census bureau released new poverty figures -- for 2012.
