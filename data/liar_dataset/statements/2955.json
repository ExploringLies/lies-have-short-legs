The claim relied on an analysis based on a host of assumptions, including the impact of an entirely built network connecting Midwest cities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven the more recent outcry over the rail money, we decided to start our count anew.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic Party told us it pegged the loss at 13,000 jobs based on a <a href=\"http://cdn.publicinterestnetwork.org/assets/85764dcd3d2095f558552086d8d02075/Connecting-the-Midwest-vWI-web.pdf\">report</a> on the high-speed rail project by the <a href=\"http://www.wispirg.org/foundation\">WISPIRG Foundation</a>, which supported the project. WISPIRG is a nonprofit group that <a href=\"http://www.wispirg.org/foundation/mission2\">says</a> it &quot;works to protect consumers and promote good government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBruce Speight, WISPIRG&rsquo;s state director, said WISPIRG used Wisconsin&rsquo;s federal <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/recovery/docs/rail-grant-5.pdf\">grant </a><a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/recovery/docs/rail-grant-5.pdf\">application</a> for the rail money to arrive at the 13,000 jobs. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere are the number of full-time-equivalent jobs the state&rsquo;s application projected would be created during construction of the Milwaukee-to-Madison line:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tYear 1: 1,281</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tYear 2: 4,060</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tYear 3: 5,535</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tYear 4: 1,847</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tYear 5: 621</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tYear 6: 250</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThink about the figures this way:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state projected that in Year 1, the rail line construction itself, plus economic activity generated by the construction, would create 1,281 jobs&rsquo; worth of work; in Year 2, there would be 4,060 jobs&rsquo; worth of work; and so on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe figures represent &quot;job-years,&quot; not actual jobs, said Jon Dyck, a fiscal analyst at the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. A job-year, he said, is one person being employed for one year as a result of the rail line construction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://www.greatermadisonchamber.com/files/UserFiles/File/Richards_High%20Speed%20Rail_11-22-10%20%282%29.pdf\">memo</a> Dyck wrote on the project, he cited the number of jobs per year that the state had projected in its grant application. He did not add the figures for the six years together to arrive at a total jobs figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that is what the Democratic Party did -- just as WISPIRG did in its report -- to get its total of 13,000 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat approach can lead to double counting. Clearly, some of the people hired in Year 1 will also be working in Year 2.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, the state&rsquo;s numbers show a rise of employment, as construction peaks, and then a fall as it tails off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Year 3, for example, the amount of work was projected to produce 5,535 jobs, but that number drops to 1,847 in Year 4.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut under the math used to get to 13,000, they&rsquo;re actually added together, for a total of 7,382 jobs in years 3 and 4. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocratic Gov. Jim Doyle was the first to use that approach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the state filed its grant application in October 2009, Doyle&rsquo;s office issued a <a href=\"http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=19&amp;prid=4613\">news </a><a href=\"http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=19&amp;prid=4613\">release</a> saying the rail line would create &quot;nearly 13,000 jobs by 2013.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel later <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/83698652.html\">reported</a>, however, that the only way to reach that figure (12,723) would be to add the jobs from years 1 through 4.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you carried out Doyle&rsquo;s job counting over the full six years that were covered in the state&rsquo;s application, you would exceed 13,000 jobs -- the number the Democratic Party seized on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoyle&rsquo;s administration defended its method of counting to the newspaper, saying the grant application simply followed a formula requested by the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Doyle&rsquo;s job counting led the WISPIRG Foundation to issue a <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/%27Connecting+the+Midwest%27+Report+Data+Clarification+_2_.pdf\">correction</a> of its report, Speight told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Since then, WISPIRG, like some other rail supporters, estimates only that &quot;thousands&quot; of jobs would have been created by the Milwaukee-to-Madison line.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, in the <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=220243\">statement</a> Doyle issued after loss of the federal funds, he referred only to &quot;thousands of jobs&quot; that the money could have created in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic Party, however, stayed with 13,000 -- not only in its news release, but in a <a href=\"http://d21971ua898zk6.cloudfront.net/39/cf/3/676/wanted_billboard.jpg\">billboard</a> it put up in Milwaukee four days later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings us to the end of the line.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Democratic Party claimed that Walker&rsquo;s opposition to high-speed rail not only cost Wisconsin nearly $810 million in federal funds, but it &quot;killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs.&quot; The party relied on a report by an organization that two months earlier had disavowed the number after it was discredited by the Journal Sentinel. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerhaps thousands of jobs were at stake, but there is no evidence that 13,000 jobs were lost. What&rsquo;s more, that has been clear for some time -- and most everyone else has stopped using the figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the party&rsquo;s claim as Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-13T17:54:20.978646", "ruling_date": "2010-12-14T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democratic Party says Scott Walker killed 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin by opposing high-speed rail", "ruling_headline_slug": "democratic-party-says-scott-walker-killed-13000-jo", "ruling_link_text": "The number is rife with double-counting \u2013 even the original source has corrected it to simply \u201cthousands\u201d", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview, Governor-elect Scott Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie, Dec. 10, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, Dec. 10, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Transportation <a href=\"http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot20810.html\">announcement</a>, Dec. 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.greatermadisonchamber.com/files/UserFiles/File/Richards_High%20Speed%20Rail_11-22-10%20%282%29.pdf\">Milwaukee to Madison High Speed Rail project memo</a>, Nov. 22, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatements issued Dec. 9, 2010, by <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/printerfriendly.iml?Article=220259\">Wisconsin state Rep.
