But was that a come-from-behind win?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a campaign stop to the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton riled up the crowd with a quip about Villanova&rsquo;s buzzer-beating final shot that clinched the Wildcats the national championship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I love those come-from-behind victories,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, it was an off-the-cuff remark about a basketball game. But, given the enthusiasm of Philadelphia sports fans, we decided to check the claim: Was Villanova&rsquo;s win really&nbsp;of the &quot;come-from behind&quot; variety?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wildcats fans may have been sweating the last few minutes, but Villanova never trailed in the closing stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within minutes, Clinton&rsquo;s campaign defended the remark, saying UNC was leading at the half and,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-march-madness-predictions/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(38, 138, 140); line-height: inherit; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">citing FiveThirtyEight,</a>&nbsp;added that the Tar Heels were about twice as likely to win the game at that point before &#39;Nova came back to take the lead in the second half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to tip-off, &lsquo;Nova was a three-point underdog in the final game of March Madness, despite coming off a 44-point win over Oklahoma in the semi-finals. Villanova was down to North Carolina 39-34 at the half, then trailed by seven points with 19:16 to play in the game before, yes, mounting a comeback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the last lead the Tar Heels held came at the 15:20-minute&nbsp;mark of the second half. The game was tied a few times, but Carolina never held another lead the entire game. Villanova, however, had a 10-point lead with 5:29 to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wildcats&rsquo; lead at that time was seemingly so insurmountable,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/FiveThirtyEight/status/717186477936025600\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(38, 138, 140); line-height: inherit; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">that Nate Silver&rsquo;s FiveThirtyEight tweeted</a>&nbsp;there was a 96 percent chance Villanova would would win the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As UNC chipped away to tie things up with seconds left, &lsquo;Nova held on for dear life before Kris Jenkins hit the game winning shot. That three-pointer that went in as the final second on the clock ticked away won the game, 77-74, for Villanova.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said during a campaign stop at the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia that she loves &quot;those come-from-behind victories.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Villanova didn&rsquo;t trail in the last 15:20 of the game. Yes, the Cats made a last-second shot to win. But if they missed, the game would have moved onto overtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To steal another basketball cliche, this claim is a bit of a brick. We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-06T13:04:02.316560", "ruling_date": "2016-04-06T13:02:13", "ruling_headline": "Was Villanova\u2019s big win a \u2018come-from-behind victory,\u2019 as Hillary Clinton said?", "ruling_headline_slug": "was-villanovas-big-win-come-behind-victory-hillary", "ruling_link_text": "This wasn't one of them", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email,&nbsp;Josh Schwerin, Hillary For America.
