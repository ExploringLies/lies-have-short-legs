Its judge, Suzanne Covington, is stepping down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpposing Patterson in the March 2 Democratic primary is Austin lawyer Amy Clark Meachum, a partner in the law firm McGinnis, Lochridge &amp; Kilgore. Meachum&#39;s readiness to be a judge draws fire from Patterson in a TV ad that debuted on Austin News 8 on Jan. 20, whose narrator writes Meachum off, saying: &quot;Zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench &mdash; our legal system is no place for on-the-job training.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeachum&#39;s campaign drew our attention to the ad when her field director, Katie Naranjo, issued this response: &quot;Yesterday, Amy&#39;s opponent, Jan Patterson, launched a personal, negative television ad... if you are as disappointed as I am that Jan Patterson would resort to personal attacks against Amy, click here and make a contribution to our campaign so we can respond.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeachum doesn&#39;t deny Patterson&#39;s charges, though, writing to us: &quot;I have not hidden from nor run from the fact that I have never been a judge.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In the past decade, I have more experience in the civil district court that I am running for than Justice Patterson does,&quot; she said. &quot;She has been an appellate judge &mdash; I have been a civil trial attorney.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeachum estimated that she&#39;s litigated 50-70 cases in Travis County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPatterson is correct that Meachum has never been a judge.
