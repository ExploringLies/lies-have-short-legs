The TV station reported that&nbsp;&quot;at least 60 died from heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two, bringing this year&#39;s total to 109.&quot; The report said that the number could rise as toxicology results were received in additional cases, but the 60 deaths outpaced the previous one-month record of 57 drug fatalities in September 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data came from i<a href=\"http://executive.cuyahogacounty.us/en-US/Heroin-Fentanyl-Overdoses-February.aspx\">nformation released by the medical examiner</a> to the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christopher Harris, a spokesman for the medical examiner, told PolitiFact that the final number for February 2017 for opioid-related deaths was 65. For all of 2017, there were 727 total drug deaths; 553 opioid related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018 so far, there have been at least 137 suspected opioid related deaths:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio is <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/infographic/medicaids-role-in-addressing-opioid-epidemic/\">one of the hardest hit states in the nation</a> by the opioid epidemic. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2018/apr/12/richard-cordray/cordray-point-about-increase-firearm-deaths-ohio/\">increase in homicides in Ohio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline said, &quot;BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio.&quot; The scare-tactic headline creates a false impression that something catastrophic happened to cause 60 people to suddenly drop dead. In reality, the Cuyahoga Medical Examiner initially found that 60 died from overdoses in February 2017, and later reported the final number was 65. So the number is also incomplete and outdated.
