The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/just-one-state-cost-illegals-los-angeles/\">according to Snopes.com</a>. Six years later, we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-more-43-percent-all-food-stamps/\">checked</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/20/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-less-2-percent-illegals-are-pic/\">several</a> of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/facebook-posts/facebook-post-60-percent-public-housing/\">the claims</a> ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x96xjqvXuUttaMZn-r-HXW5i3lkWpgRKJCnTvwK9LYw-RBzbxGrROMEysu2kjVMAksmNjWlOLiLrncCngoJFkWUWTVKK0IruHbeBnbFJHPvmZDxBP1Iduue1u0chkOGaAXmBmei-\" style=\"border:none; height:520px; width:480px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll fact-check No. 4: &quot;More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medi-Cal is the name of California&rsquo;s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state. Undocumented immigrants <a href=\"https://www.coveredca.com/individuals-and-families/getting-covered/immigrants/\">may be eligible</a> for health plan options through Medi-Cal, although the benefits may be limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent complete data we found was from 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That year, <a href=\"https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/6038-total-births-by-race#detailed/2/6,9,20/false/573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35,18,17/3,2,1,4,13/12703,12704\">the state had</a> 502,120 total births. According to <a href=\"http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/Documents/Medi-Cal_Birth_Statistics_Presentation.pdf\">Medi-Cal</a>, 50.4 percent of the state&rsquo;s births that year were paid for by Medi-Cal. That works out to 253,068 total births on Medi-Cal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medi-Cal also reported that 29 percent of Medi-Cal mothers in 2011 were undocumented. So that year, 73,390 undocumented mothers gave birth on Medi-Cal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a percentage of all births in the state, that works out to about 15 percent -- not 66 percent, as the meme says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we initially published this article, a spokeswoman for California&#39;s Department of Health Care Services provided statistics for 2012 and 2013. As it turns out, the percentage declined in those years -- to 13.4 percent in 2012 and 12.6 percent in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its previous review of these claims, Snopes evaluated an earlier version of the assertion that was worded, &quot;Over 2/3&rsquo;s of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal whose births were paid for by taxpayers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we looked at the data for Los Angeles in 2013, the most recent year we could find on the <a href=\"http://informaticsportal.cdph.ca.gov/chsi/vsqs/\">California Department of Public Health website</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t support the earlier version of the claim either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That year, about 57 percent of births to residents of Los Angeles were Hispanic. But that refers to all Hispanic births -- not just those to undocumented immigrants, who accounted for only a fraction of the total Hispanic population.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The meme says, &quot;More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s wrong. Between 2011 and 2013, the most recent years available, between 12 percent and 15&nbsp;percent of all births statewide were to undocumented immigrants using Medicaid, not 66 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE, July 5, 7:00 p.m.: </strong>This article has been updated with the most recent figures provided by California&#39;s Department of Health Care Services.
