He characterized the Democratic Party as increasingly supportive of abortion, &quot;without restriction and with taxpayer funding.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen he got to China.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn&#39;t second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;That to me is pretty extreme.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to fact-check whether Ryan was describing Biden&rsquo;s position accurately.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a little background: China&rsquo;s one-child per-couple policy dates back to 1979, when the government became alarmed by its rapid population growth during the prior 30 years. As a response, it restricted the number of children to one per family, with some exceptions. China&rsquo;s population growth rate slowed with each ensuing decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the population-control measure has received widespread <a href=\"http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1950_population.htm\">criticism</a> from the international community because government officials in localities have been known to <a href=\"https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/691/13PacRimLPolyJ229.pdf?sequence=1\">force</a> women with unauthorized pregnancies to get abortions and sterilizations. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tForced abortions are <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/07/05/156211106/after-a-forced-abortion-a-roaring-debate-in-china\">illegal</a> in China, and recent news <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/world/asia/pressure-to-repeal-chinas-one-child-law-is-growing.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">reports</a> suggest they became less frequent in the last decade, but they still <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/15/world/la-fg-china-abortions-20120616\">happen</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What Biden said</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a 2011 visit to Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, Biden answered a student&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/08/21/remarks-vice-president-sichuan-university\">question</a> about the United States&rsquo; downgraded credit rating and its plan for reducing the deficit. The solution, Biden said, was to reform U.S. entitlement programs such as Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said as the Baby Boomer generation retires, a relatively small working population will be left to support those retirees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogcvQ8fjIFc\">likened</a> the situation to China&rsquo;s growing inequity in the ratio of workers to seniors -- &nbsp;a consequence of its one-child policy:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As I was talking to some of your leaders, you share a similar concern here in China. You have no safety net. Your policy has been one which I fully understand -- I&rsquo;m not second-guessing -- of one child per family. The result being that you&rsquo;re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Biden did make a trip to China and said he fully understood and did not second-guess the country&rsquo;s one-child policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReproductive rights advocates have room for displeasure here -- he had an opportunity to condemn the policy and he didn&rsquo;t. But that&rsquo;s far from an affirmative endorsement that Ryan&rsquo;s words imply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShortly after Biden&rsquo;s China visit, the White House argued that he called the one-child policy unsustainable. He didn&rsquo;t though: He said a situation in which one worker takes care of four retired people is &quot;not sustainable.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn response to criticism about Biden&rsquo;s remarks at the time, a White House spokeswoman said Biden &quot;strongly opposes all aspects of China&rsquo;s coercive birth limitation policies, including forced abortion and sterilization&quot; and &quot;believes such practices are repugnant.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan accused Biden of going to China and saying he &quot;sympathized and wouldn&rsquo;t second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBiden did not use the word &quot;sympathize&quot; and didn&rsquo;t endorse the one-child policy. Instead, he said that he understood it and wouldn&rsquo;t second-guess it. &nbsp;Days after the speech, his spokeswoman said he specifically condemned &quot;coercive birth limitation policies.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s claim contains a kernel of truth, but it ignores critical context that would leave a different impression.
