But what everyone knows is wrong. Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHas government employment really gone down in the past two and a half years? We looked in the databases for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government&rsquo;s official tabulator of employment statistics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe found that between January 2009 (when Obama took office) and June 2011 (the most recent month available), Krugman was right for overall government employment -- the combination of federal, state and local government workers. Overall government employment declined by 518,000 workers, or about 2.3 percent of the January 2009 level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo his statistic is correct. But the closer you look at the data, the more varied the data becomes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, let&rsquo;s look at federal government employment, which accounts for just 13 percent of all government employment. The number of federal workers has increased by 38,000 over the same period -- an increase of 1.4 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if you separate out the U.S. Postal Service, the growth was even bigger. Non-postal federal employment -- about 10 percent of all government employment -- increased over the same period by 139,000 workers, or 6.7 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe decline in government employment clearly wasn&rsquo;t driven by job losses at the federal level. It came from state and local government. So we&rsquo;ll look at the trends for those categories here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nState employment accounts for 23 percent of the government workforce. State government payrolls declined by 113,000 over the same period, or 2.2 percent. Within this category, state education workers -- who account for a little under half of state workers -- actually rose slightly over the period. The hits were taken in the remainder of the state workforce -- a decline of 115,500, or 4.1 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the biggest declines in the government sector came in local government. Local government -- which accounts for 64 percent of all government employment -- fell by 443,000 workers, or 3 percent. That accounts for a huge portion of the half-million decrease in jobs that Krugman cited.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEducation workers at the local level fared worse than those at the state level. Local education workers declined by 204,800, or 2.5 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNon-education workers in local government fared even worse -- employment was down 238,400, or 3.7 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe decline in government workers has certainly had an impact on the overall employment picture. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, private payrolls have increased by more than 1 million workers, but government payrolls have declined by 493,000 -- cutting the number of jobs created almost in half.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo how does all this relate to Krugman&rsquo;s comment? The fact that federal employment outside the Postal Service has risen by 6.7 percent in the past two and a half years is an important point to recognize for anyone studying employment trends. But Krugman was careful enough to avoid suggesting that federal employment declined by a half-million jobs. In fact, since a large chunk of the stimulus came in the form of aid to states -- specifically to help save jobs in education and other government sectors -- using total government employment figures as a yardstick seems reasonable to us. So we rate his statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-11T14:11:41.974524", "ruling_date": "2011-07-11T14:40:33", "ruling_headline": "Paul Krugman says government jobs have fallen by half million since January 2009", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-krugman-says-government-jobs-have-fallen-half", "ruling_link_text": "A bump in federal workers was more than cancelled out by losses at state, local levels", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Paul Krugman, &quot;No, We Can&rsquo;t?
