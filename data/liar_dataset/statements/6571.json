Chris Christie said he faced down the impossible when he took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican governor told an audience at the Republican National Convention during his keynote address Tuesday night that despite the doubts of naysayers, he steered New Jersey off a path that &quot;we could no longer afford to follow.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Now they said it was impossible this is what they told me to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years. That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit. &nbsp;But three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes,&quot; Christie said. &quot;We did it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere, we&rsquo;ll assess the governor&rsquo;s claim that he balanced a budget with an $11 billion deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. Christie has met that obligation in every budget year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe major flaw with the governor&rsquo;s claim is that the deficit he cites never went away. And Christie now dismisses that deficit calculation as the &quot;old way of budgeting.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year, when Christie proposed his first spending plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the state does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that&rsquo;s largely what Christie did in his first budget.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe governor skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment. He didn&rsquo;t fully fund the school aid formula. He didn&rsquo;t fully fund the state&rsquo;s property tax rebate program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the next budget year, the state still had a projected structural deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Christie then dismissed that calculation, calling it the &quot;old way of budgeting.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a budget speech last year, Christie said the projected deficit &quot;assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday&rsquo;s New Jersey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tNow, Christie said, &quot;the baseline is zero&quot; for budgeting.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said naysayers said it was &quot;impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit&quot; and &quot;we did it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie uses to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s important context Christie&rsquo;s statement lacks.
