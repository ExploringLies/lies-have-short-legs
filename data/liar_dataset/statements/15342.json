But it offers no evidence to support the claim about Gates&rsquo; children and their vaccination records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their 2018 annual letter, the Gateses said they&rsquo;ve &quot;spent $15.3 billion on vaccines over the past 18 years. And it&rsquo;s been a terrific investment.&quot; (The Gates children are 15, 18 and 22 years old.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melinda Gates in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BfgVhMmhfuU/?taken-by=melindafrenchgates\">Feb. 22 Instagram post</a> wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When my first child, Jenn, was born, over 800,000 children were dying each year of rotavirus &mdash; a preventable, curable disease. It broke my heart to imagine watching your child get sick and knowing that medicine could save her &mdash; if only you had access to it. That was a clarifying moment for me. No child should die a preventable death.
