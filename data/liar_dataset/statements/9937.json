Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown heats up, the attacks are growing more intense. In a recent radio ad, Shaheen accused Brown of being too friendly with Wall Street when serving as a senator from neighboring Massachusetts from 2010 to 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the 60-second ad&rsquo;s narration:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Wonder why Scott Brown lost re-election in Massachusetts? Well, he was working for Wall Street, not the people. Scott Brown blocked a major financial reform bill until he could water it down and save Wall Street $19 billion. Scott Brown really delivered for Wall Street, said the Boston Globe. Even after the bill passed, news reports show Brown was &lsquo;secretly serving the interests of Wall Street, working behind the scenes to help the big banks, not consumers.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Wall Street thanked Scott Brown by giving him more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million. Now, Scott Brown wants New Hampshire to send him to Washington. Wall Street&rsquo;s once again spending millions to help. Scott Brown says he really cares about New Hampshire. Come on, don&rsquo;t be fooled. No matter where he lives, Scott Brown will always put Wall Street first. And that&rsquo;s good for Scott Brown, but not New Hampshire.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot to chew on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New Hampshire already checked a claim by a pro-Shaheen group that Brown&rsquo;s actions had saved &quot;big banks $19 billion in taxes,&quot; rating it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/feb/11/senate-majority-pac/pro-democratic-pac-says-scott-brown-delivered-wall/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the ad&rsquo;s claim that &quot;Wall Street&quot; gave him &quot;more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million&quot;? We decided to take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shaheen campaign pointed us to calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics, whose <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/\">opensecrets.org</a> website tracks a wide variety of campaign-finance data. It&rsquo;s a trusted source that we&rsquo;ve used many times in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shaheen campaign&rsquo;s $5.3 million figure refers to how much Brown received in the 2012 campaign cycle -- when he lost his seat to Democrat Elizabeth Warren -- from donors categorized as being part of the finance, insurance and real estate sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F&amp;cycle=2012&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=N\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>dollar figure is correct</u></a> -- as is Brown&rsquo;s No. 1 ranking among all Senate candidates for donations from that sector -- but Shaheen&rsquo;s ad stretches a bit when it calls this &quot;Wall Street.&quot; Most &quot;finance&quot; firms have a reasonable claim on being part of Wall Street, but a lot of the insurance and real-estate sectors fall outside that category. Also, not everyone working at these firms is a financial mogul, but their individual donations still count towards the total. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we decided to drill down a little deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a few sub-categories of &quot;finance/insurance/real estate&quot; that are a closer fit to &quot;Wall Street.&quot; They include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Securities and investment</strong>: Brown ranked first among Senate candidates in the 2012 campaign cycle with <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F07&amp;cycle=2012&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=N\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$2,682,872</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Private equity and investment firms</strong>: Brown ranked first with <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F2600&amp;cycle=2012&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=N\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$556,092</u></a> in donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Hedge funds</strong>: Brown ranked first with <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F2700&amp;cycle=2012&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=N\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$306,800</u></a> in donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Venture capital</strong>: Brown ranked first with <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F2500&amp;cycle=2012&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=N\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$262,081</u></a> in donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This provides support for the notion that Brown ranked No. 1 in these types of donations. But he ranked a little lower in two other categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Finance and credit companies</strong>: Brown ranked ninth with <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F06&amp;cycle=2012&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=N\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$54,450</u></a> in donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Commercial banks</strong>: Brown ranked third with <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F03&amp;cycle=2012&amp;recipdetail=S&amp;mem=N\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$297,539</u></a> in donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Brown&rsquo;s total haul from these six categories was about $4.2 million, or about one-fifth lower than what the ad said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the first time that Shaheen&rsquo;s campaign has used somewhat loose language in describing Brown&rsquo;s donors. When a previous Shaheen ad claimed that &quot;Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,&quot; we rated that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/sep/05/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-big-oil-gave-scott-brown-45426/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True</u></a>, noting that only about 11.5 percent of Brown&rsquo;s haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider &quot;Big Oil.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Brown&rsquo;s staff, spokeswoman Elizabeth Guyton said, &quot;Scott Brown&rsquo;s fundraising is no different than Jeanne Shaheen&rsquo;s in that they both accept contributions from the financial services industry. The only difference is that Jeanne Shaheen is hypocritically attacking him for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the 2012 election cycle -- when Brown was receiving $5.3 million from the finance/insurance/real estate sector -- Shaheen accepted just $64,139 from the same sector, ranking 65th among all Senate candidates. In the current cycle, she has accepted $565,935 from the finance/insurance/real estate sector, ranking her 21st among Senate candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaheen&rsquo;s ad said that in 2012, &quot;Wall Street&quot; gave Scott Brown &quot;more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you put together six categories that might reasonably be considered &quot;Wall Street,&quot; Brown received about $4.2 million in all, and he finished first among Senate candidates in four of those six categories. However, the total amount is short of the $5.3 million claimed in the ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is generally accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-19T15:23:08.382011", "ruling_date": "2014-09-19T16:08:08", "ruling_headline": "Jeanne Shaheen says 'Wall Street' gave Scott Brown more money than any other candidate", "ruling_headline_slug": "jeanne-shaheen-says-wall-street-gave-scott-brown-m", "ruling_link_text": "Not quite that much, but still a lot", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jeanne Shaheen for Senate, transcript of &quot;Fooled&quot; (radio ad), accessed Sept. 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?Ind=F\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>finance/insurance/real estate main page</u></a>, accessed Sept. 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New Hampshire, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/feb/11/senate-majority-pac/pro-democratic-pac-says-scott-brown-delivered-wall/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pro-Democratic PAC says Scott Brown &#39;delivered for Wall Street, saving big banks $19 billion in taxes</u></a>,&#39;&quot; Feb. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New Hampshire, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/sep/05/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-big-oil-gave-scott-brown-45426/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Jeanne Shaheen says &#39;Big Oil&#39; gave Scott Brown $454,260</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Harrell Kirstein, spokesman for Jeanne Shaheen, Sept. 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Elizabeth Guyton, spokeswoman for Scott Brown, Sept. 19, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jeanne", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 562, "last_name": "Shaheen", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "jeanne-shaheen", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/shaheenpix.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/562/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://shaheen.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>In 2012, &quot;Wall Street&quot; gave Scott Brown &quot;more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio ad", "statement_date": "2014-09-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 153, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/153/", "subject": "Financial Regulation", "subject_slug": "financial-regulation", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 311, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/311/", "subject": "Message Machine 2014", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2014", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 312, "last_name": "Brown", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "scott-brown", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Brown.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Hampshire", "edition": "New Hampshire", "edition_slug": "new-hampshire", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 47, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Hampshire Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/47/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/312/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
