And so he&rsquo;s going up the rickety elevator to go up to the residence, the second floor, and the eager aide to President Obama says with great excitement, &lsquo;Senator, you&rsquo;re the first Republican he&rsquo;s had dinner with in the residence since he&rsquo;s been president.&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s the fifth year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama is so unwilling to work with&nbsp;Senate Republicans, Bush alleges, that he didn&#39;t even invite one to dine at the White House until his fifth year in office. But is it true?&nbsp;Did Obama really wait until 2013 to host a Republican for dinner at the White House?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s campaign declined to provide more information or sources for the anecdote. (Instead, a spokeswoman issued a statement saying the president has pursued &quot;a policy of divide and conquer&quot; and refused to work with Republicans.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House, meanwhile, referred us to the official <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/visitor-records\">White House Visitor Access Records</a>, which are posted online in a series of spreadsheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Visitor Access Records contain extremely detailed &ndash; albeit inconsistently organized &ndash; entries for hundreds of thousands of White House visits. The 2012 database, for example, included more than 930,000 separate records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To vet Bush&rsquo;s statement, we filtered these voluminous results first to show only visits in which &quot;POTUS&quot; &ndash; that is, the president of the United States &ndash; was listed as the &quot;visitee.&quot; Then we filtered them further to capture visits to the &quot;Residence&quot; and other White House rooms in which it&rsquo;s conceivable that a private dinner could occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among that filtered database, we searched for Democratic and Republican U.S. senators. Here&rsquo;s what we found. When possible, we paired the results found in the database with news reports or White House statements concerning the meeting or a concurrent event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2009</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar. R-Ind., visited the residence area of the White House on Sept. 1, 2009, for an evening event. The day and time corresponds to <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/09/68498271/1%20-%20.VkuEzHarS00#.Vkzqz3arS00\">a dinner celebrating Ramadan that included&nbsp;numerous guests</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2010</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There appear to be no dinners or other events involving the president and members of the Senate in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be noted, though, that <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/04/obama-plans-slurpee-summit-with-dinner/\">Obama did invite Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Jon Kyl</a> of Arizona,&nbsp;along with top Republicans from the House and Democratic leaders from both chambers,&nbsp;to a dinner following the midterm elections that November. That meal-time meeting was dubbed the &quot;Slurpee Summit&quot; after Obama promised to serve the drinks for dessert, but <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/18/mcconnell-obama-dinner-federalist-society_n_785717.html\">Republicans declined to attend</a>, and the dinner was canceled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama <a href=\"http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/flz4HjgulMT/Obama+Hosts+Bipartisan+Congressional+Leaders/x_fLKZndX-s\">hosted a dinner in the East Room of the White House</a> (which is on the State Floor in the residence) attended by both Democrats and Republicans on May 2, 2011.
