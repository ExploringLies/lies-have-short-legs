Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. Now, that&#39;s real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we&rsquo;ll look at the employment claim -- &quot;nearly 15 million new jobs.&quot; Is that correct?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, to get that number, Clinton fuzzes the time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do it, she picked the low point of the job market under Obama. From that point, the United States has gained nearly 15 million private-sector jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the number of employed Americans bottomed out in February 2010 with 107.3 million jobs and rebounded, as of June 2016, to just over 122 million jobs. That&rsquo;s an increase of about 14.8 million jobs -- a reasonable approximation for Clinton&rsquo;s phrasing of &quot;nearly 15 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But note the time frame for that calculation. It doesn&rsquo;t start at the point &quot;when they&quot; -- Obama and Biden -- &quot;took office.&quot; February 2010 was just over a year after Obama and Biden were sworn in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially, Obama and Biden took office as the recession was spiraling to its low point, but it took a while to hit bottom. So after they were sworn in, the number of jobs continued to fall for a year as they worked to stop the economic freefall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that starting the count in February 2010 is something economists have told us is actually a reasonable decision, since the recession began under George W. Bush and Obama can&rsquo;t reasonably be blamed for job losses in the earliest part of his tenure, when the die was already cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Clinton glossed over the difference in the time frame by starting the count at their inauguration. And how big a difference does this make? It&rsquo;s not trivial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using this measurement, the number of jobs rose&nbsp;from about 111.5 million in January 2009 to 122.1 million in June 2016. That&rsquo;s an increase of 10.6 million jobs, or only about two-thirds of the nearly 15 million total Clinton touted in her speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also note that Clinton chose to use private-sector jobs as the benchmark. That boosts the numbers a bit compared to total jobs because widespread budget-cutting in states and localities has led to a smaller government workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If she had cited total employment gains rather than private-sector gains, the increases would have been a little lower -- an increase of 10.1 million jobs (from the start of Obama&rsquo;s term) or 14.4 million jobs (from the low point in February 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll note, as we regularly do, that no elected official deserves full credit (or blame) for economic results on their watch. Policies pursued by a president can help the economy, but other factors beyond the reach of a president -- from technological change to improvements in the global economy -- also play a role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton specified &quot;when they took office&quot; in her speech, and the actual number of jobs starting with their inauguration is only about two-thirds as big -- 10.6 million jobs. The 15 million number uses a different, more limited timeframe to count job creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b765565f-195e-4f51-959a-9193fbebf204\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b765565f-195e-4f51-959a-9193fbebf204</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-29T00:06:33.565027", "ruling_date": "2016-07-29T00:05:14", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton's Half True claim on job recovery during Obama's tenure", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-half-true-claim-about-job-recovery", "ruling_link_text": "That's not the count from day one", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, speech to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, July 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ce\">Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National)</a>,&quot; accessed July 28, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Our economy is so much stronger than when (Barack Obama and Joe Biden) took office.
