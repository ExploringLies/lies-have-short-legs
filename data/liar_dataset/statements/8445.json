Wendy Davis announced her run for governor, Texas Right to Life announced it would air a radio ad calling her an &quot;abortion zealot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/2013/10/03/texas-right-to-life-slams-abortion-activist-wendy-davis-in-new-hard-hitting-ad/\"><u>Audio</u></a> that the anti-abortion group released Oct. 3, 2013, of its ad said, &quot;Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a clear-cut<strong> </strong>statement, which the group also had on its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Oct. 3, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.texasrighttolife.com/a/1103/Texas-Right-to-Life-Exposes-Wendy-Davis-Abortion-Agenda\"><u>entry</u></a> on the site said<strong> </strong>that Davis&rsquo;s &quot;views are so fanatical that she opposes any safeguards for the unborn at any stage of pregnancy, up to and including the final weeks before birth&hellip; (Davis) thoroughly aired her abortion views during her 11-hour filibuster in June in her failed attempt to block the new Pro-Life law from passing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the group, Melissa Conway, told us by phone that her group could not immediately provide backup information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat, was indelibly linked to abortion issues by her June 25, 2013, filibuster, which made headlines worldwide and briefly helped derail changes in law intended to restrict abortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign spokesman Bo Delp told us by email<strong> </strong>it&rsquo;s incorrect to say Davis opposes any limits. &quot;Like most Texans, Sen. Davis opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered, in cases of rape or incest or in the case of severe and irreversible fetal abnormalities,&quot; Delp said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delp&rsquo;s response fits with an Oct. 5, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/in-polarized-world-of-abortion-politics-davis-and-/nbGTp/?icmp=statesman_internallink_textlink_apr2013_statesmanstubtomystatesman_launch\"><u>news story</u></a> in the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> saying that Davis, while <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1YEpT82Dbg\"><u>addressing</u></a> the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Aug. 5, 2013, was asked, &quot;Could you discuss what legal limits on abortion you do support?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She replied, &quot;You know, the Supreme Court has made that decision. And it&rsquo;s one of the protected liberties under our Constitution. And I respect the constitutional protections that are in place today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1973 landmark decision in <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\"><u>Roe v Wade</u></a> struck down a Texas law that banned all abortions except those performed to save the mother&rsquo;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The justices ruled then that states can&rsquo;t restrict or ban abortions in the first trimester (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prenatal-care/PR00112\"><u>roughly</u></a> three months or the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy). Their ruling said, though, that states can make laws governing abortions in the second trimester if the laws are &quot;reasonably related&quot; to the woman&rsquo;s health. After the point at which fetuses attain &quot;viability,&quot; meaning they can survive outside the womb, states can limit or ban abortions unless the woman&rsquo;s life is in danger, the court held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in her response in Washington, Davis signaled that she both accepts letting states limit abortions after the first trimester and limit or ban abortions after fetuses are viable, unless the mother&rsquo;s life is at risk. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elected to the Senate in 2008, Davis voted in <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/81r/pdf/81RSJ05-01-F.PDF#page=21\"><u>2009</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/82r/pdf/82RSJ05-03-F.PDF#page=12\"><u>2011</u></a> against state legislation requiring women to get sonograms before having an abortion. The measure passed into law in 2011 requires doctors performing abortions to provide a sonogram 24 hours before the abortion and describe what the image shows, including the fetus&#39; size, body features and internal organs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her 2013<strong> </strong>filibuster delayed, but didn&rsquo;t prevent the Republican-majority Legislature from approving restrictions that will soon begin taking effect. Starting Oct. 29, 2013, the law bans abortions after the 20th week post-fertilization, except when the woman&rsquo;s life is endangered or in cases of severe fetal abnormality; requires abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges in a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic; and beefs up regulations on the dispensing of abortion-inducing drugs.<strong> </strong>Starting Sept. 1, 2014, the law requires that all abortion clinics meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its October news story, the <em>Statesman </em>quoted a Davis adviser as saying that Davis would not have picked a fight over the 20-week provision by itself. However, she <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dQDJm0kjWNftgeEZ0wZJfDHRcN_xfzNHfPJTIlRfa48/edit\"><u>indicated</u></a> in the early part of her filibuster that she was opposed to that provision on medical grounds. &quot;From our medical community, we&rsquo;ve heard the concern that this interferes with the practice of medicine,&quot; Davis said, according to CounterPath Press&rsquo; <a href=\"http://counterpathpress.org/let-her-speak-transcript-of-texas-state-sentaor-wendy-daviss-june-25-2013-filibuster-of-the-texas-state-senate\"><u>transcript</u></a> of the filibuster. &quot;As important, we know that concerns have been raised that this ban interferes with a woman&rsquo;s health care decision before she and her doctor may have important health information about her own health and the health of the pregnancy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repeatedly during the filibuster, Davis said that a major reason she opposed the legislation was that in her view, its provisions were not intended to make women safer but to make sure fewer abortions were performed. &quot;I think that the state of Texas has already established a fine standard of care,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas Right to Life said, &quot;Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Davis has spoken and voted against certain abortion limits, her campaign statement and her stated support for the Roe v. Wade decision indicate she opposes late-term abortions except in extreme circumstances. The group did not provide, and we did not find, evidence of Davis opposing &quot;any limits on abortion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim as False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"><u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-22T18:51:38.737869", "ruling_date": "2013-10-22T17:49:07", "ruling_headline": "Davis opposes late-term abortions, with certain exceptions", "ruling_headline_slug": "davis-says-she-opposes-late-term-abortions-certain", "ruling_link_text": "Says she opposes most late-term abortions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/2013/10/03/texas-right-to-life-slams-abortion-activist-wendy-davis-in-new-hard-hitting-ad/\"><u>Audio</u></a> of Texas Right to Life ad, released Oct. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview with Melissa Conway, spokeswoman, Texas Right to Life, Oct. 21, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Bo Delp, director of communications, Davis campaign, Oct. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/in-polarized-world-of-abortion-politics-davis-and-/nbGTp/?icmp=statesman_internallink_textlink_apr2013_statesmanstubtomystatesman_launch\"><u>news story</u></a>, &quot;In polarized world of abortion politics, Davis and Abbott advance nuanced views,&quot; Oct. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\"><u>Roe v.
