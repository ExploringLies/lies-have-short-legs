-- with a sharp retort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the Wisconsin Democrat&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorBaldwin/status/839536700367880192\">tweet</a> on March 8, 2017, two days after <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/06/house-republicans-unveil-obamacare-replacement-bill/98826894/\">the unveiling</a> of the <a href=\"http://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/AmericanHealthCareAct.pdf\">the House GOP bill</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>#ReadtheBill &amp; you&rsquo;ll see #TrumpCare would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, the top executives at five major insurers -- Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealth, Anthem and Humana -- already make millions, with each CEO earning between $10.3 million and $17.3 million in 2015, according to the <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/07/news/companies/republican-healthcare-reform-tax-break-insurance-execs/\">latest figures</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could the CEOs make millions more as a result of the GOP bill?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There would be an opportunity for that: A proposed tax break in the bill connected to executive compensation would be worth millions of dollars to the health insurers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the tax break would go to corporations, not personally to the executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Baldwin&rsquo;s claim assumes the corporations would give millions of dollars in raises to the executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tax deduction change</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin&rsquo;s attack centers on a provision of the bill, which is <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article137384213.html\">supported</a> by President <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>, that would change a tax deduction:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Currently, Obamacare limits to $500,000 the amount of an individual executive&#39;s compensation that a health insurance company can deduct as a business expense.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The aim, as U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ron-kind/\">Ron Kind</a>, D-Wis., has <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?425045-2/ways-means-committee-markup-affordable-care-act-replacement-bill-part-1&amp;start=1690\">noted</a> was to prevent health insurers from passing along profits they made via Obamacare to their executives, and then deducting the cost of those raises on the company&rsquo;s taxes.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The GOP replacement bill would repeal the $500,000 limit, generally making the cap $1 million, the same amount that applies to other types of businesses. In other words, health insurance companies could increase their tax deduction.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The upshot for the federal government, as estimated by Congress&rsquo; nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation: <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?425045-2/ways-means-committee-markup-affordable-care-act-replacement-bill-part-1&amp;start=1690\">$400 million</a> in lost tax revenue over 10 years.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The effects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as Baldwin suggests, the GOP proposal would allow health insurers to claim a greater tax deduction for the pay it gives its top executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A CNN/Money <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/07/news/companies/republican-healthcare-reform-tax-break-insurance-execs/\">news report</a> said that of the $73 million paid to the CEOs of the five major insurers in 2015, only $2.5 million was deductible under Obamacare tax laws, but more than $70 million of it would be deductible under the Republican legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are other important facts to consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>It&rsquo;s misleading to say that executives would &quot;personally&quot; benefit from the change, given that the tax break is for corporations, not individuals.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The health insurance companies would have more of a financial incentive, in terms of tax deductions, to give raises to their executives. But even if the companies opted to provide bigger raises, there&rsquo;s no evidence that the executives would reap &quot;millions.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.itep.org/about/staff.php\">Matthew Gardner</a>, senior fellow at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told us:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A more accurate version of Baldwin&rsquo;s statement would be that Trumpcare would make it easier for insurance companies to increase their CEO&rsquo;s pay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin says &quot;&lsquo;Trumpcare&rsquo; would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One provision in a Trump-supported Republican bill to replace Obamacare is a tax break worth an estimated $400 million over 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that money could fund raises for health care company executives. But the tax break is for the companies, not individuals; the companies could use the savings for other purposes; and even if the savings were used for raises, there&rsquo;s no evidence that executives would get millions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-09T15:20:09.765531", "ruling_date": "2017-03-13T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Would 'Trumpcare,' the GOP replacement for Obamacare, allow insurance executives to 'make millions'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "would-trumpcare-gop-replacement-obamacare-allow-in", "ruling_link_text": "Tax break is for corporations, not executives", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Twitter, Tammy Baldwin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorBaldwin/status/839536700367880192\">tweet</a>, March 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?425045-2/ways-means-committee-markup-affordable-care-act-replacement-bill-part-1&amp;start=1690\">video</a> (28:00) of House Ways and Means Committee testimony of Joint Taxation Committee chief of staff Thomas Barthold, March 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Los Angeles Times opinion column, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-ceos-20170307-story.html\">&quot;Here&#39;s the secret payoff to health insurance CEOs buried in the GOP Obamacare repeal bill,&quot;
