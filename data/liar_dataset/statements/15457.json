He has consistently led in the polls in the race for governor &mdash; a late May <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1nn5d54r\">survey</a> showed him 13 percentage points ahead of second place Republican businessman John Cox. He was 26 points ahead of Chiang, who was next-to-last among the race&rsquo;s prominent candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, Newsom said he&rsquo;d prefer to face a Republican in the November run-off, making his attacks on Democrats like Chiang appear to be part of his strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chiang has served as treasurer since January 2015. Before that, he was the state&rsquo;s controller, akin to the state&rsquo;s chief financial officer, for eight years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked for evidence that &quot;the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion,&quot; Newsom&rsquo;s campaign pointed to a May 2014 <a href=\"http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/05/29/31-65-billion-california-accounting-errors-higher-than-combined-gdp-of-jamaica-iceland/\">news article</a> by CBS13, a Sacramento TV station. It was headlined &quot;$31.65 Billion: California Accounting Errors Higher Than Combined GDP Of Jamaica, Iceland.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CBS13 article refers to a scathing <a href=\"http://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2013-001.1.pdf\">May 2014 report</a> by the California State Auditor&rsquo;s Office that found deficiencies in the state&rsquo;s internal financial reporting practices. The mistakes ranged from understating liabilities, to miscalculating debt payments, to a data-entry error that added three extra zeros to a revenue figure, changing it from millions of dollars to billions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The number and magnitude of errors we found indicate the Controller&rsquo;s Office lacks a sufficient review process to prevent and detect significant errors,&quot; Deputy State Auditor John Collins concluded in the report, which was submitted to Gov. Jerry Brown and top state lawmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collins did not respond to requests for an interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stacking up $31 billion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state audit and a 2014 Sacramento Bee <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article2600043.html\">article</a>, which summarized the audit, were both referenced in the ad. The Bee article used a less sensational headline: Audit: State Controller&rsquo;s Office accounting riddled with errors, and had no mention of a $31 billion dollar figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audit itself does not literally say Chiang &quot;lost track of $31 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad, however, overlays &quot;$31 Billion&quot; in large, bold numerals at the top of an image of the auditor&rsquo;s report. The numbers even pop out at the viewer at one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That $31 billion figure comes from the TV station&rsquo;s article, which added up the dollar amounts of key mistakes cited in the audit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how CBS13 arrived at $31 billion:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;The audit revealed:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>-- $7.7 billion &ndash; Understated federal trust fund revenues and expenditures</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>-- $653 million &ndash; Overstated general fund assets and revenues</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>-- $8 billion &ndash; Overstated California State University&rsquo;s bond debt</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>-- $9.1 billion &ndash; Reporting error that understated a public building construction fund</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Also there was a deferred tax-revenue figure posted as $6.2 billion when it was actually $6.2 million.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>All told, that&rsquo;s more than $31 billion in mistakes.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked and found all of those figures in the audit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More to the story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s some truth to the ad&rsquo;s claim, given the critical nature of the audit and the large dollar figure mistakes it found. But the use of the phrase &quot;lost track of $31 billion&quot; is somewhat questionable. It could leave the impression that Chiang&rsquo;s actions led to the state actually losing that money, which it did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spot also omits the fact that Chiang&rsquo;s office acknowledged the problems and was taking steps to correct them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The (state controller&rsquo;s office) concurs with the California State Auditor&rsquo;s (CSAs) notation and believes that the challenges of high staff turnover and in recruiting qualified staff significantly contributed to the issues identified,&quot; the 2014 audit said. &quot;Other contributing factors included budget cuts and denial of financial resources, as well as poor quality and late submission of the financial data by numerous agencies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What did subsequent audits show? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2015, the state auditor&rsquo;s office released another <a href=\"https://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2014-001.1.pdf\">report</a> that &quot;concludes that the State continues to experience certain deficiencies in its accounting and administrative practices that affect its internal controls over financial reporting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report blamed agencies such as the Department of Education for inaccurate financial reporting, though it did not directly criticize the controller&rsquo;s office. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent auditor reports show apparent improvement in Chiang&rsquo;s final years as treasurer and those immediately after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2016-001.2.pdf\">March 2017 report</a>, for example, the auditor&rsquo;s report &quot;did not identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies&quot; in financial reporting for the fiscal year that ended in June 2016. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Response from Chiang&rsquo;s campaign </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chiang&rsquo;s campaign downplayed the significance of the 2014 audit report. They said a separate document, called a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, issued later that year was more reflective of the performance of the controller&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nobody is more a financial expert in the state than John,&quot; Chiang&rsquo;s campaign spokesman Fabien Levy said. &quot;Nobody is more obsessed with getting the numbers right.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TV attack ad by Gavin Newsom&rsquo;s campaign for governor claims &quot;the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars,&quot; when he was state controller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2014 state audit supports part of the claim. It criticized the state controller&rsquo;s office for understating billions of dollars in liabilities, miscalculating debt payments and making other errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TV news station added up some of the highest dollar figure mistakes and presented them as &quot;$31.65 billion in errors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state audit did not literally say the controller&rsquo;s office made &quot;$31 billion&quot; in mistakes, nor did it imply that the money was permanently lost under Chiang, but instead that his office made numerous accounting mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad also ignored that Chiang&rsquo;s office, according to the audit, acknowledged the mistakes, worked to fix them and blamed the errors on staffing shortages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s claim&nbsp;is partially accurate. But it takes information in the audit out of context and ignores key details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>HALF TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-01T14:00:39.871745", "ruling_date": "2018-06-01T13:09:08", "ruling_headline": "Fact-checking Gavin Newsom\u2019s attack: John Chiang \u2018lost track of $31 billion\u2019 ", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-john-chiang-lose-track-31-billion-californias-", "ruling_link_text": "Claim takes things out of context", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/pdfweb/videos/e9ecb68f-ca79-497b-a2ab-66be781aac93.mp4\">campaign attack ad</a>, May 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan Click, Newsom&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, email exchange May 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabien Levy, Chiang&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, phone interview May 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hollie Andrus, financial audit director, State of Utah, phone interview, May 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California State Auditor, <a href=\"http://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2013-001.1.pdf\">Internal Control and Compliance Audit Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2013</a>, May 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California State Auditor, <a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2014-001.1.pdf\">Internal Control and Compliance Audit Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2014</a>, March 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California State Auditor, <a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2015-001.1.pdf\">Internal Control and Compliance Audit Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2015</a>, March 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California State Auditor, <a href=\"https://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2016-001.2.pdf\">Internal Control and Compliance Audit Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2016</a>, March 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Controller&rsquo;s Office, <a href=\"https://www.sco.ca.gov/Files-ARD/CAFR/cafr13web.pdf\">Comprehensive Annual Financial Report</a>, For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sacramento Bee</em>, <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article2600043.html\">Audit: State Controller&rsquo;s Office accounting riddled with errors</a>, May 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS13 Sacramento, <a href=\"http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/05/29/31-65-billion-california-accounting-errors-higher-than-combined-gdp-of-jamaica-iceland/\">$31.65 Billion: California Accounting Errors Higher Than Combined GDP Of Jamaica, Iceland</a>, May 29, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "California Lt.
