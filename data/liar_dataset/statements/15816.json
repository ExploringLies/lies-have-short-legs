It is authored by Clean Missouri, a bipartisan group that aims to reduce the influence of lobbyists and corporations. It has attracted attacks from many politicians, including McDowell.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Given the strikingly different claims from Amendment 1 proponents and McDowell&#39;s surprising assertion about non-contiguity, we decided to assess her contention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The McDowell campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment, noting that she doesn&#39;t intend to take media interviews for approximately 60 days as of Aug. 27.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Who has power over redistricting?</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In the statement, McDowell claims that the auditor&#39;s office would have overwhelming control over the redistricting process, adding that the auditor&rsquo;s office &quot;could literally change the entire demographics of Missouri.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>She said earlier in the interview that Democrats back Amendment 1 so that Galloway can bend the maps in favor of her party.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Amendment 1 language gives the auditor&#39;s office just one role: making a list of potential non-partisan demographers from state residents who apply.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>From that list, the state Senate&#39;s majority and minority leaders would have to agree on one or accept a random lottery after each leader removes a third of the list.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>After the demographer draws up the maps, state legislative commissions can make any changes to it after holding a public hearing.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Benjamin Singer, communications director for Clean Missouri, said there was no language in the amendment specifying which part of the government the demographer works in, such as the auditor&#39;s office.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Must districts be contiguous?</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The question of whether St. Louis and &quot;a southwest Missouri Republican district&quot; could become a district without their borders touching is answered in the amendment, sort of.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Section 3 says new districts &quot;shall be composed of contiguous territory. Areas which meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Edward Greim, a lawyer who specializes in constitutional and election law, filed a lawsuit in August to remove Amendment 1 from the ballot. The lawsuit will be decided upon by a judge as early as this week. Greim said that on the surface, this language gives more teeth to contiguity than the current law.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But Greim said a loophole in the same section of the amendment prioritizes fairer dispersal of Republicans and Democrats in an area over contiguity. The phrase in question is that contiguity is &quot;subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b).&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;Now, they only need to be composed (of contiguous districts) if you have met A and B,&quot; Greim said. So if A and B can only be met without contiguity, then contiguity becomes moot, Greim said.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Ruth Greenwood, a redistricting attorney from Campaign Legal Center, said &quot;subject to&quot; simply means one requirement has a lower priority than another. &quot;It would ultimately be up to the court to interpret the text,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Do districts need to be half-Republican and half-Democrat?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Context is essential to McDowell&#39;s statement, as she said that non-contiguity is required because every district has to be close to 50 percent Republican and Democratic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But the amendment&#39;s requirement that any shift in the statewide electorate reflect a substantially proportionate shift in the state legislature would not be met if that was the case.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The amendment also requires the map to be drawn based on voting numbers from the sum of all districts. In other words, Greenwood said, the map can&#39;t be drawn solely on a district-by-district basis.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Why? Because a big goal of the amendment is to reduce the &quot;efficiency gap&quot; in votes. The statistic measures the difference in the number of votes that don&#39;t contribute to a win. After all, everything above 50 percent is not necessary. This would fight gerrymandering methods, where the goal is to increase the opposition party&#39;s so-called &quot;wasted votes&quot; while decreasing one party&#39;s own.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>What matters is not how red or blue a certain district is, but how &quot;efficient&quot; votes are being translated to representation.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>With the Clean Missouri model, not every district has to be &quot;50-50,&quot; as potential voting maps of other states have demonstrated. Rather, it simply seeks to reduce the disproportionate representation of the party in power.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>McDowell said that if Amendment 1 is enacted, the auditor&#39;s office will necessitate non-contiguous voting districts.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Specifically, she said the auditor&#39;s office &quot;could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don&#39;t even have to touch.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Her sentiment is too broad and mostly unfounded. Because the auditor&#39;s office does not have complete control over drawing districts, and Amendment 1 is not trying to make every district is evenly split between&nbsp;Republicans and Democrats, McDowell&#39;s allegation of non-contiguous voting districts becomes more dubious. Her supposed saving grace &mdash; &quot;subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b)&quot;&mdash; is highly debatable and best left up to legal parsing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-05T16:31:25.577644", "ruling_date": "2018-09-05T16:25:45", "ruling_headline": "McDowell claims Missouri Amendment 1 would adjoin distant voting districts", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcdowell-claims-missouri-amendment-1-would-adjoin-", "ruling_link_text": "Too broad and mostly unfounded", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Elections/Petitions/2018-048.pdf\">Amendment 1 text</a>, from Missouri Secretary of State website, accessed Aug. 25, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://971talk.radio.com/media/audio-channel/saundra-mcdowell-weekend-report\">Radio interview of Saundra McDowell on The Weekend</a>&nbsp;Report, published Aug. 20, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone conversation with Ruth Greenwood, redistricting attorney from<a href=\"http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/15th/\">&nbsp;Campaign Legal Center</a>, Aug. 30, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone conversation with Edward Greim, attorney, Aug. 27, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple phone conversations with Josh Smith, McDowell campaign representative, between Aug. 27 and Sept. 1, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone conversation with Benjamin Singer and Sean Nicholson of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cleanmissouri.org/\">Clean Missouri,</a>&nbsp;author of Amendment 1, Aug. 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>T<a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-math-behind-gerrymandering-and-wasted-votes-20171012/\">he Math Behind Gerrymandering and Wasted Votes</a>, Patrick Honner, Quanta Magazine.
