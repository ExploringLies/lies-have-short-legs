It makes a reference to what would be the failed effort, later that year, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/04/scott-walker/historic-recall-elections-wisconsin-cost-tens-mill/\">to recall</a> the Wisconsin Republican from office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps because Walker is now running for president, the meme has surfaced again. It said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating. Is it any wonder he&rsquo;s attacking teachers now?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no indication on the meme itself of who produced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker has denied being forced out of school. When we asked about the meme, his campaign responded by referring us to a brief <a href=\"http://youtu.be/WKmnRGwttSw\">comment</a> he made Aug. 8, 2015 at the conservative <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-tells-redstate-gathering-he-can-win-in-2016-b99553180z1-321145571.html\">RedState Gathering</a> in Atlanta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about lacking a college degree, Walker said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s simple. My senior year of college, I got a job offer from the American Red Cross. A lot of my friends who were a year or two older had degrees and no job. I had a job offer, no degree. I&#39;m pretty smart. I took the job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&#39;ll see, Walker was a senior when he left for the Red Cross. And although Walker has refused requests to release his college transcripts, there isn&#39;t evidence to back the claims in the attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>College days examined</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s what we know about the governor&#39;s college days from a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/dec/18/scott-walker-early-years/\">widely noted piece</a> we published in December 2013:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 1988, as a sophomore at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee, Walker entered a campaign for student government president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Walker&#39;s opponent, liberal John Quigley, but said Walker was qualified. A controversy ensued. Students told the Quigley campaign they&rsquo;d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings on campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newspaper responded with an election-day editorial headlined, &quot;Walker unfit.&quot; It decried his &quot;mudslinging&quot; and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers, which Walker&rsquo;s camp denied. Quigley won handily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Administrators investigated. But we found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our December 2013 article and at Walker&#39;s request, Marquette issued a statement saying Walker &quot;was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That meant that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The university also said Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette as well as when he left, and that he &quot;was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 1990, shortly before dropping out, Walker took a job in marketing and fundraising with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. It&#39;s also possible he was lured from school by politics. In fall 1990, while still living in the campus area, Walker ran against then-state Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat now in Congress, and lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two final notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> In a separate item, also published in December 2013, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/21/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-scott-walker-was-k/\">we rated False</a> a claim by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college &quot;not long after&quot; he was &quot;kicked out of student elections&quot; at Marquette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the original article was published, the Democratic Party removed the accusation from its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> As for his grade point average, Walker&rsquo;s gubernatorial campaign <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/99700384.html\">said</a> in 2010 that he had a 2.59 (on a 4.0 scale), about three-tenths of one point higher than the meme claims. But we don&#39;t know for sure, because he has refused to release his transcripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, when Walker said in February 2015 at the Conservative Political Action Conference that he had &quot;unsealed&quot; his college records, we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/12/scott-walker/where-are-scott-walkers-student-records/\">rated his claim False</a>. He had authorized Marquette to issue the statements we noted, but he has not released his transcripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Internet meme says Walker &quot;had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker left school as a senior for a job with the Red Cross, but has not released his transcripts, which has left some to question the move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no evidence, however, to prove the grade point average, &quot;was asked to leave&quot; or the cheating parts of the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For more on Scott Walker, check out the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Scott Walker File</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-10T14:48:14.752986", "ruling_date": "2015-08-11T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Meme claims Scott Walker 'was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating'", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-was-asked-leave-marquette-university-", "ruling_link_text": "Available evidence shows he left on his own, in good standing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4164388833523&amp;set=a.1681784609969.2094799.1398188310&amp;type=1&amp;theater\">Scott Walker meme</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Scott Walker campaign spokeswoman Stacy Day, Aug. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/WKmnRGwttSw\">video</a> (quote at 26:00) of Scott Walker remarks at Red State, Aug. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/dec/18/scott-walker-early-years/\">&quot;Solving the &#39;mystery&#39; of Scott Walker&#39;s college years and entry into politics,&quot;</a> Dec. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/12/scott-walker/where-are-scott-walkers-student-records/\">&quot;Scott Walker says he unsealed his records from college: False,&quot;</a> March 12, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 14, "current_job": "Social media posting", "false_count": 18, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 1486, "last_name": "Facebook posts", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "facebook-posts", "pants_count": 37, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Facebook_icon_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1486/", "total_count": 101, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Scott Walker &quot;had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a meme", "statement_date": "2015-08-11", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
