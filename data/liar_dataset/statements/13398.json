That&rsquo;s pretty close to the $8,000 mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that math ignores the work Feingold did outside of class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the campaign, &nbsp;Feingold graded term papers, prepared for each lecture and held office hours for two hours a week for both classes. He also gave lectures for the campus and was a guest lecturer in other courses, according to the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larry Kramer was the Law School&rsquo;s dean at the time and said he recruited Feingold for the expertise Feingold could offer the university and its students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold was a U.S. senator from 1993 to 2011, after <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/106580463.html\">losing the 2010 election to Johnson</a>. He soon became the United States Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo at the State Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kramer said Feingold&rsquo;s duties included teaching but also many other responsibilities. (Kramer gave $2,000 last year to Feingold&rsquo;s campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that the university does not pay per lecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course we don&#39;t pay that way,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody gets paid that way at the university. We don&rsquo;t even think about it that way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stanford wouldn&rsquo;t comment on its compensation programs, including whether pay is at all tied to the number of classes or lectures taught.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Brad Hayward, senior director of strategic communications at the university, confirmed that Feingold had responsibilities outside of the lectures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The responsibilities of teaching at Stanford do involve significant work outside of in-class time,&quot; Hayward wrote in an email. &quot;In addition to those teaching responsibilities, Mr. Feingold guest-lectured in other classes, delivered a public lecture, and was available to students and colleagues as a member of our academic community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our rating</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson claims Feingold &quot;got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the math may be right, or close to it, the claim implies that the number of lectures is somehow tied to pay grade and ignores the other work required outside of class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ad0a1329-e0f2-4d66-a1df-a5b93e6ca2c4\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ad0a1329-e0f2-4d66-a1df-a5b93e6ca2c4</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-01T17:13:58.150036", "ruling_date": "2016-11-02T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ron Johnson: Opponent Russ Feingold \"got paid $8,000 a lecture at Stanford University.\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "ron-johnson-opponent-russ-feingold-got-paid-8000-l", "ruling_link_text": "Well, the lectures and preparation and office hours and ...", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ron Johnson campaign ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://hands\">Hands</a>,&quot;
