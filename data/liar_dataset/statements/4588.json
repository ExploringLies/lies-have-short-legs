Rick Perry wasn&rsquo;t always a Republican.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis opponents like to remind him of that, as Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann did in a Republican presidential primary debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. And Perry likes to respond that another notable Republican once had a &quot;D&quot; behind his name too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I, like most people in the state of Texas and those southern states, grew up a Democrat. Michael Reagan and I were talking just the other day, Charlie, that I came to the Republican Party sooner in age than his dad, Ronald Reagan, did,&quot; Perry told debate moderator Charlie Rose on Oct. 11, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry said something similar to conservative commentator Sean Hannity during a radio appearance in August 2011. His words then, also repeated from a conversation with the former president&rsquo;s son: &quot;I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Texas <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/06/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-switched-gop-younger-age-reagan/\">checked it out</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to biographer Edward Yager, Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, &quot;was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYager said that he hadn&rsquo;t seen copies of Reagan&rsquo;s voter registration cards but that &quot;virtually all the sources that refer to&quot; Reagan&rsquo;s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe remained a Democrat even as he supported Republican presidential candidates, according to Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan&rsquo;s presidential library.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe library&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.reaganfoundation.org/life-and-times.aspx\">website </a>says Reagan made the switch and registered Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Perry, born March 4, 1950, he won his first three political races for a Texas House seat as a Democrat, then switched parties in 1989 to challenge a Democratic agricultural commissioner.
