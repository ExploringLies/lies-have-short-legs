Those are the things I find most important in deciding where to live.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Casselberry is a real city, located ten miles north of downtown Orlando. But it isn&#39;t the Oscar winner&rsquo;s new hometown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time DiCaprio is quoted as saying this, though, nor is Casselberry the celebrity&rsquo;s only alleged haven from the L.A. lifestyle. Fake news sites have announced DiCaprio&rsquo;s moves to <a href=\"http://www.wcrk35.com/gilroy/leonardo-dicaprio-explains-why-hes-moving-to-gilroy-california-2/\">Gilroy, Calif.</a>, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/leonardo-dicaprio-woodstock-illinois/\">Woodstock, Ill.</a>, <a href=\" http://1047kissfm.iheart.com\">Temple, Ariz.</a>, <a href=\"http://banana1015.com/the-real-story-behind-leonardo-dicaprio-moving-to-warren-michigan/\">Warren, Mich.</a>, <a href=\"http://q102.iheart.com/onair/jared-56352/alist-actor-moving-to-south-jersey-14613031/\">Swedesboro, N.J.</a>, and even to small towns overseas, including <a href=\"http://kbc14.com/naas-ireland/578/\">Naas</a> in Ireland and <a href=\"http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/lifestyle/fun-stuff/9-funny-things-people-said-11009167\">Guilford</a> in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stories appear on a chain of websites that seem to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. The sites&rsquo; names sound like official media outlets, like &quot;WCRK 35&quot; or &quot;Q 102.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. We previously <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/06/blog-posting/celebrity-praise-helpful-locals-are-fake-stories-c/\">debunked</a> a fake news story that celebrities&rsquo; cars were breaking down in small towns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every version of these stories is almost identical, though, with a different town name.The other element that sometimes changes is the name of the celebrity leaving L.A. in search of &quot;good, decent people&quot; who care about their community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you believe these Internet rumors, you will find that Will Ferrell is moving to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Rhythm1059/posts/1598728110161001:0\">Yuba City, Calif.</a>;&nbsp;Ben Affleck to <a href=\"http://www.miznercc.org/what-hollywood-actor-will-soon-be-calling-delray-beach-home/\">Delray Beach, Fla.</a>;&nbsp;Miley Cyrus to <a href=\"http://y107.com/no-miley-cyrus-not-coming-sedalia/\">Sedalia, Mo</a>.;&nbsp;Eminem to <a href=\"http://kfl3.com/rocklin-california/eminem-explains-why-hes-moving-to-rocklin-california-5/\">Rocklin, Calif.</a>;&nbsp;Scarlett Johansson to <a href=\"http://softrock989.iheart.com/onair/teri-ann-26518/scarlett-johansson-is-moving-to-clovis-14580449/\">Clovis, Calif.</a>;&nbsp;Matt Damon to <a href=\"http://www.krtv.com/story/35332951/bogus-article-claims-matt-damon-is-moving-to-montana\">Missoula, Mont.</a>;&nbsp;and Bill Murray to <a href=\"http://www.kcst7.com/salisbury-massachusetts/bill-murray-explains-why-hes-moving-to-salisbury-massachusetts/\">Salisbury, Mass.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, there is no evidence any of these celebs are packing their bags and heading to your suburb any time soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there is no banner on this or any of the other posts announcing they are fake, a <a href=\"http://www.kbr31.com/disclaimer/\">disclaimer</a> on the website announces that kbr31.com is a satirical and fantasy website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;None of the articles on kbr31.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes,&quot;
