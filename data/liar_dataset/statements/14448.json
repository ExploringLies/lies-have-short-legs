The post included this tweet from conservative writer Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That part, at least, is accurate, as D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s link to the Southern Poverty Law Center showed. Kessler has said he <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/jason-kessler\">changed ideologies near the end of 2013</a>. But that&rsquo;s about all in the story that&rsquo;s true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said Kessler was the person accused of being &quot;the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road.&quot; That&rsquo;s not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlottesville police arrested James Alex Fields Jr. for driving his car into a crowd of liberal protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 more people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been several fake news stories <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/puppetstringnewscom/charlottesville-hit-and-run-driver-was-anti-fascis/\">attempting to shift</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/puppetstringnewscom/post-wrongly-says-charlottesville-police-arrested-/\">the blame for the killing</a> or <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/alex-jones/infowars-alex-jones-falsely-says-george-soros-hill/\">suggesting Democrats were</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/18/blog-posting/blog-posts-wrongly-say-theres-proof-democrats-hire/\">behind the protests</a>. This attempt to put the blame on Kessler included the assertion in the post that he visited Obama in the White House in 2016, including the crude Photoshopped image at the top of this page with the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That photo is actually a White House image from 2011, showing actor Will Ferrell <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2058737/Michelle-Barack-Obama-pictured-Hollywood-stars-American-icons-man-inside-balloon-latest-batch-candid-photos-White-House-photographer.html\">visiting Obama in the Oval Office</a> (Ferrell&rsquo;s wife Viveca Paulin has been cropped out):</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAnd while the story attempted to demonize liberals by drawing lines between Democrats and Nazis, the source of the story is a website that makes up its content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post first appeared <a href=\"http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/08/white-supremacist-who-killed-protester-is-a-democrat-and-visited-obama-in-oval-office/\">Aug. 15 on OurLandOfTheFree.com</a>, a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we&rsquo;ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site&rsquo;s creators &quot;make no guarantee that what you read here is true.
