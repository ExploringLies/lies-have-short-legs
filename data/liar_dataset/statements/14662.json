Ted Cruz, famous and infamous for his 2013 filibuster-like talk-a-thon that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9O1pbFjj4o\">included his reading</a> a Dr. Seuss story to his daughters&nbsp;watching from home, no longer favors preserving a rule that makes it hard to stop filibusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the Texas senator flip-flop? We inquired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 100-person Senate, a filibuster (<a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm\">from a Dutch word</a> meaning pirate) can&rsquo;t be broken unless the senator in the spotlight gives way or foes raise 60 votes to invoke &quot;cloture,&quot; bringing debate to a close. Senators set that threshold, which breaks out to a three-fifths majority, in 1975. For decades before, according to a <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm\">Senate web page</a>, it had taken a two-thirds vote to invoke cloture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz, a Republican lawyer, said in 2015 he wouldn&rsquo;t support elimination of the 60-vote hurdle--even to advance his goal of repealing the Obamacare law put in place by Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a Roll Call <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/ted-cruz-preserve-the-filibuster-even-for-obamacare-repeal\">news story</a>, Cruz initially told Heritage Action&rsquo;s Jan. 12, 2015, policy summit that Republicans should do &quot;everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare.&quot; But, the story said, Cruz said afterward he believed Senate Republicans, while in the majority, shouldn&rsquo;t eliminate the filibuster as a tactic to get more legislation to then-President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, we should not,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;We should preserve the procedural protections in the Senate for the rights of the minority.&quot; Cruz then borrowed an analogy used by the framers of the Constitution by saying the Senate is &quot;like the saucer under the tea cup to cool deliberations, and I think those checks and balances were inspired. And one of the ways to limit rash decision-making is the requirement in the Senate of a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2017, though, according to a Texas Tribune <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2017/09/30/facing-texas-loyalists-cruz-grapples-gop-inaction-under-trump/\">news story</a>, Cruz said at a Texas tea-party forum that he&rsquo;s changed his mind and now favors an end to the 60-vote threshold to end a filibuster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the forum, the story says, Cruz was asked whether, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/07/18/trump-calls-for-vote-threshold-senate-but-wouldn-have-mattered-for-health-care/XFj9hnm43hNUOqvMnfJstO/story.html\">like President Donald Trump</a>, he supports ending the filibuster rule. The story said Cruz called for ending the filibuster rule, acknowledging it is an &quot;issue on which I&rsquo;ve changed my mind over the last five years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Cruz spokesman Phil Novack if Cruz&rsquo;s position had changed. Yes, Novack replied, pointing us by email to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NETarrantTeaParty/videos/10154845768420906/\">Facebook-posted video </a>of the Sept. 30, 2017, NE Tarrant Tea Party meeting where Cruz was asked about eliminating the 60-vote threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the meeting, Cruz replied, to applause: &quot;Long and short out of it, I would end the 60-vote filibuster right now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His answer went on:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt\">&quot;Now let me give you some context on that because that&rsquo;s actually an issue on which I&rsquo;ve changed my mind over the last five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt\">&quot;So if you&rsquo;d asked me five years ago, I would have had a different answer. &nbsp;And the reason is as follows: I think over time, the 60-vote threshold for legislation has had a small &lsquo;c&rsquo; conservative effect in that it has slowed down the operation of Congress. Since World War II, we&rsquo;ve had three Democratic super-majorities: the first gave us the New Deal; the second gave us the Great Society; the third gave us Obamacare and Dodd-Frank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt\">&quot;So, getting rid of the filibuster means any time there&rsquo;s a Democratic majority, you have a Democratic supermajority. So a lot of bad legislation would pass without the 60-vote threshold. So, if you&rsquo;d asked me five years ago, I would have said no, I don&rsquo;t think we should get rid of it because it slows down bad legislation at a time when the Democrats are in control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt\">&quot;Why have I changed my mind? Because I don&rsquo;t believe Democrats will be bound by it. I ...think the next time the Democrats have a majority, particularly with a Democratic president, I think they&rsquo;ll end the filibuster in a hurry. So if I believed it were a credible threat, that it actually would restrain Democrats in the future, then I might well support keeping it now. I don&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz&rsquo;s reply closed with a comment including a word we couldn&rsquo;t make out: &quot;I think it&rsquo;s stupid that it&rsquo;s a one-way (unintelligible), that it only limits us, it doesn&rsquo;t limit them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz once favored keeping the 60-vote requirement to end a Senate filibuster.
