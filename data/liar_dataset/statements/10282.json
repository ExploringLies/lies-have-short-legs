We&rsquo;re forever incorporating Nazi things into our lives. Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis! I don&rsquo;t particularly like anything the Nazis did too much, and they were the first ones to put fluoride in the water. They tell us, &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s for your teeth&rsquo; and all that &mdash; well, isn&rsquo;t that your parents&rsquo; job, to teach you how to brush your teeth and use mouthwash? Why do you need the government putting some type of chemical in your water? I don&rsquo;t know if you know this [but] fluoride is the main component of Prozac! What you&rsquo;ve got is people drinking Prozac-water. Well, what does Prozac do to you? It calms you and dumbs you down so you&rsquo;re less emotional. There&rsquo;s a reason for all that stuff; what do we need fluoride in our water for? There&rsquo;s no reason whatsoever to put chemicals in our water.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ventura&rsquo;s answer offers us a lot to analyze, but one of his claims -- that &quot;fluoride in the water ... was originally done by the Nazis&quot; -- stood out out to us because PolitiFact Florida<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/oct/06/critics-water-fluoridation/truth-about-fluoride-doesnt-include-nazi-myth/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>debunked this precise claim in 2011</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nazis, who killed millions of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, were known for chemical tests and inhumane medical experiments. Far be it from us to defend them, even in a minor way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after tracking down the roots of claims about fluoride on the Web, reaching out to Holocaust historians, contacting well-known critics of water fluoridation, and reading book excerpts, magazine articles, and news stories, we concluded that there&#39;s no teeth to this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a national celebrity now making the claim, we decided to put it in the spotlight again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ventura, through a publicist, said he doesn&#39;t remember the exact source of the claim but added that he found out about it when he did a show on water conspiracies for his show on the TruTV network. He provided a link to an<a href=\"http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2008/011508_fluoride_horror.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>article on prisonplanet.com</u></a>, a site run by Alex Jones, a broadcaster who<a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/about-alex-jones/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>describes himself</u></a> as a &quot;prominent figure of the 9/11 Truth Movement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If those facts are false, then the information we received when doing research for the water conspiracy episode was wrong,&quot; Ventura told PolitiFact in an email. &quot;Regardless of if the Nazis did it or not, I don&#39;t think we should have it in our water. You don&#39;t need the government putting chemicals in the water. It&#39;s your responsibility to brush your teeth and use mouthwash. I haven&#39;t had a house yet with fluoridated water.&quot; (He&rsquo;s only used well water.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in reading a critique of Ventura&rsquo;s claim that &quot;fluoride is the main component of Prozac,&quot;<a href=\"http://www.ilikemyteeth.org/fibbing-fluoride/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>here&rsquo;s one</u></a> by the American Academy of Pediatrics. For this fact-check, though, we&rsquo;ll stick to the claim about the Nazis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll begin by noting that this fact-check won&#39;t explore the pros and cons of fluoride in your drinking water. The<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</u></a> calls the practice one of the greatest public health achievements of the century; at the same time, groups of citizens, scientists among them, have been wary of the practice since the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we originally fact-checked this claim, we contacted historian Patricia Heberer-Rice of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, whose expertise is the German medical community, including Holocaust-era experimentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Nazi medical experiments, she told us, had two themes: new drugs and treatments for common battlefield ailments, from war wounds to typhus, and the more infamous effort to underpin Nazi racial ideas, such as<a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007060\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Josef Mengele&#39;s twin studies</u></a>. None of the experimentation that she knows of involved fluoride, either for mind control or for healthy teeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the concentration camp system, as in the ghettos, it would have been surprising if fluoride delivery was a focus &mdash; in the final few days before liberation, water lines scarcely delivered water. So, would water have been treated just for the Jews?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t see it,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she had heard a similar Cold War-era theory. It wasn&#39;t about the Nazis fluoridating water. It was the Communists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We re-connected with Heberer-Rice for this fact-check, and she told us that no additional evidence supporting Ventura&rsquo;s claim had emerged in the three years since our last fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The first mass fluoridation of drinking water was carried out by the U.S. Public Health Service on a trial basis in certain regions of this country in 1945, with its rapid extension in 1950,&quot; she said. &quot;The first interest of German scientists in this approach was in 1949&quot; -- that is, years after the Nazis had been deposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, do an Internet search for &quot;fluoride&quot; and &quot;Nazis,&quot; and you&#39;ll find articles such as &quot;<a href=\"http://truth11.com/2009/12/01/nazi-connections-to-flouride-in-americas-drinking-water/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nazi Connections to Fluoride in America&#39;s Drinking Water</u></a>.&quot; The text appears on various sites, and includes the citations &quot;Stephen 1995,&quot; and &quot;Bryson 2004.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stephen 1995&quot; is presumably Ian E. Stephens, author of a 1987 self-published booklet, an extract of which was published in <em>Nexus Magazine</em> in 1995 under the title &quot;Fluoridation: Mind Control for the Masses?&quot; We tracked down a copy of the article from the magazine&#39;s website, an alternative Australian publication covering, among other things, &quot;suppressed news, free energy, religious revisionism, conspiracy, the environment, history and ancient mysteries, the mind, UFOs, paranormal and the unexplained.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual&#39;s power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him,&quot; says a document quoted in the excerpt. &quot;Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Bryson 2004&quot; is Christopher Bryson, an investigative reporter and television producer who reported on Guatemalan human rights abuses for the BBC World Service, National Public Radio and the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> in the 1980s, and later wrote a book called <em>The Fluoride Deception</em>. It delves into murky connections between military-industrial fluoride polluters and the early push for public water fluoridation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even Bryson -- a backer of certain conspiracies involving fluoridation -- isn&rsquo;t convinced by the Nazi connection. His book mentions Nazis or Nazism fewer than 10 times, and none of the references discuss water fluoridation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I never came across any documentation or credible information showing that fluoride was used in Nazi death camps,&quot; he told us in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, two scientists published a book called <em>The Fluoride Wars: How a Modest Public Health Measure Became America&#39;s Longest Running Political Melodrama</em>. The book presents a lively social history of the fluoridation debate in the United States, starting with the fluoridation of the water in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hydrologists dedicate more than 30 pages to conspiracy theories and their origins. We contacted one of the co-authors in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The World War II death camp statement is an absurd lie,&quot; said Jay Lehr, who has authored or co-authored more than 30 books, most of them self-described &quot;boring science books for scientists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Paul Connett -- a chemist who directs the anti-fluoridation group<a href=\"http://www.fluoridealert.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Fluoride Action Network</u></a> and recently co-authored a book called <em>The Case Against Fluoride</em> -- told us in 2011 that the Nazi angle is something that he&rsquo;s been steering people in his movement away from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have done our level best to discourage opponents of fluoridation from using this emotive argument,&quot; Connett said. &quot;The historical evidence for this assertion is extremely weak. It is sad that the U.S. media has done such a bad job of educating the public on this issue that it is so easy for crazy ideas to fill the vacuum.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ventura said, &quot;Fluoride in the water, that was originally done by the Nazis!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two book authors who researched the topic, one a journalist, the other a hydrologist, found no credible evidence of such a connection. A leading anti-fluoridation activist repudiates the story. The most commonly cited Web source for the story was a 16-year-old extract in a fringe Australian publication. And a Holocaust historian we contacted knew of no such project. This claim remains Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note:</strong> This report initially referred to Ventura as a Navy SEAL, something he includes on his&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.ora.tv/offthegrid\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>ora.tv biograph</em>y</u></a><em>.
