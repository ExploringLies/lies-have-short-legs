Now you have a presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. Will you support him?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ryan:</strong> Well, to be perfectly candid with you, Jake, I&rsquo;m just not ready to do that at this point. I&rsquo;m not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party. And I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moments later, there was a follow-up question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Tapper:</strong> So you&rsquo;re saying you can&rsquo;t support or endorse him right now?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ryan: </strong>Yes, I am basically saying that &hellip;.But at this point, I think that he needs do more to unify this party to bring all wings of the Republican Party together ...</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty clearly a partial change in position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan invited Trump to meet Tuesday, May 10, with Republican House leaders, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is expected to meet that day with Ryan and Trump, according to a statement from Ryan&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan has said repeatedly he would support for president whomever wins the Republican nomination.
