Dianne Feinstein of California:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Virtually every Democrat has said there is no collusion. There is no collusion. .&thinsp;.&thinsp;. I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day&nbsp;on television saying there is no collusion.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, two of the three congressional panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, a statement from Feinstein declaring &quot;no collusion,&quot; would be significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was this another false claim or was there some truth to Trump&rsquo;s words?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A White House spokesman did not respond to our request for evidence backing up Trump&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The president, however, was apparently referring to Feinstein&rsquo;s Nov. 5, 2017 interview with CNN&rsquo;s Jake Tapper in which she discussed the Russia investigation but never flatly said there&rsquo;s no collusion. As NPR reported in a similar <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/29/574504669/fact-check-trumps-new-york-times-interview-on-russia-taxes-health-care-and-more\">fact check</a>, Feinstein&rsquo;s interview took place &quot;following the guilty plea of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. Charging documents described conversations Papadopoulos had with Russian-linked individuals where he was promised &lsquo;dirt&rsquo; on Hillary Clinton, as well as hacked emails.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the CNN interview, Tapper asked Feinstein whether she had &quot;seen any evidence that this dirt, these emails, were ever given to the Trump campaign.&quot; Feinstein replied: &quot;Not so far.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T52OoQcWUjg?start=50\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sen. Feinstein&#39;s interview on CNN</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapper then asked: &quot;Have you seen any communications that suggested that the Trump campaign wanted them to release them through a different means?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein answered: &quot;I have not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The senator&rsquo;s words were in response to a specific portion of the Russia investigation. They are not the same as saying &quot;there is no collusion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein spoke more generally about collusion during an Oct. 8, 2017 <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-sen-dianne-feinstein-on-face-the-nation-oct-8-2017/\">CBS interview</a>, saying she did not know whether it had taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s an open question because there&#39;s no proof yet that it&#39;s happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller&#39;s investigation,&quot; Feinstein said referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, again, Feinstein did not say there is no collusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Mentzer, Feinstein&rsquo;s spokesman, said he was not aware of the senator ever making such a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein is running for re-election in 2018 and is being challenged by State Senate Leader Kevin de Le&oacute;n, also a Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Similar Trump claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2017, Trump made a similar mischaracterization. He tweeted that former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper &quot;and virtually everyone else&quot; said &quot;there is no collusion&quot; in the Russia investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National found Trump twisted Clapper&rsquo;s words from a March 2017 interview in which Clapper said he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In response to Trump&rsquo;s tweet, Clapper later said: &quot;I don&rsquo;t know if there was collusion or not,&quot; and that he did not believe the probe is &quot;a witch hunt.&quot; PolitiFact rated Trump&rsquo;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/12/donald-trump/trumps-mostly-false-claim-clapper-said-no-collusio/\">Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Trump recently claimed Sen. Feinstein said &quot;there is no collusion,&quot; between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He apparently based his statement on responses Feinstein gave in a November 2017 CNN interview about the Russia probe. While Feinstein said she had &quot;not so far&quot; seen specific evidence about one portion of the investigation, that&rsquo;s far from declaring there was no collusion. Speaking &nbsp;more broadly about whether collusion took place, Feinstein said in an October 2017 interview that it&#39;s &quot;an open question.&quot; The president&rsquo;s claim distorted the senator&rsquo;s words and gave the wrong impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate&nbsp;Trump&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-02T20:03:06.825019", "ruling_date": "2018-01-02T17:31:04", "ruling_headline": "Trump\u2019s False claim Dianne Feinstein said \u2018there is no collusion\u2019 ", "ruling_headline_slug": "trumps-false-claim-dianne-feinstein-said-there-no-", "ruling_link_text": "Feinstein said collusion is \"open question\"", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>The New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/us/politics/fact-check-trump-interview.html\">10 Falsehoods From Trump&#39;s Interview With The Times</a>, Dec. 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/politics/trump-interview-excerpts.html\">Excerpts From Trump&#39;s Interview With The Times - The New York Times</a>, Dec. 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/29/574504669/fact-check-trumps-new-york-times-interview-on-russia-taxes-health-care-and-more\">FACT CHECK: Trump&#39;s &#39;New York Times&#39; Interview On Russia, Taxes, Health Care And More</a>, Dec. 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/12/29/in-a-30-minute-interview-president-trump-made-24-false-or-misleading-claims/?utm_term=.9b523619df67\">In a 30-minute interview, President Trump made 24 false or misleading claims</a>, Dec. 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Toronto Star</em>, <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/analysis/2017/12/29/donald-trump-made-25-false-claims-in-his-latest-new-york-times-interview.html\">Donald Trump made 25 false claims in his latest New York Times interview</a>, Dec. 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daily Caller, <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/05/dianne-feinstein-says-she-still-hasnt-seen-evidence-of-collusion-video/\">Dianne Feinstein Says She Still Hasn&rsquo;t Seen Evidence Of Collusion [VIDEO]</a>, Nov. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBSnews.com, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-sen-dianne-feinstein-on-face-the-nation-oct-8-2017/\">Transcript: Sen.
