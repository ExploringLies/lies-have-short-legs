Also, Staples&rsquo; cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridge&rsquo;s overall results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and he&rsquo;s never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agency&rsquo;s savings &quot;helped&quot; achieve the results. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want to get popped for something I&rsquo;ve never taken credit for,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Operation Drawbridge</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its <a href=\"http://www.dps.texas.gov/PublicInformation/operDrawbrdg.htm\"><u>website</u></a>. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor&rsquo;s Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, <em>San Antonio Express-News</em><a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/New-frontier-for-DPS-is-stopping-smuggling-3622092.php\"> <u>news story</u></a> said, &quot;(T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It&#39;s an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2013 DPS <a href=\"https://www.preparingtexas.org/Resources/documents/2013%20Conference%20Presentations/Drawbridge%20Presentation_HLS%20conf.pdf\"><u>conference presentation</u></a> placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HpVGyTtHY3HRU6b6J19UKnaCd8yPE5UwlVAeozAN7BXlzJ_mjSojBhlIiCA_2L7THCVHWx_whUv_73SFxVlyZEbESsa9l8pzaSALV9NrqoKey4IPLqLQ1UlE0g\" style=\"width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BDzmEmrbXg3D9sQbzyMHHfgcomZ7MWIqrCLEO9S_11EznCxfQByrKD8jlISQqVqVb-B8ZYapA399ugklTAMkY8kRKX1CmiFg7jhDVENctltezi8hMT8I2PIcmQ\" style=\"width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Images from 2013 <a href=\"https://www.preparingtexas.org/Resources/documents/2013%20Conference%20Presentations/Drawbridge%20Presentation_HLS%20conf.pdf\"><u>conference presentation</u></a> on DPS website preparingtexas.org </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege.
