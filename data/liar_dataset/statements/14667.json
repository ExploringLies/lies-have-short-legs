Don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo was posted on the Facebook page Wake Up America and has over 2,700 shares. Red text on the photo purports it is Huckabee Sanders in Little Rock, Ark., on Halloween 1993. But it&rsquo;s not. A reader asked us to look into the post to verify its accuracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo shows a child who appears to be younger than Huckabee Sanders; she would have been 11. The person in the photo also does not <a href=\"https://www.obu.edu/politicalpapers/mike-huckabee-biography/\">resemble </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliusIrvington/status/555135832835629056\">known</a> childhood photos of Huckabee Sanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, this photo already has been discredited on Snopes after it <a href=\"http://www.freewoodpost.com/2012/08/11/chick-fil-a-president-dan-cathy-we-dont-like-the-blacks-either/\">appeared</a> on the satirical site FreeWoodPost.com in August 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sloppily photoshopped Chick-fil-A sign had then been layered over the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/12VN7LUtXFxCLrfVgFdFLl4zovozL90za2x_KM9TDl984XHDZtViJwFvK2muh4gY-Jl4QaKhrBw4VaA582_CxB--D6Syyc1yoMAvWllcBL4OJ5l9XMic4d-npC9L9rvEUw7_dltx\" style=\"height:451px; width:302px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That image accompanied a fake news story that purported Dan Cathy, the company&rsquo;s president, had called for a racist controversy to stir up sales. The post followed <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/02/huckabee-chick-fil-appreciation-day-beyond-anything-could-have-imagined.html\">news</a> that counter-protests to Cathy&rsquo;s opposition to gay marriage had caused a record spike in sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s milk this for all its worth,&quot; the fake news story credited Cathy as saying. &quot;Let&rsquo;s wait until this gay thing dies down a little, then I will release another statement that says that we don&rsquo;t like blacks either.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cathy confirmed to Snopes the marketing ploy was fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found versions of this same image appearing as far back as <a href=\"https://streetknowledge.nyc/2008/04/10/\">2008</a>, including on a <a href=\"https://dezinfo.net/foto/2717-modeler-dlya-ku-kluks-klana-15-foto.html\">Russian blog</a> dezinfo.net. The Russian blog says the photos are part of a story of a woman who has been sewing KKK uniforms &quot;for many years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That appears to track back to a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2008/03/aryan-outfitters-kkk-seamstress/\">Mother Jones photo essay</a> of &quot;Ms. Ruth,&quot; who reportedly &quot;sews hoods and robes for Klan members seven days a week, blessing each one when it&rsquo;s done.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo essay, by New York photojournalist Anthony Karen, includes a photo of the same child.
