The evidence clearly points to Ukraine&rsquo;s Russian separatists, who have already shot down 12 Ukrainian military planes, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry&rsquo;s cache of evidence included a flow of major weapons (including tanks and rocket launchers) from Russia to the rebels over the past month. And he says the Russians trained the rebels to use an SA-11 missile launcher like the one used to shoot down MH 17. Additionally, an SA-11 passed through the area where the launch originated in the past couple of days, but it did not belong to Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To top it off, the separatists have implicated themselves, Kerry claimed. Intelligence <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbyZYgSXdyw\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>intercepted conversations</u></a> among separatists talking about knocking down a plane. And one separatist leader allegedly bragged on social media about shooting down a plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We know that very shortly (after the crash), separatists were bragging in the social media about having shot down a transport plane,&quot; Kerry said on <em>Fox News Sunday</em>. &quot;We know that the so-called defense minister of the People&#39;s Republic of Donetsk, Mr. Igor Strelkov, actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While much of Kerry&rsquo;s evidence relies on intelligence that the public can&rsquo;t access, we can fact-check his claim that a rebel leader posted on social media about shooting down a plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We quickly found this screenshot of a post from Strelkov&rsquo;s social media profile -- allegedly the smoking gun -- that has made its way around the Internet since Thursday:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9fuZ86bxqTH5yECZAWqf6sCJRK6P3xtZQ50m9ybu8TzI_b01z2WYZ6B3MGCjIL3wWU8_KyAauZ6UqfWfPtaOrvcXlxatCF9enGplupcaTdiNzy2pmnh5hg7kdB-YOSK3OQ\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:334px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:389px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post has since been deleted. But the Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine -- which periodically saves versions of websites -- <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140717152222/http://vk.com/strelkov_info\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>shows the post</u></a> did appear on Strelkov&rsquo;s page at one point, so we know it was it was a real post. But does it indicate that the rebels are behind the attack like Kerry said. First, some background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is Igor Strelkov?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Igor Strelkov is the rebel commander of Ukraine&rsquo;s pro-Kremlin forces and an alleged former Russian intelligence agent. His real name is Igor Girkin (Strelkov is Russian for &quot;gunman&quot;), and he&rsquo;s also called &quot;Igor the Terrible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strelkov is a shadowy figure. He is a veteran of the Russian military, having fought in post-Soviet conflicts in Transnistria, Serbia and Chechnya, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/world/europe/russian-seizes-authority-over-ukraine-rebels.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><em><u>New York Times</u></em><u>.</u></a> Kiev leadership believes Strelkov currently works for Russian military intelligence -- taken by some as proof of Russia&rsquo;s assistance in the separatist uprising, according to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27211501\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>BBC reports</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strelkov last legally crossed into Ukraine from Russia on Feb. 26 of this year. In an interview with the&nbsp;Russian tabloid&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://storify.com/ystriya/interview-with-gru-officer-igor-strelkov\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Komsomolskaya Pravda</u></a></em>, he admitted to participating in the conflicts in Crimea in the spring and in Slovyansk in April. There, he was named the commander of the rebel forces of the Donetsk People&#39;s Republic -- the separatists&rsquo; self-proclaimed state in eastern Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/world/europe/russian-seizes-authority-over-ukraine-rebels.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The New York Times</u></a></em> describes him as an &quot;iron-fisted&quot; solo operator, who has openly criticized the Kremlin for not providing aid to the rebels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strelkov wrote for the right-wing Russian nationalist newspaper <em>Zavtra</em> <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/whos-who-in-the-donetsk-peoples-republic\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>in the 1990s</u></a>, and he is a war re-enactment enthusiast. Bloggers have discovered photos of him dressed in <a href=\"http://bmpd.livejournal.com/830579.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>period military costumes</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do we know about his post?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. State Department confirmed that the post pictured above is the one Kerry was referring to in his statement on Fox. The post comes from Strelkov&rsquo;s profile on <a href=\"https://vk.com/strelkov_info\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>VKontakte (VK)</u></a>, Russia&rsquo;s version of Facebook. This is a translation of the post, according to the <a href=\"http://uacrisis.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ukraine Crisis Media Center</u></a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">17.07.2014 17:50 (Moscow time)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">In the region of Torez AN-26 plane has been shot, it is somewhere near the &lsquo;Progress&rsquo; mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">We have warned them &ndash; not to fly &lsquo;in our sky.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">Here is video-proof of yet another &lsquo;bird fall.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">The bird has fallen behind the (waste heap), it missed the residential quarters. Peaceful citizens were not hurt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also included two videos showing some sort of explosion from a distance that are similar to other videos of the MH 17 aftermath. One of the videos is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UufhL4riCQ\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>still on YouTube</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting the idea that the post was referring to MH 17, it went up at 5:50 p.m. local time, which was about a half hour after MH 17 went down. It says the plane went down in Torez, which is just a few miles south of the MH 17 crash site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post says, though, that the rebels shot down an AN-26, which is a military transport plane about one-third the length of a Boeing 777. (People in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbyZYgSXdyw\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>alleged leaked audio</u></a> of intercepted conversations also mention confusion over whether the downed plane was a civilian or AN-26.) Separatists had recently shot down at least two transport planes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the post is no longer on VK -- leading Kerry and others to the conclusion that it was deleted after Strelkov realized that it was a civilian plane, not a transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Strelkov denies involvement in the post. In a later VK post, translated for <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2014/07/18/smoking-guns-russian-separatists-shot-down-malaysian-plane/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Forbes</u></a>, Strelkov said the announcement about the transport plane going down was not an official one:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;ATTENTION. This announcement declared that the news of the downing of the AN-26 was not official but came from residents and militia members on the scene. The only official announcements are published under the banner: Strelkov INFORMS. In other words, Strelkov asks his readers to forget the earlier announcement of the successful downing of a fascist Ukrainian plane.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, he posted that Donetsk supports an objective investigation but denies involvement in the missile launch and instead blames the Ukrainian military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, some separatists in Donetsk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/489819271632281600\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>told Max Seddon</u></a>, a BuzzFeed reporter, that Streklov&rsquo;s VK page is a fake made by fans. But of course, the separatists have an incentive to distance themselves from any evidence tying them to an action that killed 300 civilians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry said, &quot;(Strelkov) posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that a post appeared on Strelkov&rsquo;s social media profile bragging about shooting down a transport plane close to the MH 17 crash site. In a subsequent post, Strelkov said the information passed along came not from him directly, but from militia members on the scene. He said the information was unofficial and incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to know with certainty Strelkov&#39;s role in the post, or when the post was pulled, but we do know that the posts come from within the separatist movement -- as Strelkov himself said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evidence is largely on Kerry&#39;s side, though there are some points that are unclear. We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-20T11:25:35.599748", "ruling_date": "2014-07-20T17:40:05", "ruling_headline": "Kerry: Ukrainian separatist 'bragged' on social media about shooting down Malaysia Flight 17", "ruling_headline_slug": "kerry-ukrainian-separatist-bragged-social-media", "ruling_link_text": "The post is there but hard to verify", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Fox News Sunday, </em>transcript, July 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN&rsquo;s <em>State of the Union, </em>transcript, July 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC&rsquo;s <em>This Week, </em>transcript, July 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internet Archive, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140717152222/http://vk.com/strelkov_info\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Wayback Machine -- Igor Strelkov profile</u></a>, accessed July 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Christian Science Monit</em><a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0717/Web-evidence-points-to-pro-Russia-rebels-in-downing-of-MH17-video\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><em>or</em>, <u>Web evidence points to pro-Russia rebels in downing of MH17 (+vi</u><u>deo)</u></a>, July 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/18/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17-q-a.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A8%22%7D\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 17</u></a>,&quot; July 19, 2014 &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Business Insider, </em>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/igor-strelkov-comments-on-malaysia-mh17-2014-7\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pro-Russian Rebel Leader: We Have Warned Them &mdash; Not To Fly In Our Sky</u></a>,&quot; July 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vox, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5913089/did-this-ukrainian-rebel-commander-take-credit-for-shooting-down-the/in/5677250\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Did Ukrainian rebels really take credit for downing MH17?</u></a>&quot; July 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vkontakte, <a href=\"http://vk.com/strelkov_info\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Igor Strelkov&rsquo;s page</u></a>, accessed July 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Embassy in Kiev, <a href=\"http://uacrisis.org/united-states-assessment-downing-flight-mh17-aftermath/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>American assessment of MH-17</u></a>, July 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ukraine Crisis Media Center, <a href=\"http://uacrisis.org/malaysia-airlines-crash/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Malaysia Airlines Crash: Pro-Russian Terrorists Caught Red-Handed</u></a>, July 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2014/07/18/smoking-guns-russian-separatists-shot-down-malaysian-plane/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Smoking Guns</u></a>,&quot; July 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/international/2014/04/140430_ukraine_donetsk_pushilin_moscow.shtml\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donetsk separatist Pushilin: Russian world unites us</u></a>, April 30, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The New York Times, </em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/world/europe/russian-seizes-authority-over-ukraine-rebels.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Shadowy Rebel Wields Iron Fist in Ukraine Fight</u></a>, July 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vice, <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/whos-who-in-the-donetsk-peoples-republic\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Who&rsquo;s Who in the Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republic</u></a>, July 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Alec Gerlach, State Department spokesman, July 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Valentyn Pugachov, Ukraine Crisis Media Center spokesman, July 20, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Secretary of State", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 65, "last_name": "Kerry", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-kerry", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnkerry.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/65/", "total_count": 14, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The so-called defense minister of the People&#39;s Republic of Donetsk ... actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport.
