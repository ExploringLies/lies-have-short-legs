We had the chance to put the question to Cain directly during his recent swing through Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Most people are going to pay less in taxes,&quot; Cain, a former pizza chain executive, said Oct. 5, 2011, aboard his campaign bus stopped in St. Petersburg. &quot;Why? Because we&#39;re expanding the base.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain told us he even worked out the math himself. Someone earning $50,000 a year would pay less in taxes under his 9-9-9 than they do under the current system, he said. Under the current system, a person who earns $50,000 a year &quot;pays about $10,000 in taxes,&quot; Cain said. &quot;A big part of that is the payroll tax.&quot; Cain then walked us through his 9-9-9 plan and said the same person would &quot;still have $2,000 left over.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I can&#39;t design a system for people who don&#39;t want to pay taxes,&quot; Cain added. &quot;I can design a system so they can get a job.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain made a similar comment Oct. 12, 2011, during an interview with MSNBC&#39;s Chuck Todd.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Today under the current system, ($50,000-a-year earners) will pay over $10,000 in taxes, assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions. I&#39;ve gone through the math. $10,000,&quot; Cain said. &quot;Now, with 9-9-9, they&#39;re going to pay that ... 9 percent tax on their income, so that&#39;s only $4,500. They still have $5,500 left over to apply to the sales tax fees. And if you go and look at what they -- how much of it they would probably spend on sales taxes for new goods -- not used. Used goods, they don&#39;t pay a sales tax. They are still going to have money left over.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to take Cain&#39;s analysis that his plan was better for someone earning $50,000 to a trio of tax accountants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we tell you the results of their analysis, here&#39;s some background on Cain&#39;s plan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t9-9-9, Cain says, is the first step to creating a national flat or &quot;fair&quot; tax. It would replace the current complicated tax system with 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent national sales tax and a 9 percent tax on businesses. Unlike the current system, Cain&#39;s plan includes relatively few opportunities for people or businesses to claim deductions or write off expenses. The personal income tax, for example, would include only two potential exemptions -- people could write off donations to charity and tax filers would get a break for living in impoverished inner cities. Cain&#39;s national sales tax would be on top of state and local sales taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this fact-check, we&#39;ll only be talking about the personal income tax and the sales tax since the business tax directly affects only business owners and corporations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain set the parameters for the $50,000 experiment during our interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor calculating the tax burden under 9-9-9, Cain assumed that the hypothetical tax filer made no charitable deductions and was not eligible for a tax credit by living in an inner city. So Cain&#39;s taxpayer paid the full 9 percent income tax on $50,000 -- or $4,500.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain then assumed every other dollar was spent on something subject to his 9 percent sales tax, meaning his hypothetical taxpayer contributed an additional $4,095 to the federal government. (Cain&#39;s 9-9-9 includes no sales tax on used goods.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s a total tax paid of $8,595 or a tax rate of 17.19 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s the maximum someone would have to contribute under 9-9-9, unless they spent more than they took in on items subject to the sales tax. Presumably they&#39;d pay less if they saved money or spent money on housing, which we assume wouldn&#39;t be subject to a sales tax. But again, we&#39;re using Cain&#39;s figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo see how that compared to the same earner under the current system, we reached out to three accountants and asked them to run the numbers. For this analysis, we&#39;re measuring the income tax and payroll taxes a worker would be asked to contribute. (Payroll taxes vanish under Cain&#39;s plan.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain&#39;s assumption in this scenario, he told us, was that the taxpayer claimed the standard exemption and nothing else.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe exercise showed one thing about the current system: It&#39;s certainly more complicated than the system Cain is proposing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>For a single person, 9-9-9 is a better deal</strong>. A single person with no dependents would pay about $10,075 in combined payroll and federal income taxes, $1,480 more than that taxpayer would pay under Cain&#39;s 9-9-9. The calculation comes with one caveat: President Barack Obama and Congress temporarily have lowered the payroll tax contribution for employees 2 percentage points, whereas these figures assume the contribution rate is restored to the full 7.65 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>For someone married with dependents, 9-9-9 is worse. </strong>The current tax code treats married couples with children differently -- and better -- than people who are single. With dependents, the family of four will pay about $6,515 in income and payroll taxes and even less, about $4,600, if they qualify for a child income tax credit. So the family of four could end up paying anywhere from about $2,080 to $4,000 more in federal taxes under Cain&#39;s 9-9-9.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese are broad strokes that can vary based on your personal situation -- as well as other credits workers might be able to claim under the current tax system -- but they&#39;re a good rough guide in understanding Cain&#39;s plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe disparity between 9-9-9 and the current tax code grows as a person&#39;s income shrinks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA single person who makes $40,000 would still pay about $334 less in federal taxes under 9-9-9. But someone making $30,000 would pay about $212 more under 9-9-9.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor families at those income levels, 9-9-9 is even worse, especially when you include potential tax credits and exemptions low-income earners are now getting that they wouldn&#39;t under Cain&#39;s plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s going to fall very, very heavily on low-income taxpayers to middle-income taxpayers,&quot; Andy Hollander, a retired federal tax agent, who studied the 9-9-9 plan for PolitiFact Florida, told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet Jonathan Kraftchick, another accountant who pored over the numbers for us, pointed out that 9-9-9 allows people to control their final tax liability based on their spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Households would be much more in control of what their final tax liabilities would be since the sales tax would effectively allow them to increase/decrease their taxes at will,&quot; Kraftchick said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone of this addresses another point. Besides what 9-9-9 might mean for you, there&#39;s also the question of what it will mean for the federal government -- namely, if it will generate enough revenue to keep the federal government in business. Cain has said the plan is meant to generate the same amount of revenue initially, but he hasn&#39;t released enough detailed information for analysts and economists to see if that&#39;s correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat discussion&#39;s for another day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere we&#39;re looking at Cain&#39;s answer when we asked how his plan would affect poorer Americans. He responded by saying that someone making $50,000 a year, which is about the median income for all U.S. households, would be better off under his plan than the current tax system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe have two major issues with his response. First, we asked about poorer Americans and he picked an income figure of $50,000 a year, which is the median income for U.S. households. There&#39;s some cherry-picking there, since the numbers change if you select $40,000 or $30,000. Moreover, while calculating the impacts of 9-9-9 might be simple, comparing them to the current tax system is much more complicated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain&#39;s assumption holds when you look at single earners, but married couples and people with children making $50,000 a year would likely pay more under 9-9-9 than the current system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe knock the claim down one mark for cherry-picking a figure of $50,000 a year and two more because the claim itself is only half right. To us, that equals a Mostly False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-13T12:11:38.843200", "ruling_date": "2011-10-13T14:49:21", "ruling_headline": "Herman Cain says someone earning $50,000 will save under his 9-9-9 tax plan", "ruling_headline_slug": "herman-cain-says-someone-earning-50000-will-save-u", "ruling_link_text": "9-9-9 is simple but comparisons to current tax code aren't", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Herman Cain in St. Petersburg, Fla., Oct. 5, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHerman Cain interview with MSNBC&#39;s Chuck Todd, Oct. 12, 2011, transcript provided via Nexis</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tHerman Cain for president, <a href=\"http://www.hermancain.com/images/economicgrowth.pdf\" id=\"c4xi\" title=\"9-9-9 Plan outline\">9-9-9 Plan outline</a>, accessed Oct. 13, 2011</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/jun/10/did-herman-cain-turn-around-godfathers-pizza/\" id=\"o8gg\" title=\"Did Herman Cain turn around Godfather's Pizza?\">Did Herman Cain turn around Godfather&#39;s Pizza?</a>&quot;
