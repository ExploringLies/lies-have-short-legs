He said workers&rsquo; starting wages would be increased to $11. He also previewed bonuses to workers ineligible for the hourly wage increase that ranged from $200 to $1,000 depending on time spent within the company.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;As you know, the president and Congress have approved a lower business tax rate,&quot; McMillon wrote. &quot;Given these changes, we have an opportunity to accelerate a few pieces of our investment plan.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform, but the law fast-tracked the process.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Wagner&rsquo;s office linked us to a January CNBC article announcing Walmart planned to distribute these raises and bonuses and that the payments were projected to start the following month. The office also sent another article from the St. Louis Business Journal about a St. Louis Walmart receiving regular bonuses because of &quot;their store&rsquo;s performance the previous quarter.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In its original announcement, Walmart said it planned to spend $400 million on one time bonuses. The company would not confirm the exact amount but said the number was close to its original projection.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Justin Rushing, the director of corporate communications for Walmart, said &quot;the raises went into effect on Feb. 17, and showed up on the paycheck our associates received on March 8.
