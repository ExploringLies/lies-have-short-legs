John Cornyn has qualms about President Barack Obama&rsquo;s nomination  of the nation&rsquo;s solicitor general, Elena Kagan, for the U.S. Supreme  Court &mdash; including her lack of bench experience.</p>\r\n<p>In a statement  issued Monday, Cornyn doesn't say he's against confirming her for the  vacancy to be left by Justice John Paul Stevens, who's retiring this  summer. But Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calls  Kagan &ldquo;a surprising choice because she lacks judicial experience. Most  Americans believe that prior judicial experience is a necessary  credential for a Supreme Court justice.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Then again, Cornyn  previously came to terms with a nominee without judicial seasoning. In  2005, he championed President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet  Miers to the court, casting the absence of a judgeship on her resume as a  woman-of-the-heartland quality. On Monday, he took issue with Kagan's  \"rarefied\" background, notable for her ties to Harvard University, where  she was a student and later the dean of its law school, and steepage in  Washington, where she was a Supreme Court clerk and, later, a White  House aide before becoming solicitor general.</p>\r\n<p>Has the junior  Republican senator from Texas reversed himself on justices needing a  background robed in black? Cornyn's comments -- then and now -- give us a  chance to test the PolitiFact Texas Flip-O-Meter.</p>\r\n<p>First, a look  back.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2005, Cornyn took the occasion of Miers'  nomination to praise the Texas lawyer then serving as a White House  adviser.</p>\r\n<p>On Oct. 3, Cornyn said: &ldquo;Some have said that perhaps we  don't know very much about her because she hasn't been a judge before,  but the fact is more than 40 Supreme Court justices were nominated and  confirmed to that position without prior judicial experience,&rdquo; according  to a transcript by the Federal News Service.</p>\r\n<p>Cornyn said that  day on PBS&rsquo;s &ldquo;NewsHour&rdquo; that 41 of 109 justices served on the court  without prior judicial experience &mdash; a ratio he rehashed in an opinion  article published two days later in the Wall Street Journal. Cornyn  wrote: &ldquo;These (previous non-judges) include several luminaries from the  school of judicial restraint, including the late Chief Justice William  Rehnquist.&rdquo; Earlier in the piece, Cornyn said &ldquo;some have criticized the  president because he did not select an Ivy-League-credentialed federal  appeals court judge for the open seat. I think this criticism is  misplaced. For one thing, there is no evidence that service on the  federal court of appeals is a prerequisite for distinguished service on  the Supreme Court&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On Oct. 27, at Miers' request, President Bush  withdrew her nomination, which was imperiled by opposition from the  right and from the left. On Monday afternoon, Salon.com posted an item  quoting from Cornyn&rsquo;s press conference that day when he was asked if  Miers&rsquo; nomination showed it&rsquo;d be almost impossible for someone to serve  on the court if they hadn't been a judge. The Dallas Morning News also  noted the contrast between Cornyn now and Cornyn then.</p>\r\n<p>According  to the Political Transcript Wire, Cornyn said he hoped not, adding that  he'd thought Miers&rsquo; qualifications, which were rooted in decades as a  Dallas lawyer, &ldquo;would fill some very important gaps in the Supreme  Court. Because right now you have people who've been federal judges,  circuit judges most of their lives, or academicians. And what you see is  a lack of grounding in reality and common sense that I think would be  very beneficial.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And what of his comments now about Kagan?</p>\r\n<p>After  issuing his statement noting Kagan's lack of judicial experience,  Cornyn told Texas reporters Monday: \"We really don't know anything about  how Ms. Kagan would perform as a judge if she was confirmed because she  has no record.\"</p>\r\n<p>Cornyn also aired several concerns about Kagan  including her decision as dean of the Harvard law school not to allow  military recruiters on campus.</p>\r\n<p>In a Tuesday interview with MSNBC, Cornyn stressed what he said is Kagan's lack of practical legal experience. Asked if he  thought Miers was more qualified than Kagan, Cornyn replied: \"Certainly,  by virtue of her practical legal experience, Ms. Miers had more  experience.\" He noted that neither one was previously a judge. He then said: \"I don't think that should be a disqualifier.\"</p>\r\n<p>His spokesman, Kevin  McLaughlin, separately suggested there's no inconsistency in Cornyn's statements  about judicial experience.</p>\r\n<p>We disagree. Cornyn wholeheartedly  praised Miers' lack of judicial experience in 2005. Now he sees such a gap as one of Kagan's weaknesses, though not (as of Tuesday) reason alone to deny her confirmation. That's at least a Half Flip.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-11T18:25:44.701224", "ruling_date": "2010-05-11T19:32:56", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
