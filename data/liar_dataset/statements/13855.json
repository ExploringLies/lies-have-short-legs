In 32 percent of counties, individuals looking to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act online marketplace have just one choice for their insurance provider, according to an <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">analysis</a> by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, last updated in November 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In several states, including Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, there&rsquo;s only one insurance provider total participating in each state&rsquo;s online marketplace in 2017. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a significant change from 2016, when just 7 percent of counties &mdash; and one state, Wyoming &mdash; were limited to one insurance provider on the online exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Wisconsin has 15 insurance providers participating in the exchanges in 2017, and Ohio has 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6Wxa_sc7Fuk_8Q150IExt89ijVVd_fELTXkOApuTew13zRXwYLTimOTuh8UCo55UDh1QHxZWXq7WsXo2cvrWhBLAZLq2wFyTQj6mpi091VZq76AOeuzERs-xjCdHIP1zhijf6pDu\" style=\"border:none; height:435px; width:580px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Trump&rsquo;s claim doesn&rsquo;t mean one-third of people have only one provider to choose from for health insurance. Because rural and sparsely populated areas tend to have lower competition, about 21 percent, or one-fifth, of exchange enrollees live in these counties where there&rsquo;s only one insurance provider to choose from, according to Kaiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So of the approximately <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-items/2017-02-03.html?DLPage=1&amp;DLEntries=10&amp;DLSort=0&amp;DLSortDir=descending\">9.2 million people</a> enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2017, about 1.9 million could only purchase insurance from one company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These individuals could still buy insurance outside the marketplace and from another provider. But if they did so, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a federal subsidy to defray the cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance companies that have dropped from the exchanges &mdash; including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/19/unitedhealth-group-to-exit-obamacare-exchanges-in-all-but-a-handful-of-states/?utm_term=.824c84cced75\">UnitedHealthGroup</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/14/humana-says-it-plans-to-pull-out-of-obamacare-exchanges-in-2018.html\">Humana</a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/24/investing/aetna-obamacare-humana-merger/\">Aetna</a> &mdash; have said they were losing money by participating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among plans offered on the exchanges, costs have gone way up. Looking at a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-under-obamacare-american-families-/\">standard measurement</a> used by the Department of Health and Human Services &mdash; what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan &mdash; average premiums for this type of plan rose by 38 percent between 2014 and 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course, everyone would like to see more competition in the marketplaces &mdash; that&#39;s important for keeping costs down,&quot; said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University&rsquo;s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. &quot;But there has always been a recognition that there would be more competition in some places than others.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glied added that individual insurance markets in many states were highly concentrated <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/market-share-and-enrollment-of-largest-three-insurers-individual-market/?activeTab=map&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=largest-insurer__market-share&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">before the Affordable Care Act, too</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;One-third of the counties &mdash; think of it, one-third &mdash; only have one insurer left.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you know that Trump is specifically talking about Affordable Care Act exchanges, Trump&rsquo;s figure checks out.
