Roy Barnes has offered a few mea culpas this year as he  tries to get his old job back.<br /><br />One key area in which Barnes has  changed course is special-interest tax breaks for various businesses. As  a member of the Georgia Legislature and later as governor, Barnes  supported more than two dozen exemptions, according to an Atlanta  Journal-Constitution story by staff writer James Salzer that ran in  Sunday's newspaper.<br /><br />Now, Barnes has said in recent campaign  speeches that many of these exemptions should be scrapped.<br /><br />\"When I  was in the Legislature, I voted for all of them. When I was governor, I  signed them,\" said Barnes, who was governor from 1999 to 2003. \"We all  have sinned and fallen short of the Lord. But when you tell everybody  the choices are between all of these exemptions and keeping teachers in  the classroom, I believe the teachers win, the children win.\"<br /><br />Has  the former governor flip-flopped on this issue? We wanted to take a  closer look.<br /><strong><br /></strong>A little state political history here. Barnes  did two stints in the state Legislature, from 1974 to 1990 and from  1992 to 1998. In 1998, he was elected the state's 80th governor.<strong><br /></strong><br />But  despite vastly superior funding Barnes lost a re-election bid in 2002  to an underdog, a former state senator named Sonny Perdue. Barnes had  angered supporters of the old Georgia state flag, which he changed to  minimize its Confederate emblem. And then he ran afoul of some state  residents because of what they perceived as heavy-handed tactics when  new political boundaries were drawn during redistricting.<br /><br />Some  political observers, however, believe Barnes' real roadblock in the 2002  defeat was the state's 125,000 public school teachers. As governor,  Barnes angered many of those educators with his ambitous school reforms.  Many educators felt Barnes blamed them for low test scores, poor  graduation rates and other failings. <br /><br />The former governor is now  heading into the July 20 Democratic primary trying to win back those  teacher votes. In June, Barnes took the extraordinary step of filming a  90-second video apologizing to Georgia's teachers for not listening  enough to them when he attempted to implement some of his education  reforms.<br /><br />Now, he is promising to remove some of the very same tax  exemptions for business that he supported as a state lawmaker and  governor to help teachers. <br /><br />As governor, Barnes approved tax  exemptions on the sale of solar panels, a corporate tax credit for a  Macon-based tobacco manufacturing plant and Girl Scout cookies. Jeffrey  Humphreys, a prominent economist, said most states offer tax breaks and  exemptions for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's done as a deliberate  strategy to help some industries grow. Sometimes it's done to lower the  consumer costs on some items. Humphreys said it's often done to be  competitive with other states.<br /><br />\"They don't want to be out of step  with other states competing for jobs,\" said Humphreys, director of the  University of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth.<br /><br />Humphreys  believes revenue collections are more stable with fewer exemptions.<br /><br />Sarah  Beth Gehl, deputy director of the Georgia Budget &amp; Policy  Institute, said some exemptions are worthwhile, but others are \"purely  political giveaways.\" She agrees many of them should be re-examined.<strong><br /></strong><br />Barnes  explained that some of the exemptions have hurt funding for education.  The exemptions Barnes voted for and signed as governor cost Georgia, and  saved the recipients, at least $1.2 billion a year, state fiscal notes  show. School boards across Georgia have slashed their budgets -- and  jobs, in some cases -- in recent months to balance their financial  books. One problem many of them have cited is receiving less money from  the state.<br /><br />Barnes has said he wouldn't touch some of the larger  breaks, such as the tax exemptions on the sale of many groceries and  prescription drugs. As governor he'd like the authority to suspend or  eliminate others, until there is more funding for education. A new  commission was recently created that could make changes to some of these  tax breaks and exemptions. Humphreys is on the commission.<br /><br />We  asked the Barnes camp which exemptions it would cut. It didn't offer  specifics, focusing on exemptions approved under the Perdue  administration.<br /><br />\"All the special interest income and sales tax  exemptions passed over the past several years need to be put on the  table for temporary suspension,\" Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter  said in an e-mail.<br /><br />Carpenter argued this is not a political  flip-flop. Carpenter said state government is currently in a tougher  financial pinch than when Barnes was governor. The exemptions approved  under the Barnes administration never resulted in drastic actions, such  as teacher furloughs, Carpenter said. Perdue, however, found the state's  finances were in worse shape than previously thought when he succeeded  Barnes in 2003.<br /><br />Yes, Barnes has changed his position on some  exemptions. But Barnes still believes some of the breaks -- and some  very large ones -- should stay in place. Because of that, Barnes  sidestepped a full Flip Flop on the Truth-o-Meter. He gets a Half-Flip.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-08T16:33:37.056228", "ruling_date": "2010-07-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Barnes now opposes some of the business tax breaks that he once supported", "ruling_headline_slug": "barnes-now-opposes-some-business-tax-breaks-he-onc", "ruling_link_text": "Barnes backtracks on past initiatives", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Teacher vote at center of race,\" June 20,  2010<br /><br />Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"Barnes reverses on tax  breaks,\" July 4, 2010<br /><br />Roy Barnes campaign <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVlL_ASh0s&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>, June 8, 2010<br /><br />E-mail  from Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter, July 7, 2010<br /><br />Telephone  interview with Sarah Beth Gehl, July 8, 2010<br /><br />Telephone interview  with Jeffrey Humphreys, July 8, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Roy", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 420, "last_name": "Barnes", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "roy-barnes", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/RoyBarnes.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/420/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>On tax breaks for businesses</p>", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2010-07-04", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Roy", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 420, "last_name": "Barnes", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "roy-barnes", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/RoyBarnes.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/420/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
