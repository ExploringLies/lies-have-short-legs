The horse has its front legs in the air but Peter the Great died of gangrene, not in battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second image appears to be of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/richmond/washingtonmonument.html\">Virginia Washington Monument</a>, showing George Washington on a horse with one leg aloft. But Washington didn&rsquo;t die from battle wounds&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/the-death-of-george-washington/\">he fell ill</a> after working in cold, wet weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final image appears to be a statue of <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/our-building-and-squares/trafalgar-square\">King George IV</a> on a horse with all four feet on the ground in Trafalgar Square in London. It&rsquo;s true that George didn&rsquo;t die in battle, or afterward from wounds.

Still, there are plenty of other statues that buck it.
