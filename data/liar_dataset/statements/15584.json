Stinnett said the section was likely removed for its reference to &quot;merciless Indian savages.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The removal of the post was an automated action,&quot; Stinnett wrote. &quot;If any human being working at Facebook were to review it, no doubt the post would be allowed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, Stinnett updated the article and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thelibertyvindicator/photos/a.475703379114158.111037.145425585475274/2229529937064818/?type=3&amp;theater\">posted</a> to Facebook to announce that the post had been restored. He said the Vindicator received an email from Facebook that said, &quot;It looks like we made a mistake and removed something you posted on Facebook that didn&rsquo;t go against our Community Standards. We want to apologize and let you know that we&rsquo;ve restored your content and removed any blocks on your account related to this incorrect action.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geller acknowledged in her email that Facebook apologized and restored the post, but her story did not mention the apology or the fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We restored the post and apologized to The Vindicator on July 3&nbsp;as soon as we saw our error,&quot;&nbsp;said Sarah Pollack, a spokesperson for Facebook. &quot;We process millions of reports every week, and sometimes we make mistakes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the first time Facebook&rsquo;s censors have removed posts of historical significance. In 2016, Facebook <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/09/10/493454256/with-napalm-girl-facebook-humans-not-algorithms-struggle-to-be-editor\">suspended</a> one user&rsquo;s account after he posted an image of The Terror War, a Pulitzer-prize-winning photograph that depicts a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. The photo, removed as nudity and child porn, was eventually restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Geller Report story had a point that a newspaper&rsquo;s post of the Declaration of Independence was temporarily removed from Facebook for appearing to violate &quot;hate speech&quot; standards. But the website did not mention that Facebook said it was a mistake and restored the post.
