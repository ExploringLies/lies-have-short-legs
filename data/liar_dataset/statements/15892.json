None other than Brett Kavanaugh&rsquo;s mother, Martha G Kavanaugh. You literally cannot make this up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blog <a href=\"https://www.pacificpundit.com/2018/09/16/christine-blasey-ford-revenge-parents-foreclosure/\">Pacific Pundit </a>went even further. &quot;Martha G. Kavanaugh, the mother of Brett Kavanaugh was a Maryland district judge in 1996. In an amazing coincidence, Martha Kavanaugh was the judge in a foreclosure case in which Christine Blasey-Ford&rsquo;s parents were the defendants. Now it all becomes clear,&quot; the blog wrote. &quot;Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh, not because of what he did in high school. Instead, Christine Blasey-Ford is going after Brett Kavanaugh out of spite and revenge for a case rulled (sic) on by Brett Kavanaugh mother. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

However, according to the same documents, Martha Kavanaugh dismissed the case at the plaintiff&rsquo;s request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The America First Media Group blog post includes <a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/af-mg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kavanaugh2.jpg?w=675&amp;ssl=1\">screenshots</a> of that same case information, which says the voluntary motion to dismiss the case was &quot;granted with prejudice,&quot; meaning the plaintiff cannot sue over the same issue again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to court records, CBS News found the same information when reporters went to the Montgomery County Court to look into the case. They<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenportnoy/status/1041783867290644480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1041783867290644480%7Ctwgr%5E363937393b636f6e74726f6c&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F09%2F19%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fchristine-blasey-ford-kavanaughs-fact-check.html\"> found</a> that the Blaseys settled with their mortgage lender, and the bank requested Martha Kavanaugh dismiss the case. She did. They found no evidence that the Blaseys appeared in her courtroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gateway Pundit has since updated its story to include a tweet from a CBS reporter. The Gateway Pundit article now says, &quot;The case was settled amicably and the Blaseys kept their house.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://time.com/5400239/christine-blasey-ford-investigation-letter/\">a letter to the Judiciary Committee</a>, Ford&rsquo;s lawyers said she had &quot;been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats.&quot; They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford&rsquo;s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers speculated that the reason Christine Blasey Ford went public with sexual assault allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh was because Kavanaugh&rsquo;s mother presided over a foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford&rsquo;s parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This line of thinking has been debunked by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/no-brett-kavanaughs-mother-didnt-foreclose-on-his-accusers-parents\">Washington Examiner</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/politics/christine-blasey-ford-kavanaughs-fact-check.html\">New York Times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brett-kavanaugh-foreclosure-accuser-parents/\">Snopes</a>&nbsp;and now, PolitiFact. The facts don&rsquo;t support the accusation. Kavanaugh&rsquo;s mother simply executed a settlement made by the plaintiff &mdash; a mortgage lender &mdash; and Ford&rsquo;s family.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put simply, Kavanaugh&rsquo;s mother had no effect on the outcome of the case. A dismissed foreclosure case involving Ford&rsquo;s parents is an incredibly unlikely basis for a revenge-motivated sexual assault accusation 22 years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-20T14:48:18.563021", "ruling_date": "2018-09-20T15:09:38", "ruling_headline": "Fact-checking False link between foreclosure case, Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault allegations ", "ruling_headline_slug": "kavanaughs-mother-dismissed-foreclosure-case", "ruling_link_text": "No motive", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>America First Media Group, &quot;<a href=\"https://af-mg.com/2018/09/17/breaking-news-christine-fords-parents-were-defendants-in-a-1996-foreclosure-case-guess-whos-mom-was-the-judge/\">BREAKING NEWS: Christine Ford&rsquo;s parents were defendants in a 1996 foreclosure case, guess whose mom was the judge?</a>,&quot; Sept. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gateway Pundit, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/09/bad-blood-judge-kavanaughs-mother-foreclosed-on-far-left-accusers-parents-home/\">Bad Blood: Judge Kavanaugh&rsquo;s mother presided over far left accuser&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; home foreclosure (UPDATED)</a>,&quot; Sept. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maryland Judiciary Case Search, <a href=\"http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/inquiryDetail.jis?caseId=156006V&amp;loc=68&amp;detailLoc=MCCI\">Case Number: 156006V</a>, accessed Sept. 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News White House reporter Steven Portnoy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenportnoy/status/1041783867290644480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1041783867290644480%7Ctwgr%5E363937393b636f6e74726f6c&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F09%2F19%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fchristine-blasey-ford-kavanaughs-fact-check.html\">tweet</a>, Sept. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html?utm_term=.49d43f17ce2b\">California professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault</a>,&quot; Sept. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TIME, &quot;<a href=\"http://time.com/5400239/christine-blasey-ford-investigation-letter/\">Read the letter from Christine Blasey Ford&#39;s lawyers requesting an FBI Inquiry Into Kavanaugh allegation,</a>&quot; Sept. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/politics/christine-blasey-ford-kavanaughs-fact-check.html\">Debunking 5 viral rumors about Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh&rsquo;s accuser</a>,&quot; Sept. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Yorker, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-sexual-misconduct-allegation-against-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-stirs-tension-among-democrats-in-congress\">A sexual-misconduct allegation against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stirs tension among Democrats in Congress</a>,&quot; Sept. 14, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Brett Kavanaugh&rsquo;s mother presided over foreclosure case against Christine Blasey Ford&rsquo;s parents, which fueled motivation for sexual assault accusation.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-09-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 108, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/108/", "subject": "Supreme Court", "subject_slug": "supreme-court", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Fact-checking false link between foreclosure case, Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault allegations "}
