Although Fox has reported the incident, the local media is working real hard on not covering that little fact. Imagine that!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ihavethetruth.com doesn&rsquo;t describe itself as a news source--or much otherwise. Its <a href=\"https://ihavethetruth.com/about-2/#ixzz4ggu4Pau\">&quot;About&quot; web page</a> says only: &quot;I Have The Truth is where you show up every day for your marching orders.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No evidence, newspaper says</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A day after the site said a student intervened with a gun, the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> published a <a href=\"https://www.mystatesman.com/news/local/viral-item-debunked-evidence-gun-brandishing-student-helped-subdue-attacker/z92T0lb56COS9cb6emNGeN/\">news story</a> finding no confirmation that a gun-toting student got involved. The prospect of someone pulling a gun had seemed especially possible because the Texas law allowing individuals with state-issued permits to carry a handgun on public college campuses <a href=\"https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/\">took effect</a> in August 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>American-Statesman</em>&nbsp;story, partly headlined &quot;VIRAL ITEM DEBUNKED,&quot; said chatter about a student possibly brandishing a gun to help police end the incident appeared to have originated in an anonymous Twitter feed, whose user posted a screenshot of a conversation thread in which someone &ndash; whose name was blurred out &ndash; claims to have &quot;grabbed my gun and ... chased the kid briefly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the&nbsp;story by reporter Marty Toohey, UT police termed the rumor of help from an armed student false and said they&rsquo;d found no corroborating evidence, be it video or first-hand accounts. &quot;It&rsquo;s a rumor and there&rsquo;s nothing to verify it,&quot; campus spokeswoman Cindy Posey said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the student-with-a-gun account also was <a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/report-student-with-gun-stops-mass-stabbing-at-university-of-texas/\">trumpeted on&nbsp;the InfoWars web site under the headline &quot;Report: Student with gun stops mass stabbing at University of Texas</a>.&quot; Its post pointed to a May 1, 2017, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Texasrebel562/status/859161142639431681\">tweet</a> by @TexasRebel56, who appears to have shared a screenshot of a private message of someone &ndash; the names of the people on thread are obscured &ndash; claiming: &quot;I ran inside and grabbed my gun out (sic) and came back and chased the kid briefly but I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable shooting because people were around.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also on May 1, a UT student who arrived at the scene after the attack told the <em>American-Statesman</em> that another student told him he had &quot;flashed&quot; a gun at the suspect. But police said they couldn&rsquo;t confirm that story, adding that it was unlikely based upon the incident&#39;s brief timeframe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same day, UT Student Government Vice President Binna Kim was among those who repeated the rumor, though after sending it via GroupMe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beanzkim/status/859173279810154496\">she promptly tweeted an apology that stated the rumor had not been confirmed.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Police chief a day later</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a May 2, 2017, press conference, a reporter <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByADfVML7N9mUlhjb0V4NjBuVWM/view\">asked</a> UT Police Chief David Carter: &quot;There was a rumor on social media that someone with a concealed handgun prevented further attacks. Is there any validity to that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter replied: &quot;So one of the things that bedevils police departments on occasion is the information that comes across social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, we&rsquo;ve heard that,&quot; the chief said. &quot;We have no verification of that. I will tell you, if you look at the sequence of events and the timeline, it doesn&rsquo;t appear likely.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter said that a minute and a half elapsed between the stabbings and before the student accused of the knife attacks, <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/crime--law/affidavit-man-charged-stabbings-said-didn-remember-attack/MwXtfv9YT2x0TxyaWnK3kL/\">Kendrex White</a>, was apprehended as he moved toward a campus dormitory knife-in-hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A day earlier, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/05/01/multiple-people-may-have-been-stabbed-on-university-of-texas-at-austin-campus-police-say/?utm_term=.1f0e97e03c70\">Carter specified</a>&nbsp;that that about 1:49 p.m. May 1, his department got a call about an individual who &quot;actually attacked or assaulted somebody&quot; near a gym. In less than two minutes, an officer was on the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The officer observed the individual walking away from an individual who was down on the ground,&quot; Carter said. &quot;He was armed with a large, Bowie-style hunting knife.&quot; The officer confronted the man, Carter said, drawing his weapon and ordering the man to the ground. Then the suspect was taken into custody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 4, 2017, the debunkists at <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/handgun-student-stabbing/\">Snopes.com</a> found &quot;unproven&quot; the idea that a student with a concealed handgun stopped the knife attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then an Associated Press&nbsp;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/university-texas-stabbings-put-campus-carry-law-test-47256630\">news story</a>, published May 7, 2017, said that during the UT incident, &quot;no gun-toting student or professor pulled a pistol to stop the man in his tracks. No shots were fired and no gun was even drawn until police swarmed in to subdue the suspect.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No changes, UT says</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked UT if there were developments since the knife attacks suggesting a&nbsp;student with a gun helped quell the attacker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Shilpa Bakre replied: &quot;This is an incorrect rumor.&quot; Bakre said a UTPD officer &quot;took the suspect down and arrested him &ndash; no civilians with guns were involved. Police have interviewed over 40 witnesses thus far, as well as reviewed video footage to support this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A web blog said a UT student used a concealed gun to help police stop knife attacks on the campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a&nbsp;week-plus after&nbsp;the attacks, there were no credible news reports or law-enforcement confirmations of this claim which looks to us like it was bandied by pro-gun advocates presuming or perhaps wishing it was so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>PANTS ON FIRE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
