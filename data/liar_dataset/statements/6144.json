The Legislature divided the state into 12 regions to give residents choices of potential transportation projects that may best help their region, if they choose to do so. In a 10-county region that encompasses the city of Atlanta, its largest counties and other suburbs, the tax could fund 157 transportation projects if the referendum passes. The vote is scheduled for July 31.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome referendum opponents have a list as long as Buford Highway that outlines their objections to the plan. One reason they&rsquo;ve said they don&rsquo;t want it is they&rsquo;re not in favor of an additional tax across an entire region. They don&rsquo;t trust elected officials to spend the money as planned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDooley outlined those concerns and others at a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;ve been fiscally responsible with the tax dollars they&rsquo;ve been given,&quot; Dooley said of elected officials in her opening remarks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDooley said she and others have presented some ideas to referendum supporters, but were rebuffed. She then talked about the gas tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We support increasing the gas tax, which has not been done since 1991,&quot; Dooley said at the forum, Citizens for Transportation Mobility wrote in the press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia&rsquo;s excise gas tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon, the second lowest in the country. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) It has not changed since 1971, which Dooley actually said at the forum.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCitizens for Transportation Mobility criticized Dooley&rsquo;s idea.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have been waiting on the opposition to come up with their &lsquo;Plan B&rsquo; and we now see that they want to build more toll roads, raise gas taxes and take away the power of citizens to vote on a specific project list,&quot; said Che Watkins, campaign manager for Citizens for Transportation Mobility. &quot;We are frankly shocked that a tea party leader would advocate for higher permanent taxes with less public accountability.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDooley actually said more than what was mentioned in the press release, a video of the meeting showed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;One of the funding mechanisms we would look at once the gas prices came down to a manageable level is to increase the gas tax,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCitizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman Saba Long defended the organization&rsquo;s position, noting that Dooley didn&rsquo;t say how much lower gas prices must be in order for her to support increasing the gas tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;She&rsquo;s trying to have it both ways,&quot; Long said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDooley told PolitiFact Georgia gas prices must be $2 a gallon or less before she would consider supporting an increase to excise gas taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDooley did float the idea of raising the gas tax. But she said in the same sentence that gas prices must come down first. She also stated her distrust of elected officials with tax dollars. Neither was included in the press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Citizens for Transportation Mobility statement was based on an accurate comment by Dooley, but it leaves out some important context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder our rating system, that is a classic Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-22T13:12:42.386526", "ruling_date": "2012-06-25T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Pro-transportation group says tax foe backs hike", "ruling_headline_slug": "pro-transportation-group-says-tax-foe-pro-tax", "ruling_link_text": "That's not the whole story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCivic League for Regional Atlanta forum <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj5ajsUpbfI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a>, June 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCitizens for Transportation Mobility press release, June 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Debbie Dooley, June 16 and 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPeach Pundit, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.peachpundit.com/2012/06/14/dueling-t-splost-press-releases-maven-vs-tea-party-cage-match/#more-44235\">Dueling T-SPLOST Press Releases; Untie Atlanta vs TEA Party Cage Match</a>,&quot; June 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSaporta Report, &quot;<a href=\"http://saportareport.com/blog/2012/06/civic-league-program-on-transportation-tax-touches-on-corruption-gas-tax-plan-b/\">Civic League: Program on proposed transportation sales tax touches on corruption, gas tax hike, Plan B</a>,&quot; June 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState of Georgia <a href=\"https://etax.dor.ga.gov/salestax/bulletins/Prepaid_State_Rates_Effective_July_1_2012.pdf\">order</a> signed by Gov.
