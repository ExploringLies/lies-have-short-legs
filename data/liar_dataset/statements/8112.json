The company has told investors it would owe $1.7 million in taxes and penalties if it loses the case, according to the Associated Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democrat accused Cuccinelli of ignoring the case, rather than taking the company to court -- a charge Cuccinelli vehemently denied, but McAuliffe continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Finally a judge took the case away from him because of a conflict of interest,&quot; McAuliffe said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Josh Schwerin, McAuliffe&rsquo;s campaign spokesman for proof that a judge removed Cuccinelli from the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schwerin cited a May 6, 2013 order from Mecklenburg Circuit Court Judge Leslie M. Osborn that moved the case from Cuccinelli&rsquo;s office to two attorneys at the Richmond-based Troutman Sanders law firm who are representing the state on a pro bono basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, McAuliffe has a point in that a judge did take the case away from Cuccinelli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But McAuliffe&rsquo;s campaign omits a major point -- the fact that the judge did that at the request of the attorney general&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a motion that was signed by the pro bono attorneys -- Stephen D. Rosenthal and William H. Hurd -- Virginia assistant attorney general Elizabeth B. Myers requested that outside counsel handle the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The motion granting that request makes no reference to whether the attorney general has a conflict of interest. It&rsquo;s merely a pro forma order granting the request to switch counsel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli asked to be removed from the case after Democrats accused him of a conflict of interest in representing the state in the case involving Williams -- who had given Cuccinelli $13,000 in gifts. Cuccinelli later disclosed that he received an additional $5,000 in gifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli also disclosed -- belatedly -- his sale of Star Scientific stock because he said he hadn&rsquo;t realized its value had crossed the $10,000 threshold above which the state requires &nbsp;disclosure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a prepared April 5 statement, Cuccinelli explained his decision to remove the attorney general&rsquo;s office from the case and appoint outside attorneys to handle it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To be clear, there was absolutely no conflict of interest with the attorney general&rsquo;s office,&quot; Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for the attorney general said in the statement. &quot;But in an abundance of caution, and to move past what has become an unnecessary distraction for the office and the attorney general, the case was given to outside counsel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gottstein went on to say Cuccinelli was not personally involved in the tax case and that the attorney general&rsquo;s office had filed all of its required pleadings within court deadlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But In a March 22 article, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/tax-suit-raises-conflict-questions-for-cuccinelli-89216.html\"><u>quoted </u></a>Paul Campsen, a private Norfolk attorney who specializes in tax litigation saying the attorney general&rsquo;s previous connection to the case &quot;isn&rsquo;t just the appearance of a conflict, it is a conflict of interest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe said a judge took the Star Scientific tax case away from Cuccinelli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a grain of truth in McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim, because a judge did indeed grant a motion removing the attorney general from the case. But McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement is misleading because it ignores some crucial information -- the fact that the attorney general&rsquo;s office was the one that requested to be removed from the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-02T16:07:15.978745", "ruling_date": "2013-08-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "McAuliffe says a judge removed Ken Cuccinelli from the Star Scientific tax case", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcauliffe-says-judge-removed-ken-cuccinelli-star-s", "ruling_link_text": "Because Cuccinelli asked", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Terry McAuliffe comments at Virginia Bar Association Debate, July 20, 2013.
