John McCain to die from a brain tumor originally came from a parody website looking to troll conservatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline on a <a href=\"http://dailythings.world/2017/07/20/barack-obama-tweets-sick-attack-john-mccain-says-died/\">July 20, 2017, post on DailyThings.world</a> read, &quot;Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died.&quot; Facebook users flagged the story here and on <a href=\"http://newsfeedhunter.com/barack-obama-tweets-sick-attack-on-john-mccain-says-he-should-have-died/\">NewsFeedHunter.com</a> as being potentially fabricated, in an effort to cut down on fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story included an image of a July 19 tweet from Obama that read, &quot;John McCain is NOT a war hero. If there were any God in heaven, he would have died from that brain tumor.&quot; The post said Obama quickly deleted the tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The story came on the heels of the announcement that McCain, R-Ariz., was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/health/gupta-mccain-glioblastoma/index.html\">diagnosed with a brain tumor</a> called a primary glioblastoma. The American Brain Tumor Association said that a 2009 study showed <a href=\"http://www.abta.org/brain-tumor-information/types-of-tumors/glioblastoma.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/?referrer=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/health/gupta-mccain-glioblastoma/index.html\">almost 10 percent of patients</a> may potentially live five years or longer. The 80-year-old is considering treatment options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCain returned to the U.S. Senate for votes on Republican health care reform, most recently <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2017/07/27/539907467/senate-careens-toward-high-drama-midnight-health-care-vote\">casting a deciding vote against a last-ditch &quot;skinny repeal&quot; bill</a> to end the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s be clear: This story is completely fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no such tweet for Obama to delete. It was no doubt the product of any number of websites that allow you to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/mar/14/fake-140-characters-how-not-get-tripped-hoax-twitt/\">create a fake tweet that appears to come from another account</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing Obama tweeted on July 19 were words of encouragement for McCain, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;John McCain is an American hero &amp; one of the bravest fighters I&#39;ve ever known. Cancer doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s up against.
