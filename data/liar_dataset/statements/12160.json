The &quot;chalking&quot; incident ignited a campus protest where some students expressed &quot;pain&quot; and rabid paranoia in wake of the serial pro-Trump scribblings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protesters were immediately pilloried from the right and left as a bunch of coddled whiners. One part of the news stories and viral social media posts caught PolitiFact&rsquo;s attention. Many of the reports said the offended students were provided counseling to ease their PTSD &mdash; Post Trump Scribbling Disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"politifact-photos-trump_at_emory (1).JPG\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JBTSzuZ1Pj65e72AIKolqSNvHw5ob2xjs6b1EbalTofd3ZEakfZsRGSQbN9nZe-5ZsFMwxzSMFsOAdUTI5aiLkb-xNecP4iZOY3TF3dwfbK_QN-FyzQFKt6zD99y6Oik8mK3LHw-\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:583px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:487px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say it ain&rsquo;t so. Well, PolitiFact Georgia discovered it mostly ain&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trouble began when a yet-to-be-identified person(s) wrote pro-Trump slogans in chalk on sidewalks, steps and railings on the campus. Horrified students awoke to the madness and quickly noted Trump&rsquo;s penchant for the politically controversial. Trump has advocated deporting all illegal immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, reported that about 40 students soon staged a campus protest, at one point shouting to the school&rsquo;s administration: &quot;You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!&quot; Then students moved into the administration building calling out: &quot;It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics saw the incident as political correctness run amok at an institution that is supposed to promote free speech and a diversity of ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pundits pounced. The story was carried across the globe. Left-leaning comedian Bill Maher said this: &quot;I so badly want to dropkick these kids into a place where there is actual pain and suffering.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larry Wilmore fired off a brutal Comedy Central segment, complete with a fake Emory student (Justice Davenport) who opined: &quot;I had no idea I went to school with people who had different opinions from me. It&rsquo;s terrifying.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newspapers, network television and social media joined the beat-down, many asserting that counseling was being offered to soothe the bruised psyches of the offended students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that part of the story is off base, Emory spokeswoman Elaine Justice said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Emory University did not offer counseling to students as a result of the incident and subsequent controversy,&quot; Justice said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the counseling confusion comes from a March 22 email sent to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email refers to &quot;emergency funds&quot; offered &quot;for student groups seeking to respond to the incident.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those funds were not for counseling, Justice said. Snopes.com ruled as &quot;false&quot; one report that Emory provided &quot;emergency counseling.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Likewise, the (Student Government Association) and College Council offered &lsquo;open office hours&rsquo; to their fellow students, not counseling,&quot; Justice said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Justice also added this: &quot;As is the case at every university, counseling is routinely available to all students in whatever circumstances they are experiencing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did any Emory student seek that routinely available counseling as a result of the chalkings? Justice said she did not know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various media outlets reported that counseling was specifically offered to Emory students upset over the fact that someone chalked pro-Trump messages on campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no funds were provided for any kind of emergency counseling due to the incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Counseling is routinely provided to Emory students upon request. But there was no organized effort to counsel students due to this specific incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The university cannot confirm whether any individual students sought routine counseling as a result of the chalkings. And that does create a bit of uncertainty in the dust-up over the Trump chalkings and their aftermath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-31T16:06:25.831963", "ruling_date": "2016-03-31T16:23:01", "ruling_headline": "Media off base in claims about Emory counseling after Trump incident", "ruling_headline_slug": "media-base-claims-about-emory-counseling-after-tru", "ruling_link_text": "Chalk this one up to bad information ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Politico <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/03/26/maher_mocks_emory_university_students_offended_by_pro-trump_message_i_want_to_dropkick_these_kids.html\">article</a> on Bill Maher</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larry Wilmore <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/video-clips/te5i2g/the-nightly-show-with-larry-wilmore-babies-on-campus---donald-trump-graffiti-freak-out\">segment</a> on Emory</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Caller <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/29/heroes-emory-students-respond-to-denunciations-of-trump-chalking-with-more-trump-chalking/\">article </a>on Emory protests</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside Higher Ed <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/28/new-round-chalkings-emory-and-new-debate-pro-trump-message-scripps\">article</a> on Emory protests</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/news/local/torpy-at-large-trump-backer-chalks-up-a-microaggre/nqr7g/\">Torpy </a>At Large</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails from Elaine Justice, March 30</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/emory-students-trump-graffiti/\">Snopes</a> on &quot;emergency counseling&quot; for Emory students</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emory Wheel <a href=\"http://emorywheel.com/emory-students-express-discontent-with-administrative-response-to-trump-chalkings/\">article</a> March 22</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "none", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Viral", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 3334, "last_name": "media reports", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "viral-media-reports", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouette_41.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3334/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://myajc.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Emory University students were provided counseling after someone wrote &quot;Trump 2016&quot; in chalk on campus.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Newspaper, television and social media", "statement_date": "2016-03-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Emory ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia ", "id": 3448, "last_name": "University ", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "emory-university", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": null, "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3448/", "total_count": 0, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": "Media mangles Emory counseling angle of Trump \"chalking\" story"}
