The law would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions and would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. But opponents liken the measure to union busting, saying it will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. They also argue that the law is unnecessary because Florida is a right-to-work state where no employee can be forced to join a union and pay union dues. By choosing to join the union and pay dues, members are effectively supporting the union&#39;s agenda.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"1144\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"1145\" />\r\n\tThe back-and-forth has played out several times in House and Senate committee hearings where the bill has been considered. The House version, <a goog_docs_charindex=\"1288\" href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=46083\">HB 1021</a>, is being sponsored by Rep.

Employees automatically have money taken out of their paycheck to pay for all kinds of things.

In responding to a question about the cost of eliminating the payroll deductions, Dorworth said, &quot;I tend to agree.

Governments also could ask unions to pay for the cost as part of a union&#39;s collective bargaining agreement. There are reasons to vote for this bill, and Dorworth and Thrasher have articulated them, but cost isn&#39;t one of them.
