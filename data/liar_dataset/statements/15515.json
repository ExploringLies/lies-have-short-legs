Instead, kids are placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter until they can be released to a legal guardian.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome 2,000 children have been separated from the adults they were traveling with across the U.S. border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The children were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31, 2018, as a result of border-crossing prosecutions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to what Vukmir has said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Process has to be upheld&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vukmir had this exchange with Milwaukee-based TV show host Mike Gousha during a <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/article/upfront-recap-us-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-says-grass-roots-key-to-victory/21248409\">June 8, 2018 interview</a> (broadcast June 10, 2018):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gousha: &quot;Do you have any concerns about some of the reports coming from along the border that say that people who are either seeking asylum or are trying to cross into the country illegally -- that parents and children are being separated? Do you have concerns about that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vukmir: &quot;Obviously, and I am going to have to watch that very closely.
