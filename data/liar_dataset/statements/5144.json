Didn&rsquo;t the Senate pass something allowing farmers to grow hemp for food, health care products and clothing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur hunch was right. In 2009, state lawmakers approved <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.or.us/comm/sms/sms09/sb0676bjwm06-09-2009.pdf\">Senate Bill 676</a>, which authorizes farmers to grow hemp, subject to regulation by the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Oregon became the seventh state to do so, joining Maine and Hawaii.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut we can&rsquo;t grow industrial hemp yet because the federal government has yet to authorize it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Until there is some change at the federal level, we are poised to begin the process of establishing rules for production,&quot; said Bruce Pokarney, spokesman for Oregon&rsquo;s Agriculture Department.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe federal government does not allow the growing of industrial hemp in the United States.
