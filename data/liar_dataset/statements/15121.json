Among other topics, Trump discussed some of the economic achievements on his watch:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, something that people have been waiting for, as you know. When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years, and wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they&#39;re starting to go up for people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, we rated &nbsp;a similar statement by Trump about rising wages &quot;finally&quot; coming &quot;after years of wage stagnation&quot; as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/us-finally-seeing-rising-wages-donald-trump-said/\">Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s recent statement is more problematic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at the data for what economists say is the best measurement &mdash; median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, 16 years and over. This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It might be reasonable to describe the overall wage pattern from the mid 1990s to the mid 2010s as &quot;stagnant&quot; or &quot;unimpressive,&quot; but it&rsquo;s not the case that they &quot;effectively went down&quot; over those two decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 1994, median inflation-adjusted wages stood at $314. They peaked at $345 in early 2009, right before the Great Recession fully hit wages. That&rsquo;s an increase of about 10 percent &mdash; not very strong over 15 years, but not a downward path, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after weekly wages bottomed out in mid 2014, they still stood at $330, or 5 percent higher than the decade before. Again -- wages didn&rsquo;t go down over that two-decade period.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Is it accurate that for &quot;the first time in a long time (wages are) starting to go up?&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is wrong for Trump to say wages are &quot;now, for the first time in a long time&quot; increasing under his watch. Wages had already been going up for nearly three years while Barack Obama was president, at a faster pace than the previous two decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The significant upward trend in wages began in 2014, almost three years before Trump was inaugurated (and even before he had declared his candidacy for president).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the roughly three years before Trump was sworn in, median real wages rose from $330 a week to $351, or an increase of more than 6 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Trump&rsquo;s watch, wages initially went up and then fell enough to wipe out the accumulated gains. A few quarters of data can be subject to statistical noise, so there is not much we can say for certain about how Trump&rsquo;s actions have or have not affected wages. .</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they&#39;re starting to go up for people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wage growth during the two-decade period Trump is referencing was modest, even sluggish, but wages didn&rsquo;t go down over that period, even accounting for inflation. As for wages finally going up now, they rose for almost three years before Trump took office, so it&rsquo;s not credible for him to imply that he deserves credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-08T17:12:03.332443", "ruling_date": "2018-03-09T09:00:21", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump is wrong about wage trends", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-wrong-about-wage-trends", "ruling_link_text": "Slow growth above inflation, then a 3-year spurt pre-Trump", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://plus.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5279070?4\">remarks</a> before a cabinet meeting, March 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/us-finally-seeing-rising-wages-donald-trump-said/\">Is U.S. &#39;finally seeing rising wages,&#39; as Donald Trump said?</a>&quot; Jan. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jed Kolko, chief economist for Indeed.com, March 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, March 8, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down.
