Scott Walker&rsquo;s health care policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health insurance has been a key issue throughout the campaign &mdash; Walker wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Wisconsin is suing in federal court in Texas to try to make that happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Walker offered a last-minute<a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/01/scott-walker-tony-evers-hit-road-search-votes-tight-race-wisconsin-governor/1838099002/\"> proposal on pre-existing conditions</a>, saying he would codify into state law the same protections offered by the ACA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking Nov. 1, 2018, in Eau Claire, Evers reiterated that he would protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions, then pivoted to new anti-Walker claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How many students here are still under their parents&#39; health care (insurance)? There&rsquo;s more than a handful,&quot; Evers said, then added: &quot;He wants to get rid of that, too.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does Walker really want to force students off their parents&rsquo; health insurance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evers offers no specific evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked for back up for the claim, Evers spokesman Sam Lau pointed only to Walker&rsquo;s opposition to the ACA, commonly called Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Affordable Care Act allows you to stay on your parents&rsquo; health care until you are 26, and Walker is suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,&quot; Lau said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Affordable Care Act does require that insurers offering dependent child coverage make that coverage available<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/young-adult-and-aca\"> until the child turns 26</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Wisconsin law also has a similar &ndash; though less comprehensive &ndash; requirement that would remain in place even if the ACA is repealed. The provision was put into place as part of the 2011-&rsquo;13 budget, based on wording added by the Joint Finance Committee to comply with ACA requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wisconsin language would not apply to employer-sponsored insurance that is self-funded &mdash; about half the employer plans in the state. That exemption, which is part of federal law, means half the employer plans wouldn&rsquo;t be required to cover children up to age 26, said Jon Peacock, research director for Kids Forward, a Madison-based advocacy group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Walker has already signed a provision that does what Evers says Walker opposes -- provides the ability for &quot;kids&quot; to be on the health plans of their parents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more, past statements from Walker have gone further. And Walker campaign spokesman Ben Voelkel said the governor continues to support leaving the provision as it is in the ACA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cited several articles, including an Aug. 18, 2015 <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/10-things-to-know-about-scott-walker-s-healthcare-plan.html\">one from the website Becker&rsquo;s Hospital Review</a>. That article, in the midst of Walker&rsquo;s brief presidential campaign, looked at key points from Walker&rsquo;s plan to replace the ACA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the points noted: &quot;Under his proposal, Americans would not be fined for not having health insurance and those under 26 years old can stay on their parents&#39; plans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also noted a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-live/wp/2017/02/26/transcript-the-daily-202-live-with-james-hohmann-and-gov-scott-walker/?utm_term=.9494c095a1d3\">Washington Post interview</a>, in which Walker identified coverage &quot;for young people&quot; as among the things he&rsquo;d keep from the Affordable Care Act if he were creating new policy after a repeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers says Walker &quot;wants to get rid of&quot; students&rsquo; ability to stay on their parents&rsquo; health insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Evers offers no direct evidence of that claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only evidence offered &mdash; that Walker opposes the ACA, which also includes coverage through age 26 &mdash; does not logically connect. It&rsquo;s not reasonable to extrapolate from Walker&rsquo;s opposition of the ACA that he opposes each and every individual policy position within it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the claim ignores the fact that Walker has already signed into law a requirement that health insurers in Wisconsin allow young adults to stay on their parents&rsquo; insurance until age 26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Evers&rsquo; claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This item was updated on Nov. 5, 2018 to reflect information from Joe Peacock of the Kids Forward about how the provision in state law compares to the ACA.
