Joe&nbsp;Manchin too often stands against President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Referring to Trump&rsquo;s appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, &quot;If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote&quot; in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey went on to say, &quot;Whether we&#39;re talking judicial picks, whether we&#39;re talking Trump tax cuts, whether we&#39;re talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin&rsquo;s support for Trump (or lack thereof) is likely to be a major campaign wedge for Morrisey, since Trump is more popular in West Virginia than any other state, according to <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/226454/trump-approval-highest-west-virginia-lowest-vermont.aspx\">state-by-state approval ratings</a> released by Gallup in January 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey is right that Manchin <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00303\">voted against</a> the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isn&rsquo;t really right about Manchin&rsquo;s position&nbsp;on Gorsuch.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll look at Manchin&rsquo;s actions on the Gorsuch nominations; we looked at his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/patrick-morrisey/patrick-morrisey-says-joe-manchin-wont-budge-obama/\">positions on Obamacare</a> in a separate fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: When it counted, Manchin voted with Republicans to advance Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The Gorsuch confirmation</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey&rsquo;s camp pointed to three votes on April 6, 2017, during the back-and-forth over Gorsuch when Manchin voted with most Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In two cases, Manchin voted in favor of efforts by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00108\">adjourn before voting on the Gorsuch nomination</a> or to <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00107\">postpone it</a>. (Both failed along party lines.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the third vote, Manchin voted not to invoke the &quot;nuclear option,&quot; which is a procedural move to lower the number of votes required to advance to a final vote from 60 to a simple majority. In this case, too, Manchin <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00109\">voted</a> with all Democrats and against all Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, citing only these three votes paints a misleading picture of Manchin&rsquo;s actions. In the most important votes for securing Gorsuch a floor vote, Manchin sided with Gorsuch and Republicans &mdash; and he&rsquo;d telegraphed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the final showdown began, Manchin on March 27, 2017, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/harry-reid-nuclear-option-100199\">became the first Democratic senator</a> to publicly break with others in his party and say he&rsquo;d side with Republicans by committing to vote in favor of proceeding to Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By announcing his intention to support a vote for Gorsuch a full 10 days before the final action, he sent a signal to other Democrats who still might have been deciding on what to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Manchin stuck to his word: On April 6, Manchin was one of only four Democrats to vote to <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00105\">invoke cloture</a> and proceed to a final vote on Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., successfully invoked the &quot;nuclear option,&quot; the Senate once again voted on cloture, this time needing only a simple majority. Once again, Manchin <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00110\">voted to proceed</a> to Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination on April 6, this time becoming one of only three Democrats to side with every Republican on the vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, on the actual vote on Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination on April 7, Manchin <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00111\">voted in favor</a>, once again making him one of just three Democrats to back Gorsuch in the final vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate specialist Gregory Koger of the University of Miami said Manchin has the better argument than Morrisey in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ordinarily I would place real weight on procedural votes, such as adjournment and on the nuclear option precedent,&quot; he said, &quot;but I think there were extenuating circumstances, at least on the precedent vote, and the early public support for Gorsuch more than compensates for these procedural votes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey said, &quot;If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin did side with Democrats on certain procedural votes during the showdown over Gorsuch. But he broadcast his support for a vote on Gorsuch early enough to persuade fence-sitters, and on the main votes, he broke ranks with his party, siding with Republicans to secure Gorsuch a vote and ultimately confirm him to the court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-14T17:19:31.091867", "ruling_date": "2018-05-15T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Patrick Morrisey cherry-picks Joe Manchin's votes on Trump Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch", "ruling_headline_slug": "patrick-morrisey-cherry-picks-joe-manchins-votes-t", "ruling_link_text": "Manchin's support was crucial", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Patrick Morrisey, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-773315583/patrick-morrisey-on-joe-manchins-voting-record/s-sDAk8\">interview with Breitbart radio</a>, May 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roll Call, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/joe-manchin-opposes-filibuster-neil-gorsuch\">Joe Manchin Opposes Filibuster of Neil Gorsuch</a>,&quot; March 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallup, &quot;<a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/226454/trump-approval-highest-west-virginia-lowest-vermont.aspx\">Trump&#39;s Approval Highest in West Virginia, Lowest in Vermont</a>,&quot; Jan. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gregory Koger, political scientist at the University of Miami, May 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jonathan Kott, spokesperson for Joe Manchin, May 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Nachama Soloveichik, spokesperson for Patrick Morrisey, May 14, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Patrick", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 4088, "last_name": "Morrisey", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "patrick-morrisey", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/morrisey_photo.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/morrisey_photo.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4088/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio interview", "statement_date": "2018-05-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 187, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/187/", "subject": "Congressional Rules", "subject_slug": "congressional-rules", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 108, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/108/", "subject": "Supreme Court", "subject_slug": "supreme-court", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Senator from West Virginia", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Joe", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "West Virginia", "id": 758, "last_name": "Manchin", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "joe-manchin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Manchin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/758/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.governormanchin.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "Patrick Morrisey misleads in going after Joe Manchin's votes on Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch"}
