Tammy Baldwin, who is being challenged by two Republicans in her bid for re-election, made a claim about background checks that might sound extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a WisPolitics event on Feb. 22, 2018, eight days after the shooting, the Wisconsin Democrat said:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>We know that we need change. And it&rsquo;s frustrating because there is a high level of consensus across America on the sort of common-sense safety measures that need to be brought up and passed. Among gun owners -- and I&#39;m a gun owner myself -- 97 percent support expanded, universal background checks so we don&rsquo;t have the gun-show loophole, so that we don&rsquo;t have the internet purchases that don&rsquo;t go through a thorough background check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reiterate, Baldwin&rsquo;s claim is about support among gun owners, not just the general public, for requiring background checks for all gun sales, not just those done by federally licensed dealers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prior fact checks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four months before the Florida school shooting, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/03/chris-abele/do-90-americans-support-background-checks-all-gun-/\">we rated True</a> a claim by Milwaukee County Executive <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/chris-abele/\">Chris Abele</a> that 90 percent of Americans &quot;support universal background checks&quot; for gun purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a half dozen national polls that showed support at or near 90 percent. And an October 2017 poll taken by Gallup after Abele made his claim found support at <a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx\">96 percent</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s the general public. What about gun owners?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quinnipiac poll</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Baldwin&rsquo;s claim, her campaign cited a <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2521\">national telephone poll</a> by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., of 1,249 people who identified themselves as registered voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poll, done with live interviews on landlines and cell phones, was taken over four consecutive days, starting Feb. 16, 2018 -- two days after the school shooting in Parkland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question: &quot;Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we get to the results, there is one wrinkle here: Respondents weren&rsquo;t asked if they were gun owners themselves; rather, they were asked if they, or anyone in their home, owns a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was 97 percent support among gun households (as well as 97 percent among all respondents in the poll).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The margin of error for the gun households (which made up 555 of the 1,249 total respondents) was plus or minus 5 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three polling experts -- Marquette Law School Poll director <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/faculty-and-staff-directory/detail/5754835\">Charles Franklin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholar/karlyn-bowman/\">Karlyn Bowman</a> at the American Enterprise Institute and <a href=\"https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/political-science/directory/index/uid/parry/name/Janine-Parry/\">Janine Parry</a>, director of the Arkansas Poll -- told us they were not aware of any other national polls done in recent months that published results about gun owner support of universal background checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find a poll of people who identified themselves as gun owners, by the Pew Research Center, which asked: &quot;Would you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to<br />\r\nbackground checks?&quot; The result: <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/americas-complex-relationship-with-guns/\">77 percent</a> of gun owners strongly or somewhat favored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that poll was taken in March 2017, 11 months before the Parkland shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s tempting to think that support reached 97 percent in the Quinnipiac poll simply because it was taken days after the Parkland shooting. But Quinnipiac&rsquo;s results have been consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, support was 94 percent among gun households in Quinnipiac&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/search-releases/search-results/release-detail?What=&amp;strArea=;&amp;strTime=28&amp;ReleaseID=2510#Question009\">December 2017</a> and <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/search-releases/search-results/release-detail?What=&amp;strArea=;&amp;strTime=28&amp;ReleaseID=2501#Question028\">November 2017</a> polls, the most recent ones done before the February 2018 poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin says &quot;97 percent&quot; of gun owners support universal background checks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe figure is correct for the latest national poll, completed days before her claim, that asked about requiring background checks for all gun purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only clarification is that the respondents weren&rsquo;t all necessarily gun owners, but rather lived in a household where they or someone else own a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Baldwin&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p> div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-01T15:10:36.818322", "ruling_date": "2018-03-02T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "A mostly on target claim: 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks ", "ruling_headline_slug": "mostly-target-claim-97-percent-gun-owners-support-", "ruling_link_text": "97% of 'gun households'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WisPolitics, Tammy Baldwin remarks (3:30), Feb. 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt, Feb. 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/03/chris-abele/do-90-americans-support-background-checks-all-gun-/\">&quot;Do 90% of Americans support background checks for all gun sales?&quot;
