But Europe isn&#39;t so fortunate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Look at every other country from which we came and almost every one, if not every one, are dead from a faith perspective,&quot; the former U.S. senator, R-Penn., said at a Henniker, N.H., house party on July 18, 2011. &quot;You go to Europe, church attendance rates in the single digits -- secular society. Why? Because the government co-opted faith, because faith and the government are intertwined. (People in Europe) pay taxes -- you don&rsquo;t tithe to your church -- you pay taxes to support your church, and they&rsquo;ve been co-opted to the point where the two are unrecognizable as far as of difference, and so people have lost faith.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s a lot to unpack here. But let&rsquo;s start with his claim about church attendance rates: &nbsp;Do Europeans attend church, on a percentage basis, in the single digits?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Santorum&rsquo;s campaign for its source on this, we were pointed to news articles dating back to 2005 and a European Social Survey conducted in 2008 and 2009. All detail declining church attendance, but none indicate single-digit rates continent-wide.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Santorum&rsquo;s back-up material largely reaffirms the view of the experts on European worship patterns we consulted, who say Santorum is exaggerating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Europe as a whole, compared to the United States is much less religious, but there are great differences between European countries,&quot; says Peter Berger, Director of the Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs at Boston University.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRonald Inglehart, a political scientist at the University of Michigan and chairman of the Stockholm-based World Values Survey, which collects public input in religious practices in more than 100 countries, said Santorum is correct to a point. England, France, and the Scandinavian countries, do indeed have attendance rates in the single digits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But Italy has about 39 percent church attendance; Ireland has about 65 percent; Portugal 30; Spain 20; Germany 15. So, single digits are actually fairly rare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd what about about Santorum&rsquo;s other main contention: that European countries that collect a so-called &quot;church tax&quot; or earmark public money for churches, are less religious?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s recall the candidate&rsquo;s exact words:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPeople in Europe &quot;pay taxes to support your church, and they&rsquo;ve been co-opted to the point where the two are unrecognizable in terms of difference and so people have lost faith.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs sources, the Santorum campaign cited an unusual pair: French historian Alexis deTocqueville, who died in 1859, and Santorum&rsquo;s 2012 GOP-rival Mitt Romney. Both men have argued &nbsp;-- 178 years apart -- that America is better off for not having a state religion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut neither prove Santorum&rsquo;s claim that directing tax dollars to churches drives down attendance levels in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think he&rsquo;s not terribly well-informed,&quot; said Inglehart of the World Values Survey, &quot;He is stretching.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, some churches get tax support and still have high attendance rates, according to World Values Survey:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tItaly directs tax dollars to churches and attendance levels there stand at 39 percent, roughly on par with the U.S.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGermany and Austria levy &quot;church taxes&quot; and have rates of church attendance around 15 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinland and Iceland also collect taxes for religious use, and their churchgoing rates stand at around 4 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBerger examined this question in his book <em>Religious America, Secular Europe?</em> &nbsp;He says that in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Europe saw instances when political tensions led to dissatisfaction with a state church. But Berger says Santorum misses the mark when he suggests that government-church relations are driving contemporary worship trends.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He is distorting things. To talk about Europe today as if it were Europe 200 years ago is not very accurate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our Ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Santorum is right that some European countries have church attendance rates that are below 10 percent, we found others that have rates of worship well above the single digits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum&rsquo;s other claim, that European governments collect taxes and send the money to churches, is also a mixed bag. Santorum is correct when he says some countries assess so-called church taxes. But more importantly to his main point, scholars say they don&#39;t see a connection between the taxes and church attendance. Indeed, the rate in Italy is about 39 percent. So we rate this statement Mostly False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-27T18:15:17.708516", "ruling_date": "2011-07-27T18:14:51", "ruling_headline": "Rick Santorum says church attendance in the single digits in Europe because of government support", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-santorum-says-church-attendance-single-digits", "ruling_link_text": "Not a consistent pattern", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Peter R.
