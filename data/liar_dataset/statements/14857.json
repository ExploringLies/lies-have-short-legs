Marco Rubio&rsquo;s tweet about a New Testament verse was an attack on Floridians who support President Donald Trump, according to an article on Facebook that lacked evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Marco Rubio just publicly shamed his own constituents for flocking to Trump rally,&quot; stated a Dec. 9 <a href=\"http://verifiedpolitics.com/marco-rubio-just-publicly-shamed-constituents-flocking-trump-rally/\">headline</a> on verifiedpolitics.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this article jumped to a conclusion about what prompted Rubio&rsquo;s tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump held a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/08/fact-checking-trumps-make-america-great-again-spee/\"> rally in Pensacola</a> the night of Dec. 8, when he called on Alabama residents to vote for Republican Roy Moore. A few days later, Moore lost the U.S. Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.ce10fb2e94c6\"><em>Washington Post</em> reported</a> in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Verifiedpolitics.com wrote that the crowd in Pensacola, composed largely of Floridians, cheered for Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was this display that moved the normally mild mannered Senator from Miami to lash out on Twitter and throw Republicans from his own state under the bus,&quot; the website stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article then cited<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/939484117909016576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fverifiedpolitics.com%2Fmarco-rubio-just-publicly-shamed-constituents-flocking-trump-rally%2F\"> Rubio&rsquo;s tweet</a> on the morning of Dec. 9:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity 4 them b/c they were troubled &amp; abandoned like sheep without a shepherd.Matthew 9:36.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweet drew hundreds of replies. While some on Twitter replied with a photo of Trump&rsquo;s Pensacola rally, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonCalvi/status/939580868162736134\">correspondent for the Eternal World Television Network</a> replied that the verse was part of the Roman Catholic <a href=\"http://www.ewtn.com/daily-readings/?date=2017-12-9\">daily Mass.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Once again,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio\"> @marcorubio</a> quotes the daily Gospel for Mass, and Twitter can&rsquo;t handle it,&quot; Jason Calvi tweeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his autobiography <em>An American Son</em>, Rubio wrote that he attends services at Christ Fellowship, his wife&rsquo;s evangelical church, on most Saturday nights and then mass at St. Louis Catholic Church on Sundays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sent emails to Rubio&rsquo;s spokeswoman to ask if his tweet related to Trump&rsquo;s speech or Moore and did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio had no tweets Dec. 8 or 9 that mentioned Trump or Moore. He tweeted about tax reform, Army vs. Navy football and Venezuela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Rubio had made previous statements critical of Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November, Rubio <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2017/11/20/marco-rubio-roy-moore-hasnt-done-anything-convincing-or-helpful/\">said</a> on Fox &amp; Friends that Moore&rsquo;s accusers are &quot;very credible&quot; and that the charges are &quot;very serious&quot; and could be problematic for Moore if elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the implication of the verifiedpolitics.com article is that Rubio used his tweet to shame his own Florida constituents for attending the Trump rally. Rubio&rsquo;s criticism of Moore had been directed at Moore himself -- not Floridians who support Trump. And while Rubio at times has appeared <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2017/10/13/as-trump-whips-up-controversy-over-puerto-rico-rubio-calls-for-less-noise/\">critical </a>of Trump or his administration, on other issues, such as Cuba policy, the two politicians have partnered together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rubio regularly tweets verses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For <a href=\"http://postonpolitics.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2017/05/16/marco-rubio-triggers-twitter-freakout-by-quoting-bible/\">several</a> months, Rubio has regularly tweeted lines from the Bible, drawing attention from the media, religious experts and others</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an October interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Rubio defended his practice of tweeting out verses most mornings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll continue to do it,&quot; he told the network. &quot;If they don&#39;t like it, they don&#39;t have to follow me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We interviewed two experts about the religious meaning of the verse that Rubio quoted: Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Birmingham, and Christopher R. Matthews, Research Professor of New Testament at Boston College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The surface meaning of the verse is rather clear: sheep do not organize themselves (they&#39;re not the brightest), so in the absence of a shepherd/leader there is the potential for confusion and chaos,&quot; Matthews said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The verse comes within the context of several stories about Jesus healing the sick, teaching people in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news, Moss said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In its immediate context this verse is quite clearly about the people needing spiritual leadership and practical assistance (in the form of what we would call health care),&quot; she said. &quot;Taken out of context, however, that meaning is expanded so that it becomes a broader statement about people lacking moral and spiritual guidance, and how this state of affairs is distressing to God. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2017, <a href=\"http://verifiedpolitics.com/about/\">Verified Politics</a> describes itself as a political news website that it is for readers who are tired of fake news. We emailed the website and asked if they had any evidence that Rubio tweeted a New Testament verse to shame his own constituents for flocking to a Trump rally, and we did not get a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio, a regular at Sunday mass, provided no explanation for his tweet so it&rsquo;s merely speculation to conclude that his point was commentary on Trump&rsquo;s Pensacola rally the previous night. The verse from Matthew that Rubio tweeted was part of the daily Mass for that Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-17T14:38:40.947142", "ruling_date": "2017-12-18T14:30:00", "ruling_headline": "No proof that Rubio's religious tweet was related to Trump rally", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-proof-rubios-religious-tweet-was-related-trump-", "ruling_link_text": "Rubio regularly tweets from Bible", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Verifiedpolitics.com, <a href=\"http://verifiedpolitics.com/marco-rubio-just-publicly-shamed-constituents-flocking-trump-rally/\">&quot;Marco Rubio Just Publicly Shamed His Own Constituents For Flocking To Trump Rally,&quot; </a>Dec. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Sen.
