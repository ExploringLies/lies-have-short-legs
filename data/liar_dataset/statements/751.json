The average South Korean is&nbsp;3 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.\" (That statement occurs about 1:00 into the accompanying video.)\n</p>\n<p>\n We've examined a lot of unlikely facts in this campaign, including\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/341/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  the cooking of squirrels\n </a>\n and the\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/dec/10/ham-cheese-hold-bureaucracy/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  regulation of ham and cheese sandwiches\n </a>\n , but this was a new one to us. So we did some&nbsp;checking and found that McCain is right. South Koreans are, indeed, taller than North Koreans.\n</p>\n<p>\n In his study\n <em>\n  Height and weight differences between North and South Korea,\n </em>\n Daniel Schwekendiek, an economist from the University of Tuebingen in Germany, compared 2002 data that showed preschool children in North Korea were up to 5 inches shorter and up to 14 pounds lighter than children who were brought up in South Korea.\n</p>\n<p>\n A 2006 study of 1,075 North Korean defectors&nbsp;aged 20 to 39 put the difference for adults at 4 inches for men and 2.5 inches for women. A 2004 study said the difference was 2.3 inches for young men and 1.6 inches for&nbsp;young women.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n The studies blame malnutrition in North Korea for the height difference.\n</p>\n<p>\n So McCain is on solid ground with his claim. The studies vary, but his 3-inch claim is a reasonable approximation of the various studies and his underlying point is correct. We find his claim to the True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:59.603623", "ruling_date": "2008-09-27T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Yes, South Koreans taller", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-south-koreans-taller", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, South Koreans taller", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/first-presidential-debate.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Transcript of the Presidential Debate\n </a>\n , Sept. 26, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n BioInfoBank Library,\n <a href=\"http://lib.bioinfo.pl/auid:8155268\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Latest Papers\n </a>\n , Daniel Schwekendiek\n</p>\n<p>\n DPRK Studies,\n <a href=\"http://www.dprkstudies.org/2006/11/20/height-differences-in-north-and-south-koreans/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Height Differences in North and South Koreans\n </a>\n , Nov. 20, 2006\n</p>\n<p>\n The Guardian,\n <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/dec/05/northkorea\" target=\"_blank\">\n  North Korea is failing to meet growth target\n </a>\n , Dec. 5, 2004&nbsp;\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 32, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 39, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 31, "home_state": "Arizona", "id": 8, "last_name": "McCain", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "john-mccain", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnmccain.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Arizona", "edition": "Arizona", "edition_slug": "arizona", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 56, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Arizona Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/56/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/8/", "total_count": 190, "true_count": 37, "website": "http://www.johnmccain.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\"The average South Korean is&nbsp;3 inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a debate in Oxford, Miss.", "statement_date": "2008-09-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
