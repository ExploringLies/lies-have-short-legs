Members are talking about voting on the matter before the end of the year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe sticking point is exactly what a final tax package will look like. President Barack Obama campaigned on making permanent the current rates for the middle class, but raising rates for couples who make more than $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Most Republicans (and some Democrats) would like to see all the current rates made permanent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow various compromise ideas are being floated, with ideas for extending some rates temporarily or attempting reforms of the tax code.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTea party favorite Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., told George Stephanopoulos on <i>Good Morning America</i> that she was willing to accept a compromise as long as all the current tax rates stayed the same for taxpayers of all incomes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, she said, she opposed a compromise that would be attached to extending unemployment benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStephanopoulos then asked why it was okay for the wealthy to get their tax cuts extended, but not okay to extend unemployment benefits for the jobless.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well, remember again what this is. It&#39;s a massive tax increase, and it&#39;s on the people who are the job creators,&quot; Bachmann said. &quot;And people want to think that these are millionaires, sitting in leather chairs, lighting their cigars with $100 bills. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about. These are people who, who are carpet layers who maybe employ two or three other guys, or a plumber, maybe himself and his brother, and it&#39;s $250,000 in gross sales for their business. They&#39;re the ones that are looking at massive tax increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s probably a compelling narrative for Bachmann -- big government taxes the little guys. We first fact-checked similar claims during the 2008 election, when Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, aka <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/16/barack-obama/most-small-businesses-wont-be-subject-to-obamas-ta/\">Joe the Plumbe</a>r, worried he&#39;d get a tax increase under Obama&#39;s plan if he bought a company that took in around $250,000 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt wasn&#39;t true then, and it isn&#39;t true now. Here&#39;s why: Plumbers -- or any other small business owner -- get to deduct their business expenses, so they&#39;d have to be bringing in <i>more </i>than $250,000 in gross sales. The tax laws allow small business owners to deduct all kinds of business expenses: employees&#39; pay, supplies, a car or truck, fuel costs, advertising, association dues, utilities, shop repairs, and the list goes on. (For more details, read <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/ch08.html\">chapter 8</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/index.html\">Tax Guide for Small Business</a> published by the IRS.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann said that the tax increases kick in at &quot;$250,000 in gross sales,&quot; which traditionally means total sales at invoice values, or everything the plumbers billed. And, she said the plumbers would be looking at &quot;massive tax increases,&quot; when actually the top two rates would be increasing from 33 percent to 36 percent, and from 35 percent to 39.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, of all taxpayers who declare business income, about 2 percent declare enough income to see tax increases if the rates on the top brackets expire. Most small business owners would not see a tax increase, though the most profitable small businesses would.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;re not sure why Bachmann distorted the point about gross sales. As we said, it&#39;s something that&#39;s been <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/16/barack-obama/most-small-businesses-wont-be-subject-to-obamas-ta/\">explained</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/27/stephen-hayes/so-called-wealthy-are-actually-small-business-owne/\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/04/randy-neugebauer/lawmaker-claims-democrats-want-hit-small-businesse/\">times</a>. <i>Good Morning America</i> <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2010/11/michele-bachmann-supports-tax-cut-compromise-but-not-if-tied-to-unemployment-benefits-.html\">posted a note on its website</a> after Bachmann&#39;s appearance, noting that her statement was wrong. We asked her spokesperson for a comment but didn&#39;t hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe proposed increases have been discussed many times and for several years. Her misstatement of the facts on <i>Good Morning America</i> seems designed to scare small business owners into thinking they&#39;re in line for a tax increase, even if their income is modest. For distorting the tax proposals to a ridiculous extent, we rate her statement Pants on Fire.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-17T17:36:29.706052", "ruling_date": "2010-11-17T18:18:02", "ruling_headline": "Michele Bachmann says $250,000 in gross sales means a tax increase.", "ruling_headline_slug": "michele-bachmann-250000-gross-sales-tax-increase", "ruling_link_text": "It's after writing off all your business expenses.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tABC News, <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2010/11/michele-bachmann-supports-tax-cut-compromise-but-not-if-tied-to-unemployment-benefits-.html\" id=\"tbpt\" title=\"Bachmann Supports Tax Cut Compromise, But Not if Tied to Unemployment Benefits\">Bachmann Supports Tax Cut Compromise, But Not if Tied to Unemployment Benefits</a>, Nov. 16, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInternal Revenue Service, <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/index.html\" id=\"cs8l\" title=\"Tax Guide for Small Business\">Tax Guide for Small Business</a>, accessed Nov. 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartment of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/greenbk10.pdf\">General Explanations of the Administration&#39;s Fiscal Year 2011 Revenue Proposals</a>, February 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Tax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/Content/PDF/T08-0164.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Distribution of Tax Units with Business Income by Statutory Marginal Tax Rate </a> , July 14, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDefinition of &quot;gross sales,&quot; Dictonary of Business Terms, 3rd edition</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Congresswoman", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "Michele", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Minnesota", "id": 149, "last_name": "Bachmann", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "michele-bachmann", "pants_count": 16, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bachmann_mug_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/149/", "total_count": 61, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://bachmann.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSmall businesses that have &quot;$250,000 in gross sales for the business.
