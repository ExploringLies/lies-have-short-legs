But the agency announced in September that premiums for individual health insurance plans sold in Florida in 2017 would go up <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/PressReleases/viewmediarelease.aspx?id=2173\">an average of 19.1 percent</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is for any individual plan that meets the ACA&rsquo;s minimum coverage requirements, whether it&rsquo;s sold on the federal exchange&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/\">HealthCare.gov</a> or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The premium changes depend on the company: For <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/Indiviual_PPACA_Market_Monthly_Premiums_for2017.pdf\">plans sold on the exchange</a>, Health First&rsquo;s increase is the lowest at 11.7 percent. Humana&rsquo;s premiums are going up at the highest rate, 36.8 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes for compliant plans sold off the exchange range from a high of 27.3 percent for AvMed, to a decrease of 1.5 percent for premiums with Cigna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide average for premium increases is <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/212721/2017MarketplaceLandscapeBrief25.pdf\">about 25 percent</a>, according to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing Trump didn&rsquo;t mention is that customers who buy plans off the exchange won&rsquo;t necessarily be paying the full price of those increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 1.53 million Floridians bought their coverage off the federal exchange in 2016. Out of those, 1.42 million -- <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2016-Fact-sheets-items/2016-06-30.html\">93 percent</a> -- were subsidized in part by the federal government to make the plans more affordable. The average premium tax credit in Florida was $305.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 1 percent of customers who buy a plan off the exchange earn too much income and do not qualify for any subsidies. They will have to <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article111153157.html\">pay the full increase</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, people have the option to choose a different, cheaper plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 2017, Health and Human Services has estimated that <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/206741/APTCMarketplace.pdf\">86 percent of Floridians</a> who buy a plan off HealthCare.gov will be able to find a plan for $100 a month or less. Amid double-digit increases last year, average premiums after subsidies went from $82 to $84, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/florida-insurers-seek-rate-increases-for-obamacare-plans/2279141\">the agency said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, Trump is talking only about people who buy insurance on the exchanges. People who get insurance through work wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily see the same increase. Small group plans, for example, will see an <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/SGPPACAMktMonthlyPremforPY2017.pdf\">average premium increase of 9.5 percent</a>, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Jacksonville, Trump also said that &quot;over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year.&quot; For 2017, every Florida county still has at least one Obamacare option on the exchange.&nbsp;Last year, Florida Blue and UnitedHealthcare were the only two insurance companies to offer policies <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/sitedocuments/IndividualMarketPlanDistributionbyCounty.pdf\">in all 67 counties</a>. UnitedHealthcare announced earlier this year it would <a href=\"http://khn.org/news/unitedhealthcare-to-exit-all-but-handful-of-obamacare-markets-in-2017/\">leave the exchange in Florida</a> and dozens of other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;It&#39;s just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state announced in September that ACA-compliant plans would see an average premium hike of 19.1 percent. That&rsquo;s lower than the national average of 25 percent, but is still a sizable increase. Most people who buy those policies qualify for federal subsidies, however, so they likely won&rsquo;t see an increase as high as Trump is implying. And the vast majority of Floridians get their insurance through their job, where increases aren&rsquo;t going to be as high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are important points he didn&rsquo;t mention, so we rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc6699ef-5777-4860-a17e-dcf06d0032a5\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc6699ef-5777-4860-a17e-dcf06d0032a5</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-07T14:57:44.395249", "ruling_date": "2016-11-07T15:15:06", "ruling_headline": "Trump misses details when saying Florida insurance premiums going up by double digits", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-misses-details-when-saying-florida-insurance", "ruling_link_text": "He doesn't mention subsidies or plans not on the exchange", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lCsCgoQmVVo\">Comments during Jacksonville campaign rally</a>, Nov. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Health News, &quot;<a href=\"http://khn.org/news/unitedhealthcare-to-exit-all-but-handful-of-obamacare-markets-in-2017/\">UnitedHealthcare To Exit All But &lsquo;Handful&rsquo; Of Obamacare Markets In 2017</a>,&quot; &nbsp;April 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/florida-insurers-seek-rate-increases-for-obamacare-plans/2279141\">Florida insurers seek rate increases for Obamacare plans</a>,&quot; May 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fort Myers News-Press</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.news-press.com/story/news/2016/05/27/unitedhealthcare-leaving-florida-obamacare-exchange/85039848/\">UnitedHealthcare leaving Florida Obamacare exchange</a>,&quot; May 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2016-Fact-sheets-items/2016-06-30.html\">March 31, 2016 Effectuated Enrollment Snapshot</a>,&quot; June 30, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, &quot;<a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/206741/APTCMarketplace.pdf\">The Effect of Shopping and Premium Tax Credits on the Affordability of Marketplace Coverage</a>,&quot; Aug. 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/preliminary-data-on-insurer-exits-and-entrants-in-2017-affordable-care-act-marketplaces/\">Preliminary Data on Insurer Exits and Entrants in 2017 Affordable Care Act Marketplaces</a>,&quot; Aug. 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>South Florida Sun-Sentinel</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/consumer/fl-tri-county-four-health-insurers-20160830-story.html\">Report: S.
