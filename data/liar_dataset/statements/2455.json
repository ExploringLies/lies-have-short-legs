And what better way to illustrate this profligate spending than ... ant research?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYep. Ant research. And what&rsquo;s worse, it&rsquo;s not research on your run-of-the-mill picnic-destroying ant. It&rsquo;s <em>exotic ant </em>research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican Senate hopeful Jim Huffman took a page out of Arizona Sen. John McCain&rsquo;s book, dinging Democratic incumbent <a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/Congress/Ron-Wydenr/\">Sen. Ron Wyden </a>in a recent television ad for voting to fund a study of exotic ants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter an ominous intro about Oregon&rsquo;s unemployment rate and the growing national debt, the ad takes its entomological turn: &quot;Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants,&quot; a man says to his wife, while shaking his head. &quot;And you thought he was out of touch.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo does Wyden have a thing for ants or is Huffman making a mountain out of an anthill?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, before we get into all that, let&rsquo;s take a look at how, exactly, ants found their way into our political picnic in the first place. Back in August 2010, Sens. McCain and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., released a list their top &quot;<a href=\"http://coburn.senate.gov/public//index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=e1e0624e-d02a-42d4-9dbb-f5b9f21b3572\">100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Page 6, the Republican senators take aim at a favorite target, San Francisco, and a $1.9 million ant research project based out of the California Academy of Sciences. In short order, this bit of stimulus spending then found its way into the <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/04/MN2P1EOPGH.DTL\">California Senate race </a>and into the political discourse <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/aug/24/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-stimulus-money-will-fund-ipods-ut/\">down in Texas</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how does it relate to Oregon&rsquo;s Senate race?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWyden did, indeed, vote in favor of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, along with 60 other senators (including three Republicans and two Independents).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that vote, it turns out, didn&rsquo;t release any money to ant research -- not directly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal stimulus gave &nbsp;$3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009, according to the foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/index.jsp\">Website</a>. The foundation is distributing the money using the same peer-review process with which it normally decides on which research to fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs it turns out, one scientist&rsquo;s study on <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0842395\">ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa </a>made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project&rsquo;s leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think it&rsquo;s legitimate,&quot; he said. &quot;There&rsquo;s no reason why people shouldn&rsquo;t challenge this and question what we&rsquo;re doing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnts, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. &quot;You can&rsquo;t monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them,&quot; he said. &quot;Without them, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a functioning ecosystem.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher&rsquo;s last count.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt Politifact Oregon, we think it would be fair to say that Wyden&rsquo;s vote did eventually lead to the funding of a study of exotic ants. But it happened in such a roundabout way that Huffman&rsquo;s claim that &quot;Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants&quot; is disingenuous. Wyden voted for a <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/C?c111:./temp/%7Ec111fYoOjt\">bill </a>that, despite being thousands and thousands of words long never mentions the word &quot;ants.&quot; Instead it directed more money to the National Science Foundation, which then distributed the funds as it saw fit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon rates the claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/09/politifact_oregon_huffman_says.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-23T16:42:44.342342", "ruling_date": "2010-09-24T11:40:36", "ruling_headline": "Jim Huffman attacks Ron Wyden for spending $2 million on the study of exotic ants", "ruling_headline_slug": "jim-huffman-attacks-ron-wyden-spending-2-million-s", "ruling_link_text": "Do we need an ants on fire rating?", "ruling_state": "Oregon", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJim Huffman, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/15038930\">campaign advertisement</a>, Sept. 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSens.
