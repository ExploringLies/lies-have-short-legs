So we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t03.htm\">most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, which, among other things, tracks the median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bureau&rsquo;s data for the third quarter of 2015 shows that the median weekly earnings for African-American workers was $624. If you divide that by the standard 40 hours in a workweek, it works out to $15.60 per hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means that half of African-American workers earned less than $15.60. So Sanders was close on this but exaggerated slightly. His claim is off by a little more than 4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Sanders&rsquo; campaign for their source, they pointed us to a <a href=\"http://nelp.org/content/uploads/Growing-Movement-for-15-Dollars.pdf\">report</a> issued earlier this month from the National Employment Law Project that found that 54.1 percent of African-American workers earned less than $15.00 an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group calculated that figure using data from 2012 through 2014. That&rsquo;s a reasonable measurement, but while our figure covers a briefer period of time, it&rsquo;s also more current, reflecting the continued economic growth since the end of 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said that &quot;over half of the black workers in this country earn less&quot; than $15 an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the time frame used, the data shows that roughly half of black workers earn less than $15. The most recent data shows that half earn less than $15.60, which is a little higher than what Sanders said, but his number is not far off. We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-10T13:54:41.687967", "ruling_date": "2015-11-12T10:58:28", "ruling_headline": "Bernie Sanders says over half of black workers earn less than $15 an hour", "ruling_headline_slug": "bernie-sanders-says-over-half-black-workers-earn-l", "ruling_link_text": "He's off by 60 cents an hour", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bernie Sanders, comments at Democratic candidates&rsquo; forum in Rock Hill, S.C., Nov. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/wkyeng.t03.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Table 3.
