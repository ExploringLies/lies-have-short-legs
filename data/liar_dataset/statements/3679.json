John Kasich marked his 100th day in office with a news conference highlighting a long list of accomplishments. Among them were introduction of the &quot;Jobs Budget,&quot; as he called it, and passage of Senate Bill 5.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSB 5, described as &quot;collective bargaining reform,&quot; would limit collective bargaining for public employees across the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich was asked during the meeting with reporters if the economic squeeze on workers and schools and local governments made it important symbolically for state lawmakers to take a pay cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think they should be treated like all other state employees, and state employees are actually going to get a pay raise,&quot; the governor answered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA raise? In these times? While closing an $8 billion state budget deficit?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio was surprised. We asked the governor&#39;s office to explain, and looked for some background information on our own.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMembers of the General Assembly, we found, receive a base salary of $60,584 -- seventh-highest among state legislatures -- and stipends for leadership positions can raise it toward $90,000. Perks for Ohio lawmakers include public pension benefits and travel reimbursements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse Bill 41, introduced in January by Norwalk Republican Terry Boose, would cut salaries in the General Assembly and for elected executive officeholders by 5 percent. The bill has not yet had a hearing. Even if enacted, it would not affect legislator salaries during their current term of office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislators did not take the cut in pay that state employees have had for the past two years in the form of 10 mandatory furlough days, or unpaid days off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&#39;s press secretary, Rob Nichols, told us that those days were what Kasich was referring to.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He was talking about the end of furlough days imposed under the previous administration,&quot; Nichols said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich will allow the furloughs to end in July, so &quot;state workers will, in fact, get a 3.2 percent pay increase. It&#39;s not technically a raise, but state workers are going to be getting more money. They will be getting their full salary,&quot; Nichols said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, as the song says, they&#39;re going to get right back to where they started from.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd where are we?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite Nichols explanations, there is no pay raise. State workers will be getting more money in their paychecks, as Nichols noted. But that&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;ll be getting paid more for their time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose increases are a result of them working more days at the same rate of pay. When the furloughs end, state workers will no longer be forced to take unpaid days off from work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich&rsquo;s claim as False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-02T18:30:54.701482", "ruling_date": "2011-05-03T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
