Albio Sires recently called on his colleagues to stop a scheduled increase in interest rates for federally subsidized student loans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat increase would be &quot;extremely burdensome&quot; for students and families at a time when the cost of a college education has grown by nearly one-third in the last 10 years, Sires (D-13th Dist.) said June 20 in a speech on the House floor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent,&quot; Sires said. &quot;Middle class families are struggling to send their sons and daughters to school. For many Americans, a college education is essential to future success.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut PolitiFact New Jersey found that the increase in tuition and fees has been even higher than Sires claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead of 28 percent, those costs have jumped by about 72 percent at public four-year colleges and universities over the last decade, according to inflation-adjusted figures released by the College Board, the New York-based organization behind the SAT exam and many other higher education programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSires spokeswoman Erica Daughtrey told us the congressman meant to cite the increase over the past five years at public four-year institutions. During that timeframe, tuition and fees grew by roughly 28 percent at those colleges and universities, according to the College Board.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s break down the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs compiled in the College Board&rsquo;s &quot;Trends in College Pricing&quot; report, the estimates for tuition and fees are based on an annual survey of nearly 4,000 postsecondary institutions across the country. The figures represent average prices for one year of full-time enrollment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the following cost estimates, charges reported by institutions with larger full-time enrollments are weighted more heavily than those with smaller enrollments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the report, after adjusting for inflation, the average tuition and fees for public four-year institutions in the 2011-12 school year was $8,244. That figure marks a roughly 72 percent increase over the $4,793 charged in the 2001-02 school year, the report states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe average tuition and fees at public two-year institutions grew by about 45 percent during the last decade, after adjusting for inflation, from $2,047 in the 2001-02 school year to $2,963 in the 2011-12 school year, the report states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe increase in tuition and fees during the last decade has not been as steep at private nonprofit, four-year institutions, according to inflation-adjusted figures in the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the 2011-12 school year, the average cost at those schools was $28,500, representing a nearly 29 percent increase over the $22,117 in tuition and fees for the 2001-02 school year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe College Board also notes that while tuition and fees have increased during the last decade, average family incomes at all income levels have dropped.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In addition, the assets many families have saved to pay for college have diminished in value,&quot; the college board said in the report. &quot;In other words, rising tuition levels cause more problems because of the economic environment in which they are occurring.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile discussing a pending increase in interest rates for student loans, Sires said in a speech on the House floor: &quot;Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut according to the College Board, average tuition and fees at public four-year institutions increased by about 72 percent over the last decade. A spokeswoman for the congressman said Sires meant to cite the cost increase at those institutions over the past five years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Sires&rsquo; figure for the 10-year period is largely off, but his overall point about the rising cost of a college education is solid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/politifact_nj_rep_albio_sires.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-28T11:29:16.367731", "ruling_date": "2012-07-02T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Congressman Albio Sires claims college tuition has increased by 28 percent in the last decade", "ruling_headline_slug": "congressman-albio-sires-claims-college-tuition-has", "ruling_link_text": "Costs are even higher", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tOffice of Congressman Albio Sires, <a href=\"http://sires.house.gov/stop-student-loan-interest-rates-increasing\">Stop Student Loan Interest Rates from Increasing</a>, June 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/mar/07/ron-wyden/ron-wyden-puts-number-soaring-cost-college-439-per/\">Ron Wyden puts a number to the soaring cost of college - 439 percent</a>, March 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCollege Board Advocacy &amp; Policy Center, <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college_pricing\">Trends in College Pricing 2011</a>, accessed June 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Center for Education Statistics, <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/index.asp\">Digest of Education Statistics: 2011</a>, May 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/business/student-loans-weighing-down-a-generation-with-heavy-debt.html?pagewanted=all\">A Generation Hobbled by the Soaring Cost of College</a>, May 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCollege Board Advocacy &amp; Policy Center, <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college_pricing/report_findings/published_prices\">Trends in College Pricing 2011: Published Prices</a>, accessed June 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and e-mail interviews with Erica Daughtrey, spokeswoman for Congressman Albio Sires, June 25-27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Huffington Post, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/25/higher-ed-tuition-hikes-2012_n_1446559.html\">Tuition Hikes In Higher Education Around The Country At Public Colleges In 2012</a>, June 25, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhite House, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/dont-double-my-rates\">Keeping Student Interest Rates Low</a>, accessed June 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Education, <a href=\"http://studentaid.ed.gov/PORTALSWebApp/students/english/interestRateChange.jsp\">Interest Rate Change for New Direct Subsidized Loans</a>, accessed June 28, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Congressman", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Albio", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1908, "last_name": "Sires", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "albio-sires", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/sires.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Jersey", "edition": "New Jersey", "edition_slug": "new-jersey", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 13, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Jersey Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/13/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1908/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://sires.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech on the House floor", "statement_date": "2012-06-20", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
