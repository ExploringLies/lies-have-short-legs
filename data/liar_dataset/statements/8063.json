Kelly, Trey Songz, Mary J. Blige, Kanye West, Ciara, Kelly Rowland and other groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Timberlake is singled out for nixing the kickoff of his tour in Miami because he refused &quot;TO ENTERTAIN A STATE WHO&rsquo;S GOVERNMENT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SHOOT-N-KILL UN-ARMED TEENAGERS!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PSA first caught PolitiFact Florida&rsquo;s eye when it was shared in Instagram. Then the list got more attention when versions of it trickled into mainstream coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&nbsp;are skeptical of chain emails and the like that are typed in ALL CAPS, contain misspellings and do not disclose their sources. The meme we&rsquo;ve seen (which touts the misspelled names of RIHANA and ALISHIA KEYS as signing on) is a triple whammy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to investigate whether dozens of high-profile acts are really joining Wonder and boycotting Florida. Our synopsis: Just because it&rsquo;s in the news does not make it true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adding names to Stevie Wonder&#39;s boycott </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk of Florida boycotts started July 14, the day after Zimmerman&rsquo;s &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict in the death of Trayvon Martin. <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stevie-wonder-boycotting-florida-zimmerman-585760\">Wonder announced</a>&nbsp;then in Quebec City that he will never again perform in Florida until the 2005 &quot;stand your ground&quot; law is abolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He took it a step further: &quot;As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; (More than 20 other states have similar &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several musical <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/statuses/356245212378566656\">artists</a>&nbsp;and celebrities reacted to the verdict <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickyrozay/statuses/356234768020549632\">with</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/bvjnd9hM1D/\">anger</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/official_flo/status/356249492913266690\">and</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrChuckD/status/356282262570008577\">disbelief</a>. Many gave musical tributes to Martin, including <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/14/beyonce-trayvon-moment-of-silence-martin_n_3593461.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment\">Beyonc&eacute;</a>, <a href=\"http://hiphopwired.com/2013/07/14/young-jeezy-its-a-cold-world-trayvon-martin-tribute-listen/\">Young Jeezy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vibe.com/article/justin-timberlake-jay-z-dedicate-young-forever-trayvon-martin\">Jay Z and Justin Timberlake</a>, <a href=\"http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2013/7/16/patti-labelle-indiaarie-angie-stone-react-to-verdict-in-tray.html#ixzz2ZnCzdsz3\">Patti LaBelle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/springsteen/index.ssf/2013/07/bruce_springsteen_3.html\">Bruce Springsteen</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B3Uo1YKA3Q\">Wyclef Jean</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of the artists on the Instagram list -- even those who have spoken out against the verdict -- publicly announced they are joining Wonder&rsquo;s boycott. We checked social media accounts, websites and news reports and found no declarations of support for the boycott from the people on the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, it wasn&rsquo;t long before the story crossed over into news coverage. American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan cited &quot;sources close to Stevie Wonder camp&quot; for her <a href=\"http://aprildryan.com/2013/07/22/celebrities-take-action-against-stand-your-ground-law-in-florida/\">July 22 report</a>&nbsp;that claimed a similar slate of artists are joining him in support of changing &quot;stand your ground.&quot; Some have already called off concerts, she wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her AURN report was picked up by congressional newspaper <em><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/312559-report-kanye-west-rolling-stones-join-stevie-wonders-florida-boycott?utm_campaign=briefingroom&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitterfeed\">The Hill</a></em>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/jay-z-kanye-florida-boycott-zimmerman_n_3636567.html?utm_hp_ref=tw\">Huffington Post</a>&nbsp;on July 22, read and shared by thousands. The next day, even more newspapers picked it up but tried to add a little more caution (including the <em><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/jay-z-kanue-rihana-timberlake-stones-may-join-syg-fla-boycott/2132729\">Tampa Bay Times</a></em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan&rsquo;s list contained two groups that were not on the Instagram roundup: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eddie_Levert/status/357199035762868225\">Eddie Levert</a>, lead singer of the R&amp;B group The O&rsquo;Jays, and gospel duo <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151701032075053&amp;set=a.281810465052.145563.23042970052&amp;type=1&amp;theater\">Mary Mary</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We love our fans but we MUST do something!!&quot; Mary Mary wrote on Facebook. &quot;We understand a No from us isn&rsquo;t as big as a No from Stevie Wonder but if all our voices join together we can REALLY change things!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the only artists from Ryan&rsquo;s list of 23 artists who have announced they are joining Wonder&rsquo;s effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan has since updated her post with a disclaimer: <em>I obtained from multiple sources early Monday a list of artists and entertainers who my sources told me had committed to a boycott of Florida following the George Zimmerman acquittal. Since publishing that list I have heard from several representatives of the artists named who say, on behalf of their clients, they are uncomfortable being identified on that list and are seeking additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Huffington Post, hearing from artists&#39; reps that the list was not true (but not willing to go on the record), later <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/23/florida-boycott-list-discredited_n_3641100.html?1374611774\">wrote a story</a> discrediting its original post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The shows still go on</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did our own reporting. Most&nbsp;of the artists do not have upcoming tour dates in Florida. <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/things-to-do/music/rihanna-brings-the-sin-and-a-touch-of-class-in-her-tampa-bay-times-forum/2116402\">Rihanna</a>, for example, was just in Tampa in April. Madonna is not on tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This leg of Rod Stewart&#39;s tour hasn&#39;t ever included Florida dates so that isn&#39;t accurate,&quot; said Hannah Kampf, a spokeswoman for Stewart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madonna did not join the boycott, spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg told us. Neither did Alicia Keys, whose spokeswoman said in a statement, &quot;We question the validity of this list since Alicia&#39;s name along with many others has appeared erroneously.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Rolling Stones told <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/07/rolling-stones-boycott-florida-stand-your-ground\">Mother Jones</a>&nbsp;no one in the band had &quot;heard&nbsp;anything about this.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Timberlake and Jay Z do have their shared &quot;Legends of the Summer&quot; <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0D004A5495E75BA3?artistid=1837448&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=1\">concert</a>&nbsp;on Aug. 16 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Timberlake has another concert planned for December in <a href=\"http://www.amwaycenter.com/events/detail/justin-timberlake\">Orlando.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the show is off, no one told the ticket vendors, updated either artist&rsquo;s website or informed the venues. Sun Life Stadium <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SunLifeStadium/status/359723894766186496\">tweeted us</a>&nbsp;that the concert &quot;is on as scheduled.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funk maestro George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, also named among artists boycotting Florida, is scheduled to <a href=\"http://myonlineboxoffice.com/buyticket.cfm?CDECJDE=1B0533AB-FEE6-65B5-A11B7524770698A7&amp;mct=C53EA384-9851-D7A8-6D5FE79B24CFC11F\">play in Tallahassee</a>&nbsp;on July 28. We found nothing to contradict that. And funk stars Maze and Frankie Beverly are still slated to perform at the <a href=\"http://www.themahaffey.com/show/Maze-Featuring-Frankie-Beverly/230\">Mahaffey Theater</a>&nbsp;in St. Petersburg on Sept. 15, a spokeswoman confirmed to tbt*, a daily tabloid published by the <em>Tampa Bay Times.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet is rife with claims of Stevie Wonder&rsquo;s beefed-up Florida boycott. It&rsquo;s short on proof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the stars identified in social media lists may have spoken out against the verdict or in support of Trayvon, but we haven&rsquo;t seen them go the extra mile and call off shows until the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law is abolished. With the exception of two smaller acts that aren&rsquo;t included in some iterations of the meme, we could not find evidence to back up the notion that scores of acts are joining up with Wonder&#39;s boycott.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We updated this check after publishing with comments from representatives for Madonna and Alicia Keys.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-23T17:03:47.459968", "ruling_date": "2013-07-23T17:44:58", "ruling_headline": "Are Jay Z, Justin Timberlake and Rihanna joining Stevie Wonder's Florida boycott?", "ruling_headline_slug": "are-jay-z-justin-timberlake-and-rihanna-joining-st", "ruling_link_text": "Says who?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Snopes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/crime/floridaboycott.asp\">Music artists boycotting Florida?</a>&quot; July 21, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/video/stevie-wonder-boycotts-florida-094306166.html\">Stevie Wonder boycotts Florida</a>,&quot; July 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instagram, <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/cDMdMCSRj9/\">post</a>&nbsp;from Keshia Knight Pulliam, July 21, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E!
