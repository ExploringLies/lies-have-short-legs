We <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/29/jim-doyle/gov-jim-doyle-says-wisconsins-projected-budget-sho/\">rated that statement False</a>, given that Doyle&rsquo;s top administrator almost immediately portrayed the figure as $2.2 billion and experts outside of government put it at about $3 billion.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIn February 2011, about six weeks after Walker took office, state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/25/mark-pocan/wisconsin-state-rep-mark-pocan-says-gov-scott-walk/\">received a False</a> for his claim about the shortfall. Pocan said Walker manufactured a fiscal crisis and that his $3.6 billion <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/releases/February11/0207/0207doamemo.pdf\">estimate</a> was a &quot;bogus figure.&quot; At that time, we found Doyle had left a deficit of more than $3 billion and that Walker followed the past Madison practices in making his estimate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked Moore what proof she had that Walker had invented a $3.6 billion deficit. We&rsquo;ll address point by point the response we received from Moore&rsquo;s spokesman, David Frey:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Point 1:</strong> Moore thinks Walker &quot;made the state&rsquo;s fiscal situation worse&quot; and the fiscal bureau &quot;spells out the costs of his tax cuts.&quot; &nbsp;Frey noted the bureau said Walker&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/2011-13%20Budget/Governor/2011_04_15_State%20Tax%20&amp;%20Fee%20Modifications.pdf\">2011-2013 </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/2011-13%20Budget/Governor/2011_04_15_State%20Tax%20&amp;%20Fee%20Modifications.pdf\">budget</a> includes $83 million in tax cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that figure doesn&rsquo;t address the size of the budget deficit, which existed before Walker proposed his budget in March 2011. And it ignores the fact that the budget also includes $49 million in tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrey also noted <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/Misc/2011_01_31Vos&amp;Darling.pdf\">$117 million </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/Misc/2011_01_31Vos&amp;Darling.pdf\">less</a> the state will take in because of other Walker tax changes, but that figure also does not go to the size of the deficit, either. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Point 2:</strong> Moore thinks that when compared to other states, Wisconsin&rsquo;s budget situation &quot;is much more manageable.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s largely opinion and it doesn&rsquo;t specify the size of Wisconsin&rsquo;s deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Point 3: </strong>Moore thinks Walker &quot;is making all the wrong choices on this matter.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother opinion that doesn&rsquo;t get to the deficit question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Point 4:</strong> Walker&rsquo;s changes to state laws to reduce the collective bargaining powers of public employees &quot;were more about ideology than about budget issues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, that&rsquo;s an opinion -- one widely shared by Walker critics. But, like the others, that&rsquo;s not on point in terms of the size of the budget deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(On May 11, 2011, a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/121649534.html\">new </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/121649534.html\">projection</a> showed the state would take in about $200 million a year more than previously estimated over three years. It is unclear how Walker and the Legislature will adjust the budget proposal. But this, too, does not go to Moore&rsquo;s claim, which was made before the new projection was released.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn sum, Moore doesn&rsquo;t provide any evidence to back her claim -- which means we find ourselves at a familiar destination.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoore said Walker &quot;literally invented&quot; a $3.6 billion state budget deficit. We&rsquo;ve previously established that the figure is a reasonable estimate. Moore offers no new evidence to the contrary.
