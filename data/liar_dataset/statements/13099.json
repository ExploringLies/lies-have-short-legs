(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wildly inflated?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We dug a bit deeper to examine whether Steyer not only wrongly attributed the entire cost of the death penalty system to 13 cases, but also used a &quot;wildly inflated&quot; cost estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitchell, who is an advocate for abolishing capital punishment, said she&rsquo;s worked with the Yes on 62 campaign to discuss death penalty cost estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said her estimates are derived from the cost of pre-trial investigations, trials, appeals and incarceration. Her report cites figures from the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, among other sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank Zimring, a law professor and death penalty expert at UC Berkeley, said he&rsquo;s relied on the report in the past and finds the cost estimate credible, &quot;give or take a hundred million or so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cost comparison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitchell&rsquo;s said her current $5 billion cost estimate represents the amount taxpayers spent &quot;above what it would have cost us&quot; without the death penalty. Her report could not reach a conclusion, she said, on how much a life in prison system would have cost taxpayers over the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On average, it cost <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/PolicyAreas/CJ/6_cj_inmatecost\">$47,000 per year</a> to incarcerate a prison inmate in California during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, according to the Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost to house a death row inmate, however, is $90,000 more per year than for an inmate in the general prison population, said Mitchell. She attributed the higher cost to lengthy and complex death row court cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Death penalty court cases cost more than others, in part, because more attorneys are legally required to participate and more investigation is required. Costs also mount because death penalty appeals must be heard by the California Supreme Court, which has only seven justices. That creates a bottleneck, Mitchell said, where each case can stretch a decade or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without the death penalty, Zimring said the cost of trials and appeals would be &quot;vastly less.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Steyer said recently: &quot;Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that cost has been spread over hundreds of cases since 1978, not just the 13 that led to executions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California currently has more than 700 inmates on death row. Prosecuting and housing each costs the state significantly year after year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steyer&rsquo;s claim might have been correct if he had said taxpayers have spent $5 billion on a system that&rsquo;s resulted in 13 executions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, his words leave the impression California paid the entire $5 billion for a fraction of its hundreds of cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Steyer&#39;s&nbsp;claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash; The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc51bc76-832d-4387-956d-fa0a87051f25\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc51bc76-832d-4387-956d-fa0a87051f25</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-20T18:41:49.946604", "ruling_date": "2016-09-21T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did California spend $5 billion to execute 13 people?
