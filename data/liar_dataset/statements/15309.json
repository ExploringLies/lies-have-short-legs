The post is not based in fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a relatively minor point: The article referred to Pelosi, D-Calif., as the Senate majority leader when she is actually the House minority leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reported &quot;revelations&quot; are salacious but made up, saying Pelosi is accused of &quot;unwanted advances&quot; toward several staffers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article claims that Senate insiders told military publication <em>Army Time</em>s that there may soon be an opening for a new Minority Leader because of the suggested allegations. However, we didn&rsquo;t find any articles from the <em>Army Times</em> regarding this information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the fake news article, the allegations consist of at least five men and one woman complaining about Pelosi previously making unwanted advances that got swept under the rug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NrtOnline cited the right-wing publication Breitbart for breaking this news, but we found no reports by Breitbart regarding this story, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story includes more fictional details about cash payments and promotions, but they aren&rsquo;t worth repeating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence by credible news outlets or other sources regarding the truth behind this story. Pelosi&rsquo;s office also confirmed that she is&nbsp;not resigning and that nothing in the story is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-25T16:37:55.683187", "ruling_date": "2018-04-25T16:53:03", "ruling_headline": "No, House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi is not resigning", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-senate-minority-leader-nancy-pelosi-not-resigni", "ruling_link_text": "She's staying put ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NrtOnline, <a href=\"http://nrtonline.info/breaking-nancy-pelosi-to-resign-after-new-revelations/\">BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi to resign after new revelations</a>, April 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail interview with deputy chief of staff and spokesperson to Nancy Pelosi, Drew Hammill</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Nrt", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4294, "last_name": "Online", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "nrtonline", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/independent_group.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4294/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi to resign after new revelations.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "on a website", "statement_date": "2018-04-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
