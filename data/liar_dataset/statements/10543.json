Rather, we&rsquo;re looking specifically at whether he has changed his position in terms of supporting a right to work law in Wisconsin in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right-to-work laws -- derided by some opponents as &quot;right to work for less&quot; laws -- are in place in <a href=\"http://www.nrtw.org/rtws.htm\">24 states</a>. They&nbsp;prohibit businesses and unions from reaching labor deals that require workers to pay union fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2014/dec/04/right-work-fact-checkers-perspective/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>we have found</u></a> there is some evidence of economic advantage in right to work states.

The next day he alerted Walker&#39;s chief of staff, Eric Schutt, to the plan to act on the bill quickly. And the day after that, Walker announced he would sign the bill.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Fitzgerald, neither Walker nor Schutt discouraged him from putting the bill forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fitzgerald called Walker &quot;supportive&quot;
