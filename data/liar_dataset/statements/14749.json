But the details in the post aren&rsquo;t related to journalism: They highlight McCrummen&rsquo;s &quot;public criminal records in multiple states stretching across four time zones,&quot; including writing a &quot;fake check.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldn&rsquo;t her character come into question when it comes to making a 40-year-old sexual allegation against one of the most-hated, Steve Bannon-backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?&quot; the blogpost reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story was shared over 24,000 times and cited a 2011 <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/mikerobinsonpc/2011/10/05/washington-post-staff-writer-who-wrote-rick-perry-attack-piece-has-criminal-past/\">Red State</a> blog post that similarly sought to discredit McCrummen following a report that was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-perry-familys-hunting-camp-still-known-to-many-by-old-racially-charged-name/2011/10/01/gIQAOhY5DL_story.html\">critical of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, none of the charges speak to McCrummen&rsquo;s journalistic integrity. The only criminal violation and &quot;faking&quot; related to a bounced check written 25 years ago when McCrummen was in college, while the rest of her &quot;history&quot; encompassed traffic infractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCrummen was an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1992 when she wrote a $6.93 check that bounced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That was a bounced check was for groceries while Stephanie was in college, which she paid back,&quot; said Kristine Coratti, vice president of communications at the <em>Washington Post</em>, in response to our email inquiry to McCrummen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCrummen pleaded guilty to the criminal misdemeanor charge, appeared before a magistrate and paid it off, alongside a $50 fee, according to James Stanford, the Orange County Superior Court clerk.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Traffic violations</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The blogpost then pivots to McCrummen&rsquo;s traffic offenses, the first of which was for speeding in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona&rsquo;s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges,&quot; the post reads. &quot;After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traffic offenses can be criminal if the driver is found driving without a license or the excessive speed was not prudent for the conditions. But the court authorities doubt this was the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If it was criminal it would probably still be in the records because those are retained longer than civil traffic case, but we just can&rsquo;t know for sure,&quot; said Jennifer Ilten, executive secretary at the Scottsdale city court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heather Murphy, communications director at the Arizona Supreme Court, said the court where the fine was paid wasn&rsquo;t a &quot;criminal court,&quot; but rather, municipal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy confirmed that McCrummen owed -- and paid -- $321.30, according to court records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fine is fairly typical of a civil traffic violation for speeding or another moving violation, but I cannot state that as fact,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;This is not driving without a license or DUI &ndash; those fines begin in excess of $1,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Even knowing the fare amount, a big chunk of that could have been the collection fees,&quot; Ilten said. &quot;It was probably a lesser charge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy also explained that FARE enforcement is much less sinister than the post made it sound. It usually occurs when a person doesn&rsquo;t receive a citation because it went to an old address. A new citation is mailed to the new address when discovered. In this case, the ticket was entered for collection on Oct. 4, 2010, and paid in full on Oct. 23, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other two traffic tickets both occurred in Virginia and had been wiped from the courts. In Fairfax County, the post reported McCrummen failed to obey a highway sign -- an infraction, not a criminal offense. The same goes for Prince William County; the post said McCrummen drove at 46 miles an hour in a 25 mile per hour speed zone. That&rsquo;s also not a criminal offense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coratti declined to comment on McCrummen&rsquo;s traffic infractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A 100percentfedup.com blog post said McCrummen &quot;has a criminal history of &lsquo;faking.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The faking, here, isn&rsquo;t really faking at all -- and certainly not in a way that would question the veracity of this report. The reporter in question wrote a bounced check while in college in 1992 for $6.93. The reporter paid back the money and a $50 fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-14T17:57:50.544881", "ruling_date": "2017-11-14T17:50:14", "ruling_headline": "No, the Washington Post Roy Moore reporter doesn't have a history of 'faking'", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-washington-post-roy-moore-reporter-doesnt-have-", "ruling_link_text": "Once wrote a bounced $7 check", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>100PercentFedUp.com, <a href=\"https://100percentfedup.com/just-wapo-reporter-broke-news-judge-roy-moore-story-criminal-history-faking/\">JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of &quot;Faking&quot;</a>, Nov. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RedState.com, <a href=\"https://www.redstate.com/mikerobinsonpc/2011/10/05/washington-post-staff-writer-who-wrote-rick-perry-attack-piece-has-criminal-past/\">Washington Post Staff Writer Who Wrote Rick Perry Attack Piece Has Criminal Past</a>, Oct. 5, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with James Stanford, clerk of superior court of Orange County, North Carolina, Nov. 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kristine Coratti Kelly, vice president of communications and events at <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em>, Nov. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email interviews with Heather Murphy, Director of Communications Arizona Supreme Court and Administrative Office of the Courts, Nov. 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Jennifer Iltern, executive secretary of Scottsdale City Court, Nov. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PWCGov.org, <a href=\"http://www.pwcgov.org/government/courts/circuit/pages/misdemeanors-and-felonies.aspx\">Misdemeanors and felonies</a>, accessed Nov. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law.lis.virginia.gov, <a href=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter1/section18.2-8/\">VA Code Title 18.2</a>, accessed Nov. 14, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says a Washington Post reporter&nbsp;who broke news on Judge Roy Moore story has a criminal history of &quot;faking.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a blog post", "statement_date": "2017-11-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
