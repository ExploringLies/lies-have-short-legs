Rick Perry thinks states can do some things better than the federal government, including coordinating health care for its poorest residents.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a Dec. 19 interview with Kathleen McKinley, whose blog appears on the Houston Chronicle&#39;s website, Perry said the state has good ideas for delivering care effectively. As an example, he pointed to a proposal that Texas submitted to the federal government with the goal of reducing the number of uninsured residents by &quot;restructuring federal Medicaid funding.&quot; Medicaid uses federal and state funding to provide health insurance to low-income Americans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry went on: &quot;Unfortunately, this waiver, which presents a strategic alternative to continued reliance on government-run health care programs, has languished in a file cabinet at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry&#39;s description of the waiver proposal&#39;s status rang a bell here at PolitiFact Texas. In the spring, we rated as <a href=\"http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/may/01/rick-perry/perry-says-state-waiting-feds-act-health-care-prop/\">False</a> a statement Perry made in an April 15 interview with the <em>Texas Tribune</em> and <em>Newsweek </em>magazine that Texas has been waiting for more than two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to &quot;create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe confirmed that Texas had sought permission from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in April 2008 to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool intended to help some low-income Texans get private insurance. However, in August 2008, during George W. Bush&#39;s presidency, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the federal health agency, sent a letter to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission stating that &quot;a number of areas under this proposal have been identified as problematic&quot; &mdash; making it impossible for the federal agency to approve the proposal as written.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSince then, state and federal officials have gone back and forth, without the state submitting a revised proposal and with no ultimate resolution. A federal official told us April 22 that the ball was in the state&#39;s court, saying that as of that time, the waiver request wasn&#39;t considered complete.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur story also quoted a state official saying that the proposal would probably need to be adjusted afresh to the just-approved federal overhaul of health care.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEight months later, Perry appeared to be making the same claim, that the federal government &mdash; not the state &mdash; was responsible for the waiver request&#39;s stalled-out status. We wondered whether anything had changed since we last investigated this topic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot from the state&#39;s perspective. &quot;We still consider the proposal to be pending,&quot; said Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas health commission.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot from the view of the federal government, which still considers the proposal incomplete. Mary Kahn, a spokeswoman for CMS, told us that the agency had &quot;not yet received a revised proposal from the state.&quot; She declined to comment on Perry&#39;s statement that it&#39;s languishing in a file cabinet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry&#39;s office did not respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking elaboration on the governor&#39;s recent characterization.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSumming up: Perry&rsquo;s statement echoes a claim we rated False eight months ago. Significantly, the state has not revised its request to meet federal requirements, making this rerun worse than inaccurate.
