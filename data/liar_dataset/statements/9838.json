The 2013 figure is slightly higher than what Sanders said, but his claim is basically accurate on the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the measurement Sanders used may not be the best. Economists told us that it would be more useful to know what corporate taxes were as a percentage of gross domestic product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But looking at it that&nbsp;way, the general pattern also holds. In 1952, corporate taxes accounted for 5.9 percent of GDP, a figure that has fallen to 1.6 percent today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Sanders has a point that corporate tax collections have plummeted as a percentage of all taxes collected, even as corporate profits have hit record highs. But a range of economists offered two bits of cautionary context worth considering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>The year 1952 is somewhat cherry-picked</strong>. That year ranks third-highest in history for corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP. &quot;It was a time when the U.S. was the colossus of the world economy and faced very little competition from foreign-based firms,&quot; said Daniel Mitchell, a Cato Institute economist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, even as recently as 1979, corporate taxes accounted for 2.6 percent of GDP, a full percentage point higher than today. So the decline is real, even if you use a subsequent year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Today, most business income is taxed through the individual income tax code, rather than the corporate code.</strong> This concerns a distinction only a CPA could love. One type of corporation, a &quot;C-corporation,&quot; pays corporate income taxes on its profits. Another type, the &quot;S-corporation,&quot; pays taxes on its profits through the individual income-tax returns of the owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Changes in tax rates and rules for C- and S-corps contributed to more firms becoming S-corps and thus paying individual rather than corporate income tax,&quot; said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation. That has boosted individual income-tax collections and reduced corporate income-tax collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 1980 to 2010, the category of businesses that includes S-corporations, sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs has increased by 10.9 million to over 30 million, while the number of corporations has declined, Pomerlau said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means there are fewer corporations to pay the corporate income tax. In addition, the amount of business income generated by these types of businesses has risen as well, Pomerlau said. Between 1980 and 2010, this type of income has increased fivefold, from $320 billion to more than $1.6 trillion, he said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In fact, most recent data shows that (these) businesses are earning more total net income than traditional C-corporations,&quot; Pomerlau said. &quot;In 1980, it was the complete opposite.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed that looking at C-corporations alone produces a cloudy picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to say what share of revenue would come from corporate income tax today if those changes hadn&#39;t occurred,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said, &quot;In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue. Today, despite record-breaking profits, corporate taxes bring in less than 9 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders is right if you use the official numbers, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that the figure for individual income taxes now includes a significant chunk of taxes assessed on corporate profits. That muddies the otherwise clear picture Sanders tries to paint. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-28T16:39:51.248041", "ruling_date": "2014-08-28T17:16:41", "ruling_headline": "Bernie Sanders says tax share paid by corporations has fallen from 33% to 9% since 1952", "ruling_headline_slug": "bernie-sanders-says-tax-share-paid-corporations-ha", "ruling_link_text": "A whopper of a decline", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bernie Sanders, social media meme, received Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2015/assets/hist.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Budget of the U.S. Government, Historical Tables</u></a>,&quot; Fiscal Year 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, &quot;<a href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=cSh\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Corporate Profits After Tax (without IVA and CCAdj)/Gross Domestic Product,</u></a>&quot; accessed Aug. 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, &quot;<a href=\"http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CP/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Corporate Profits After Tax (without IVA and CCAdj),</u></a>&quot; accessed Aug. 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fortune</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/08/28/is-burger-kings-move-to-canada-a-raw-deal-for-u-s-taxpayers/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Is Burger King&rsquo;s move to Canada a raw deal for U.S. taxpayers?</u></a>&quot; Aug. 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kyle Pomerleau, economist with the Tax Foundation, Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Roberton Williams, fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Daniel Mitchell, senior fellow with the Cato Institute, Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Michael Briggs, communications director for Bernie Sanders, Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Bernie", "half_true_count": 28, "home_state": "Vermont", "id": 218, "last_name": "Sanders", "mostly_true_count": 46, "name_slug": "bernie-sanders", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "edition": "Vermont", "edition_slug": "vermont", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 65, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "Vermont Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/65/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/218/", "total_count": 129, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://sanders.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In 1952, the corporate income tax accounted for 33 percent of all federal tax revenue.
