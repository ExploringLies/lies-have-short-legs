Rand Paul invoked New Hampshire&#39;s state motto while speaking to its residents this week, seizing a chance to emphasize the idea that his libertarian-leaning ideals align with Granite State history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die, they didn&#39;t leave a lot of wiggle room,&quot; he said to a crowd in Milford&#39;s town hall in his first New Hampshire appearance since announcing his run for president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;New Hampshire founders didn&rsquo;t seek out the mushy middle. They admonished you to live free.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kentucky Republican didn&#39;t just use the phrase. He attempted to explain where it came from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it looks like he got a little mixed up along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Paul&rsquo;s New Hampshire advisors, but didn&rsquo;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Hampshire was one of the <a href=\"http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/usconstitution/a/original13states.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>original 13 states</u></a> and ratified the U.S. Constitution on June 21, 1788. Before that it was formed as a <a href=\"https://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/history.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>royal province in 1677</u></a>, and John Cutt was its first president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The words &quot;Live Free or Die,&quot; as cited by <a href=\"http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/3/3-mrg.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New Hampshire law</u></a>, were written by General John Stark on July 31, 1809 &ndash; long after New Hampshire became a state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A legendary military man, Stark offered the phrase as a toast. Because of his failing health, he declined an invitation to head up a reunion of the 1777 Battle of Bennington in Vermont, but left the group with those famous words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar invitation was extended again the following year, <a href=\"https://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/emblem.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>saying</u></a>, &quot;The toast, sir, which you sent us in 1809 will continue to vibrate with unceasing pleasure in our ears, &#39;Live Free or Die; Death Is Not the Worst of Evils.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It must still have been vibrating in 1945, when the motto was formally adopted by the state Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who &quot;the founders of New Hampshire&quot; are depends on your definition, but Stark isn&#39;t typically considered among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They could be the group that turned a community of towns into a <a href=\"https://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/history.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;royal province&quot;</u></a> in 1679 &ndash; 49 years before Stark was born. They could also be the Congress of New Hampshire, which created in 1776 <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nh09.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an independent constitution</u></a>. Or they could be the people that ratified the U.S. Constitutiona few years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of those groups included Stark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, a strong liberty-oriented sentiment existed in the state long before Stark, and even before it was called New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the earliest explorers of New Hampshire was Captain John Smith of England, who upon seeing the land is <a href=\"https://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/history.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>quoted as saying</u></a>, &quot;Here should be no landlords to rack us with high rents, or extorted fines to consume us. Here every man may be a master of his own labor and land in a short time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in 1775, less than a year before New Hampshirites drew up their own constitution, Patrick Henry uttered famous words, &quot;<a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/patrick.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Give me liberty or give me death</u></a>,&quot; that people outside of New Hampshire often confuse with the state motto. Henry delivered those remarks during a speech in Virginia during the American Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fair to assume liberty, and independence from the the royal rule of England, was on the minds of New Hampshire&rsquo;s founders at the time it became a state, but not specifically Stark&rsquo;s words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s motto is often invoked by politicians, like it was last month by Sen. Ted Cruz and in February by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, <a href=\"http://hosted2.ap.org/NHCON/c26bcf5af6bd4fda84f3e73888f72aef/Article_2015-04-08-US--GOP-2016-Paul-New%20Hampshire%20Motto/id-830962e639b64ca4a0ba7775d0ced06b\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>as the Associated Press reported</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Paul isn&#39;t the first one to get the facts about Stark wrong. In 2011, Vice President Joe Biden referred to Stark as a former New Hampshire governor. That same year, Perry referred to him as &quot;John Spark,&quot; Holly Ramer of The Association Press reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rand Paul said &quot;the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Hampshire&rsquo;s motto is attributed to General John Stark, who was instrumental in defending it and the other colonies. But he wasn&rsquo;t a founder of the state, and the motto wasn&rsquo;t adopted until well after his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the original 13 states to ratify the U.S. constitution, it&rsquo;s not a stretch to think New Hampshire&rsquo;s founders were focused on liberty, but not specifically the words of Stark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-10T18:22:55.951003", "ruling_date": "2015-04-10T18:17:33", "ruling_headline": "Rand Paul attributes NH motto 'Live Free or Die' to its founders", "ruling_headline_slug": "liberty-themed-speech-rand-paul-attributed-nh-mott", "ruling_link_text": "Words and motto came after founding", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>New Hampshire revised statutes, <a href=\"http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/3/3-mrg.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/3/3-mrg.htm</u></a>, April 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Hampshire Almanac, <a href=\"https://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/history.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>https://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/history.html</u></a>, April 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constitution of New Hampshire, <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nh09.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nh09.asp</u></a>, April 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, <a href=\"http://hosted2.ap.org/NHCON/c26bcf5af6bd4fda84f3e73888f72aef/Article_2015-04-08-US--GOP-2016-Paul-New%20Hampshire%20Motto/id-830962e639b64ca4a0ba7775d0ced06b\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Paul mixes up New Hampshire history in invoking state motto</u></a>, April 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SeacoastNH.com, <a href=\"http://www.seacoastnh.com/framers/stark.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Framers of freedom: John Stark</u></a>, April 10, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "Candidate for U.S. Senate and physician", "false_count": 9, "first_name": "Rand", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "Kentucky", "id": 744, "last_name": "Paul", "mostly_true_count": 13, "name_slug": "rand-paul", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rand_Paul.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/744/", "total_count": 56, "true_count": 12, "website": "http://www.paul.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a town hall meeting in Milford, NH", "statement_date": "2015-04-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 36, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/36/", "subject": "Patriotism", "subject_slug": "patriotism", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
