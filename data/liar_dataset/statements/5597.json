New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year. That&#39;s every year, year after year, 30,000 of our best prepared, most educated students leave the state for other states.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAre tens of thousands of college students leaving the Garden State? Yes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA report released last year by the New Jersey Higher Education Task Force, a committee appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, said: &quot;In part because of a lack of college capacity, New Jersey has a too-long history of losing more college-bound students than attend in-state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Center for Education Statistics, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Education, keeps tabs on where students choose to pursue education after high school.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fall 2008, the most recent data available, 36,135 New Jersey residents enrolled for the first time in an out-of-state institution granting at least an associate&rsquo;s degree. At the same time 5,268 first-time freshmen came to New Jersey, for a net loss of 30,867 students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDiane Reed, a spokeswoman for Montclair State University, confirmed that&rsquo;s the data Cole was referencing in the television interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn comparison, New Jersey lost a net total of 29,559 of first-time freshmen in fall 2006. A decade before that the state lost 20,005 students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Center for Education Statistics also narrows the data to focus on freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and freshmen attending a four-year institution who graduated high school in the last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth groups experienced a net loss of students close to the figure Cole cited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey lost a net total of 27,819 freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and 27,343 freshmen attending four-year institutions who graduated high school in the last year, according to the most recent data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy all three measures, more students left New Jersey then came to the state in the fall of 2008 for a postsecondary education than any other state in the nation. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president of Montclair State University said: &quot;New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the most recent federal education statistics, 36,135 first-time freshmen students left New Jersey and 5,268 came to the state. That&rsquo;s a net loss of 30,867.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd when narrowing &nbsp;the data to freshmen who graduated in the &nbsp;past 12 months or students attending four-year institutions, the net loss is still more than 27,000 students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCole&rsquo;s on the mark with this statement.
