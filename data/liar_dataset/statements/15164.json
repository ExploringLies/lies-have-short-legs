Despite the fact that the Politico article stated, &quot;Biden hasn&rsquo;t been actively exploring the presidential options himself, and is far from making any decision about whether he&rsquo;ll run,&quot; the Your News Wire article writes that it says that Biden is preparing for his campaign announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no evidence that is happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hoax goes on to say that Biden has chosen Obama -- whom he used to serve under as vice president -- to be his running mate. The story claims that it would be legal under constitutional law for the two to run together, but two-term presidents have traditionally taken an unspoken vow to retire from public life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxii\">22nd Amendment</a> prohibits a president from being elected for more than two terms, but it does not explicitly mention a former president being elected as vice president. However, the <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xii\">12th Amendment</a>&nbsp;states that &quot;no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unspoken vow two-term presidents take is also exaggerated. There is no obligation for a two-term president to stay out of public life. Since he left office, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/barack-obama/life-after-white-house-how-obama-spent-his-first-year-n838951\">Obama</a> has given <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/24/first-post-white-house-speech-obama-avoids-talk-trump/100838360/\">public speeches at universities</a> and is working on new books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article goes on to quote two different<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/377556-biden-aides-prepping-for-2020-run-report\"> real stories</a> from <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/364702-expand-all-print-all-in-new-window-biden-on-running-in-2020-i-may\">the Hill</a>&nbsp;newspaper,&nbsp;but it only provides a link to one changing the context of the quotes given in different stories regarding speculation of Biden&rsquo;s bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quotes from Biden&rsquo;s aides about Biden and Obama reclaiming the White House were also made up.
