His organization, Luntz Global, polled 945 gun owners nationwide in May 2012, half of whom were gun owners who were &quot;current or lapsed&quot; members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe poll showed that &quot;gun owners&rsquo; knowledge of existing laws is tenuous,&quot; Luntz Global&rsquo;s report says. &quot;Over half (53 percent ) of non-NRA members and 57 percent of NRA members believe the statement, &lsquo;Everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check to complete the purchase&rsquo; is true.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reality is that background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for those by private sellers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe White House wants to require criminal background checks <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf\">for all gun sales</a>. The National Rifle Association, which supports the current background check requirement, has suggested that an expansion of the law might be a step toward <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2013/privatesales.aspx?s=&amp;st=&amp;ps=\">gun confiscation</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> What the NRA says</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted NRA spokesmen to ask for their evaluation of Speier&rsquo;s claim, but they didn&rsquo;t respond.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/legislation/federal-legislation/2010/update-on-bogus-%E2%80%9Cpoll%E2%80%9D-of-nra-members.aspx\">an NRA response</a>, however, to a similar poll by Mayors Against Illegal Guns conducted by Frank Luntz in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Web post calls Bloomberg an &quot;anti-gun politician-activist,&quot; and attacks <a href=\"http://www.luntzglobal.com/Communication_Strategists/Team/Frank_Luntz/\">Luntz</a>, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/polls/wat/archive/wat082800.htm\">decade-old criticism</a> from two polling organizations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn other words, the NRA attacked the source of the previous poll, not the results.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked for other polls to see if they exposed weakness in the poll&rsquo;s conclusions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe didn&rsquo;t immediately find a survey that addressed gun owners&rsquo; knowledge of existing laws. But the Luntz poll also asked about support for &quot;requiring a criminal background check of anyone purchasing a gun.&quot; The poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of NRA members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRecent independent polls show similar numbers. A <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/01/14/in-gun-control-debate-several-options-draw-majority-support/1/\">Pew Research Center</a> poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of gun owners favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks &mdash; nearly identical to the Luntz poll.

It showed a majority of those NRA gun owners believe &quot;everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check.&quot; While we didn&rsquo;t find recent polls asking a similar question, we did find other polls showing that NRA members support background checks for all, including private purchases and purchases at gun shows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt should be clarified that the Luntz poll results were for current <em>and </em>former NRA members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-23T13:25:40.336260", "ruling_date": "2013-01-23T15:53:43", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
