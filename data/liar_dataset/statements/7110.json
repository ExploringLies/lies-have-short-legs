Scott Walker, a vocal critic of the law, seemed to bow to legal and political realities on Nov. 16, 2012, when he announced his administration was &quot;complying with the law, whether we like it or not.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement was part of an announcement that he would not create a state-run insurance marketplace to put the law into effect. Rather, Walker told reporters, he would let the federal government run it, another of the options under the law. <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-wont-create-health-care-exchange-defers-to-feds-3d7m2et-179663491.html\">Democrats and some prominent business organizations</a> wanted a state exchange, arguing it could be better tailored to Wisconsin&rsquo;s needs, and any problems could be dealt with at the local level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Sen. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/erpenbach/Pages/default.aspx\">Jon Erpenbach</a> (D-Middleton) issued <a href=\"http://thewheelerreport.com/releases/November12/1116erpenbach.pdf\">a statement</a> criticizing the decision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I am disappointed that Governor Walker does not have enough faith in the people of Wisconsin to help create a health insurance marketplace that best fits our needs as a state,&quot; Erpenbach said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat critique was a common refrain from Democrats that day. But Erpenbach added a twist that caught our eye.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker, he said, &quot;has led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn&rsquo;t implement an exchange, ObamaCare doesn&rsquo;t happen here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The background</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA core of conservative critics of &quot;Obamacare&quot; believes that states maintain the ability to challenge -- and possibly block -- the federal health care reform law if they decline to run the exchanges.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324735104578122741540428344.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">legal theory</a> holds that an unintended loophole in the law could block federally run exchanges from functioning legally in states. The state of Oklahoma <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-19/oklahoma-attorney-general-revises-health-care-lawsuit.html\">made a version of the argument</a> in amended court filings in September 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWisconsin tea-party groups <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/letter2.pdf\">lobbied Walker</a> not to create an exchange in part by raising this issue.

Wisconsin has been a leader and innovator in health care reform for two decades, and we have achieved a high level of health insurance coverage without federal mandates. When job creators and Wisconsin families are facing difficult times it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to commit to a federal health care mandate that will result in hidden taxes for Wisconsin&rsquo;s families, increased health care costs and insurance premiums, and more uncertainty in the private sector.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\tIn that statement, Walker directly linked the exchange decision to &quot;stopping&quot; Obamacare in Wisconsin and not committing to it. And he did not explain the federal role.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\t<strong>June 2012:</strong> After the Supreme Court upheld much of the law, Walker issued a statement saying that &quot;Wisconsin will not take any action to implement Obamacare.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\tHe pinned his hopes for stopping it on the fall elections, and made it sound like the last hope: &quot;I am hopeful that political changes in Washington, D.C., later this year ultimately end the implementation of this law at the federal level. If there is no political remedy from Washington and the law moves forward, it would require the majority of people in Wisconsin to pay more money for less health care.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\tHe again pledged not to phase in any parts of the law pending the election outcome.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\tAround the same time, we fact-checked a Walker op-ed piece in the Washington Post. We rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-study-shows-federal-health-care-/\">False</a> his claim that a study showed that Obamacare would &quot;devastate Wisconsin&quot; by pushing people off employer-sponsored insurance, driving up premiums, increasing dependency and making 122,000 people ineligible for Medicaid.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\tAfter the Nov. 6, 2012 elections, Walker contemplated his final decision on a state or federal exchange.

Frank Lasee, R- De Pere, pressed him to let the feds do it -- in part hoping to keep alive a possible legal challenge.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-TOP: 0pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 6pt\">\r\n\tWalker, though, made no mention that we could find of that legal option when he announced on Nov. 16, 2012, he&rsquo;d let the feds run it.
