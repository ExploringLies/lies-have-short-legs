We decided to check the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At PolitiFact we typically fact-check politicians. But we also investigate claims by <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-falsely-claims-jacksonville-shooter-/\">media pundits</a> from <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-falsely-claims-jacksonville-shooter-/\">Rush Limbaugh</a> to <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/sep/12/joe-scarborough/will-trump-gop-create-more-debt-one-year-first-200/\">Joe Scarborough</a>, along with athletes and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/09/colin-kaepernick/nfls-colin-kaepernick-incorrectly-credits-winston-/\">celebrities</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/09/colin-kaepernick/nfls-colin-kaepernick-incorrectly-credits-winston-/\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, who wield a lot of political influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case we fact-checked a California-based company that&rsquo;s very influential with the goal of holding it accountable for what it says, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Apple declined to respond on-the-record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s Apple Watch Series 4 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/you-can-preorder-the-apple-watch-series-4-today-starting-at-399/\">starts at $399</a> and includes a model for $499. The product starts shipping later this month, though the electrocardiogram feature won&rsquo;t be available until sometime later this year, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850660/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-electrocardiogram-health-2018\">news reports</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strongest push back against Williams&rsquo; statement comes from Vic Gundotra, CEO of Mountain View-based AliveCor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His company also produces over-the-counter ECG devices and has been doing so for several years. Specifically, it makes an FDA-cleared band for the Apple Watch, called <a href=\"https://store.alivecor.com/products/kardiaband\">KardiaBand</a>, which sells for $199, as well as a version that attaches to a smartphone, called Kardia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CEO claims Apple used &#39;alternative facts&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We were watching [the announcement], and we were surprised,&quot; Gundotra <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/alivecor-ceo-vic-gundotra-apple-watch-series-4-2018-9\">told Business Insider</a> on Thursday. &quot;It was amazing, it was like us being on stage, with the thing we&#39;ve been doing for 7 years,&quot; referring to AliveCor&#39;s product for detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib), a tough-to-spot heart disorder that manifests as an irregular, often quick heart rate that can cause poor circulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Although when they said they were first to go over-the-counter, we were surprised,&quot; Gundotra continued. &quot;Apple doesn&#39;t like to admit they copy anyone, even in the smallest things. Their own version of alternative facts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked AliveCor about the issue, a spokesman provided a toned-down statement from Gundotra:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Apple&rsquo;s advances in cardiac monitoring validate the need for this mobile ECG technology -- a path which AliveCor paved with our Kardia products,&quot; the statement said. &quot;These still stand as the first and most clinically validated over-the-counter FDA-cleared consumer ECG devices.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/apple_2016_ap_image.jpg\" style=\"height:600px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Apple unveiled its new Apple Watch Series 4 in San Francisco this week. Associated Press file photo. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Statement falls short?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to Gundotra&rsquo;s comments, a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/technology/apple-event-live-iphone-watch-ios12.html\">report</a> called out Williams&rsquo; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So did an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/apples-watch-isnt-the-first-with-an-ekg-reader-but-it-will-matter-to-more-consumers/\">article at TechCrunch.com</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While Apple loves to be first to things, that statement is false. AliveCor has held the title of first since 2014 for its KardiaMobile device, a $100 stick-like metal unit you attach to the back of a smartphone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article links to a <a href=\"https://www.alivecor.com/press/press_release/alivecor-receives-fda-over-the-counter-clearance-for-its-heart-monitor/\">2014 AliveCor press release</a> announcing it had received federal over-the-counter clearance for the AliveCor Heart Monitor, a single-channel ECG recorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subtle difference?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/13/the-apple-watch-got-a-heart-health-upgrade---your-questions-answered.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain\">CNBC article</a> presents what it calls a subtle difference between AliveCor and Apple&rsquo;s new product:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It says: &quot;Once a consumer buys an AliveCor device, they take an EKG reading (via a smartphone attachment or their Apple Watch band), and wait until a doctor unlocks it within 24 hours to get an initial reading on the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple designed its system differently. The FDA cleared the company to provide these readings to consumers right away, allowing users to share the results with a physician if they choose.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning back to AliveCor, the company&rsquo;s website says a physician&rsquo;s reading is necessary only for the first test of its product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Due to regulatory necessity, new U.S. accounts are required to have their first EKG reviewed by a U.S. board-certified cardiologist free of charge (a $19 value within the app). You will be blocked for up to 24 hours from EKG features until the review is complete (although it is often much faster).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said the new Apple Watch Series 4 &quot;is the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That claim ignores the fact that start-up AliveCor has produced over-the-counter ECG devices for several years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AliveCor device requires a cardiologist to review the first test, while that won&rsquo;t be necessary for the Apple watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a very subtle distinction and not enough to stand up Williams&rsquo; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-14T15:02:36.773823", "ruling_date": "2018-09-14T12:36:29", "ruling_headline": "Apple offbeat in claim about \u2018first\u2019 EKG consumer product ", "ruling_headline_slug": "apple-beat-claim-about-first-ekg-consumer-product", "ruling_link_text": "Smaller start-up has produced EKG device for years", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jeff Williams, Apple&rsquo;s chief operating officer, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cE5kA6XDSY\">speech</a>, Sept. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannah Boss, spokeswoman for AliveCor, email exchange, Sept. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AliveCor, press release, <a href=\"https://www.alivecor.com/press/press_release/alivecor-receives-fda-over-the-counter-clearance-for-its-heart-monitor/\">ALIVECOR RECEIVES FDA OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARANCE FOR ITS HEART MONITOR</a>, Feb. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/technology/apple-event-live-iphone-watch-ios12.html\">Apple Unveils Bigger iPhones at Higher Prices, and a Heart-Tracking Watch</a>, Sept. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TechCrunch.com, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/12/iphone-xs-announced.html\">Apple&rsquo;s Watch isn&rsquo;t the first with an EKG reader but it will matter to more consumers</a>, Sept. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Insider, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/alivecor-ceo-vic-gundotra-apple-watch-series-4-2018-9\">&#39;Apple doesn&rsquo;t like to admit they copy anyone, even in the smallest things&#39;
