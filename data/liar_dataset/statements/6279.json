Sounds like those young whippersnappers aren&rsquo;t spending much time behind the wheel of Daddy&rsquo;s T-Bird.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe referendum is up for a vote July 31 and would raise $7.2 billion over 10 years to upgrade roads and transit across the region.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called up Dickerson and took a closer look at the data, which comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Household Travel Survey tracks how and why people travel. It takes place sporadically. The most recent ones were conducted in 2001 and 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn April of this year, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of state public interest research groups, and Frontier Group, an environmental think tank, issued &quot;Transportation and the New Generation,&quot; a report that analyzed data from this and other surveys. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found Dickerson used the correct percentage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report found that the average number of miles traveled on transit by a person in this age group increased by 40 percent between 2001 and 2009. Our own analysis of NHTS data and the report&rsquo;s calculation confirms this. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, the survey&rsquo;s other findings indicate these bright young things are relying on ways to travel that don&rsquo;t involve a car. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number of bike trips per person in Generation Y is up about 27 percent, NHTS data said. Walking increased about 16 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the average number of trips these youngsters take in personal vehicles declined about 18 percent, according to the survey. The miles they travel is down 23 percent. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBackers of public transit list a host of reasons why.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report says higher gas prices have pushed younger people to try other means of transportation, as have more stringent state age requirements for driver&rsquo;s licenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDarnell Grisby, director of policy development and research with the American Public Transportation Association, a transit industry group, mentioned findings by a real estate market research company that show that members of Generation Y overwhelmingly prefer walkable communities, whether in the suburbs or city. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, the share of teenagers with driver&rsquo;s licenses has dropped in recent decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1983, about 87 percent of 19-year-olds had their licenses, according to a University of Michigan study. By 2008, 75 percent did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut one NHTS finding about transit use made us wonder whether the dramatic statistic Dickerson used during the debate told the whole story. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the average number of person miles that younger people travel on transit skyrocketed, the number of trips they took on transit did not. These increased by only about 4 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt appears that 16- to 34-year-olds are hopping on public trains and buses slightly more often but are taking much longer trips.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy might this be? Baruch Feigenbaum is a transportation policy analyst for the Reason Foundation, a think tank that favors free-market solutions to policy issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince such a small percentage of Americans use transit on their daily commutes, a small jump in the number of people who ride buses and trains might translate into a big percentage increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;While transit usage has increased, the gains may not be as impressive as they appear,&quot; &nbsp;Feigenbaum said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow do we rule?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that the number of per capita passenger miles traveled did increase by 40 percent, the number Dickerson used.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Dickerson&rsquo;s use of the word &quot;ridership&quot; might have led viewers to think that younger people are taking 40 percent more trips on transit. This number ticked up by only about 4 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy either NHTS measure, it&rsquo;s fair to say that younger people are leaving Daddy&rsquo;s T-Bird in the driveway and relying more heavily on transit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Dickerson could have been much more precise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this reason, Dickerson earns a Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-17T16:34:00.445687", "ruling_date": "2012-07-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Transportation tax supporter says transit ridership by younger people jumped", "ruling_headline_slug": "transportation-tax-supporter-says-transit-ridershi", "ruling_link_text": "Mileage skyrockets, trips don't", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPBA.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pba.org/post/t-splost-debate-hosted-wabe\">T-SPLOST Debate hosted by WABE</a>,&quot; July 10, 2012, www.pba.org/post/t-splost-debate-hosted-wabe<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Jeff Dickerson, communications consultant, Citizens for Transportation Mobility, July 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-right: 30pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tFrontier Group, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.frontiergroup.org/reports/fg/transportation-and-new-generation\">Transportation and the New Generation: Why Young People Are Driving Less and What It Means for Transportation Policy</a>,&quot; April 2012, www.frontiergroup.org/reports/fg/transportation-and-new-generation</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Tony Dutzik, senior policy analyst, Frontier Group, July 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Darnell Grisby, director of policy development and research, American Public Transportation Association, July 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone and email interviews, Baruch Feigenbaum, transportation policy analyst, Reason Foundation, July 13 and 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Michigan Transportation Research Institute Research Review, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.umtri.umich.edu/content/rr42_4.pdf\">Driving Forces</a>,&quot; &nbsp;October&ndash;December 2011, <a href=\"http://www.umtri.umich.edu/content/rr42_4.pdf\">www.umtri.umich.edu/content/rr42_4.pdf</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert Charles Lesser &amp; Co., &quot;Suburbia, Soccer Moms, SUVs and Smart Growth,&quot; Feb. 2, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jeff", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 1928, "last_name": "Dickerson", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "jeff-dickerson", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jeff_Dickerson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1928/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tAccording to a national survey, transit &quot;ridership&quot; among people age 16 to 34 increased 40 percent between 2001 and 2009.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an online debate", "statement_date": "2012-07-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
