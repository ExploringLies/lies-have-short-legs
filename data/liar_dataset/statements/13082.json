Period,&quot; Trump said while briefly addressing the subject at the end of a campaign event at his newly built hotel in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve separately ruled this a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/16/donald-trump/full-flop-donald-trump-abandons-barack-obama-birth/\">Full Flop</a>. But Trump&rsquo;s other remarks on the so-called &quot;birther&quot; controversy have inspired fact-checks of their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump prefaced his statement about Obama&rsquo;s birthplace by saying, &quot;Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated the first part of that claim&nbsp;that &quot;Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/16/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim-hillary-clinton-/\">False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll fact-check the assertion that Trump &quot;finished it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t hear back from the Trump campaign, but the evening before Trump&rsquo;s announcement in Washington, Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser with the campaign, sent out a news release saying in part, &quot;In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it appears that the campaign&rsquo;s argument is that Trump pushed for Obama to release the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf\">long form of his Hawaii birth certificate</a> on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/us/politics/28obama.html\">April 27, 2011</a>, several years after the birther controversy bubbled up. Previously, a shorter version of the document had been available, but skeptics had been calling for the full document to be released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump himself had made this case as early as Aug. 22, 2013, when he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/370646948081975296\">tweeted</a>, &quot;Why are people upset w/ me over Pres Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate? I got him to release it, or whatever it was, when nobody else could!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for Trump&rsquo;s argument to hold water, we see two conditions that have to be met. First, did Trump &quot;finish&quot; advocating for the birther viewpoint once Obama released the long-form birth certificate? And second, did Obama&rsquo;s release of the long-form certificate &quot;finish&quot; the idea among American voters that Obama was born outside the United States?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both cases, the answer is no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump&rsquo;s continued&nbsp;birther tweets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slate has produced a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/09/16/donald_trump_s_birther_tweets_in_order.html\">comprehensive index</a> to the tweets by Trump -- all made after Obama&rsquo;s document release in 2011 -- in which the real-estate magnate either openly advocated birtherism or promoted skepticism about the official story of Obama&rsquo;s birth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list includes about three dozen examples between November 2011 and November 2014. Here&rsquo;s a sampling:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/225258011894104065\">July 17, 2012</a></strong>: &quot;I wonder what the answer is on @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\">BarackObama</a>&#39;s college application to the question: place of birth?

Release your records, Mr. President!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/226317290239582208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 20, 2012</a></strong>: &quot;With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\">@BarackObama</a> listing himself as &quot;Born in Kenya&quot; in 1999 http://bit.ly/JaHQW0 HI laws allowed him to produce a fake certificate. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCAM?src=hash\">#SCAM</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/232572505238433794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Aug. 6, 2012</a></strong>: &quot;An &#39;extremely credible source&#39; has called my office and told me that<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\"> @BarackObama</a>&#39;s birth certificate is a fraud.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/240116141446537216\">Aug. 27, 2012</a></strong>: &quot;Why do the Republicans keep apologizing on the so called &quot;birther&quot; issue?

Hilary couldn&#39;t, McCain couldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/508194635270062080\">Sept. 6, 2014</a></strong>: &quot;Attention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama&#39;s college records (destroyed?) and check &lsquo;place of birth&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Public opinion about Obama&rsquo;s birthplace</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The birther controversy never actually ended, either, judging by the polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, the birth certificate release itself didn&#39;t eliminate skepticism within the public about Obama&rsquo;s birthplace -- not even close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least two surveys looked at the question shortly before and shortly after Obama&rsquo;s document release. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147530/obama-birth-certificate-convinces-not-skeptics.aspx\">Gallup</a> asked whether respondents would say Obama was &quot;probably or definitely born in another country&quot; and found that the number dropped from 24 percent before the release in April 2011 to 13 percent after the release in May 2011. And <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2012/07/11/birthers-are-still-back/\">YouGov</a> asked whether &quot;Barack Obama was born in the United States.&quot; Before the release, 15 percent of respondent said &quot;false,&quot; a number that dropped to 13 percent after the release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirteen percent is not a trivial number of people in a nation of more than 300 million people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As time went on, polls by <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2012/07/11/birthers-are-still-back/\">YouGov</a> actually found rising numbers of respondents answering &quot;false&quot; &quot;Barack Obama was born in the United States&quot; -- 17 percent in January 2012 and 20 percent in July 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as recently as September 2015, a <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/12/iranpoll.pdf\">CNN/Opinion Research Corp.</a> poll found 13 percent answering &quot;another country&quot; when asked, &quot;Where was Barack Obama born, as far as you know?&quot; That poll was taken more than four years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said of the birther controversy, &quot;I finished it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In no credible sense is this true. Trump didn&rsquo;t &quot;finish&quot; fanning the flames of birther conspiracies once Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011 -- he kept tweeting about it for at least another three and a half years. And a core group of Americans hasn&rsquo;t &quot;finished&quot; expressing birther sentiments. As recently as a year ago, various polls have found that 13 percent of Americans supported the viewpoint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f8a8c00a-de79-480b-8444-2e5f66aab040\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f8a8c00a-de79-480b-8444-2e5f66aab040</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-16T12:31:45.225615", "ruling_date": "2016-09-16T14:06:00", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that he 'finished' the Obama birther talk", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-he-finished-obama-b", "ruling_link_text": "Kept tweeting about it, and many still believe it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-donald-trump-finally-concedes-that-1474040149-htmlstory.html\">remarks</a> in Washington, D.C., <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4957593?3\">Sept. 16, 2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump campaign, <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-campaign-statement\">statement</a>, Sept. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slate.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/09/16/donald_trump_s_birther_tweets_in_order.html\">All of Donald Trump&#39;s Birther Tweet</a>s,&quot;
