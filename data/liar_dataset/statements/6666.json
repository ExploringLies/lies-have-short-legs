Jobs? No &mdash; changes to student loans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClinton got down into details in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech to nominate President Barack Obama for a second term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStudent loan legislation under Obama, he said, &quot;lowers the cost of federal student loans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And even more important,&quot; he told them, &quot;it gives students the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe argued that would mean students wouldn&rsquo;t have to drop out of college for fear they couldn&rsquo;t repay their debt, and would be free to pursue jobs of &quot;modest income&quot; such as teaching, policing or practicing small-town medicine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not checking those implications, but rather his characterization of the policy itself: Did Obama give students &quot;the right to repay those loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Health care and education</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president signed <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ152/pdf/PLAW-111publ152.pdf\">student loan legislation</a> in March 2010 as part of a larger package that updated his <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/obama-signs-bill-on-student-loans-health-care/\">attention-grabbing</a> health care law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPreviously, the government had paid private banks fees to provide federal loans to college students. The new law got rid of the middlemen, freeing up $68 billion over 11 years for Pell Grants and other programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt also changed loan repayment terms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe government already had in place an &quot;income-based repayment plan&quot; that let students cap payments at 15 percent of their income above living expenses, and forgave remaining debt if they made those payments for 25 years. Under <a href=\"http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based\"> the new law</a>, payments dropped to 10 percent, with debt forgiven after 20 years, or half that long for some public service workers such as teachers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe changes apply to new borrowers as of 2008 and haven&rsquo;t kicked in yet, though they will by early next year, said <a href=\"http://newamerica.net/user/227\">Jason Delisle</a>, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation who worked on the Republican staff of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> &lsquo;Clear, fixed, low&rsquo;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, while &quot;10 percent&quot; may seem to fit the bill for a clear, fixed, low portion of income, the repayment plan is actually a little more complicated than that &mdash; mostly in borrowers&rsquo; favor. That&rsquo;s because the plan lets borrowers deduct 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold from their incomes before calculating the 10 percent payment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the rate for borrowers making less than $100,000 annually with a household size of one is actually less than 5 percent of total income, Delisle calculated, while it&rsquo;s nearly 9 percent for higher income households.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe payments are adjusted each year based on borrowers&rsquo; income and family size, requiring annual documentation &mdash; not quite as simple as Clinton made it sound. And borrowers <a href=\"http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based\">may have to pay taxes</a> on the amount of their debt canceled or forgiven.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClinton said the president gave students &quot;the right to repay (federal) loans as a clear, fixed, low percentage of their income for up to 20 years.&quot; That&rsquo;s a reasonable characterization of a law the president signed in March 2010 that goes into effect by early next year for newer borrowers. But Clinton&rsquo;s use of the word &quot;clear&quot; does oversimplify a somewhat more complicated reality that students will face an annually adjusted payment requiring paperwork on income and family size.
