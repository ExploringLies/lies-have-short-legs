The posts all read roughly the same, claiming that Robinson was charged &quot;for accepting money from the federal government under false pretenses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story stokes reader ire by admonishing Robinson for attempting to take money she didn&rsquo;t deserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While it may not have been her idea to ask for a $160K pension for being the Obama daughters&rsquo; &lsquo;caretaker,&rsquo; she was the one who filled out the paperwork and signed her name,&quot; the posts read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several of these links were flagged by Facebook users for being potentially fake, as part of the social media company&rsquo;s efforts to prune fake news from readers&rsquo; news feeds. The various links that repurpose the same post have been shared on Facebook at least 17,000 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know this particular claim is fake, because it comes from a website that makes up its content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-obamas-mother-in-law-charged-with-larceny-and-fraud/\">originally posted on March 16</a> at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which has been the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/28/blog-posting/trump-did-not-give-every-working-american-612-thro/\">source of several</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/09/blog-posting/image-obama-handcuffs-wiretapping-trump-fake-photo/\">fake news stories</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/13/blog-posting/it-trap-story-fbi-issued-warrant-obama-trump-wiret/\">that we&rsquo;ve</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/31/blog-posting/no-meryl-streeps-anti-trump-rant-didnt-cost-her-ha/\">previously checked</a>. These kinds of posts end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without attribution about its origin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn&rsquo;t indicate this or any other story is fake, but its <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/about-us/\">About Us link</a> notes that &quot;all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the whole idea that Robinson was at all eligible for a federal pension for being a caretaker of the former first family&rsquo;s children is entirely wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robinson was a former bank secretary and stay-at-home mother to Michelle Obama and her brother Craig. She <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/us/politics/10marian.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FRobinson%2C%20Marian\">did move into the White House in 2009</a>, and has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-elusive-mrs-r-marian-robinson-the-white-houses-not-so-typical-live-in-grandma/2014/03/31/72f7547a-b6c1-11e3-a7c6-70cf2db17781_story.html?utm_term=.535c1d3aa432\">helped raise her granddaughters</a>. But she didn&rsquo;t draw a salary and wasn&rsquo;t on any kind of government payroll for doing that. Since she was never a federal employee, she doesn&rsquo;t qualify for any government pension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org is building on a claim from October 2016 that originated on BostonTribune.com. That website said Robinson was allowed to collect the $160,000 pension once the Obamas left the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the story being shared on several other fake news sites, there&rsquo;s no actual pension for Robinson to collect. We rated that statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/10/blog-posting/fake-news-first-grandma-marian-robinson-not-gettin/\">Pants On Fire</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org report appears to acknowledge there is no pension for the first grandma (or at least not a legal one). Instead, the post unleashes outrage over Robinson&rsquo;s alleged attempt to collect money not owed to her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we have here is one fake news website posting a contrived follow-up to another fake news website&rsquo;s false report. Robinson is not collecting a pension, and she hasn&rsquo;t been charged with a crime for <em>trying </em>to collect a pension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-23T10:30:18.382127", "ruling_date": "2017-03-23T10:31:25", "ruling_headline": "Former \u2018First Grandma\u2019 Marian Robinson caught up in another fake news hoax", "ruling_headline_slug": "former-first-grandma-marian-robinson-caught-anothe", "ruling_link_text": "Another accusation about false pension", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>FlashNewsCorner.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://flashnewscorner.com/obamas-mother-law-charged-larceny-fraud/\">BREAKING: Obama&rsquo;s Mother-In-Law Charged With Larceny And Fraud</a>,&quot; March 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-obamas-mother-in-law-charged-with-larceny-and-fraud/\">BREAKING: Obama&rsquo;s Mother In Law Charged With Larceny And Fraud</a>,&quot; March 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/10/blog-posting/fake-news-first-grandma-marian-robinson-not-gettin/\">Fake news: First grandma Marian Robinson is not getting $160,000 annual pension</a>,&quot; Jan. 10, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says &quot;(Barack) Obama&rsquo;s mother-in-law charged with larceny and fraud.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Internet posts", "statement_date": "2017-03-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
