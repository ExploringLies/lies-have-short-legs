Gov. David Dewhurst opposes the health care overhaul carried into law by Democrats this spring, but he agrees that something needs to be done because &quot;we spend more money on health care per capita in the United States than any other country in the world,&quot; Dewhurst said during an Aug. 25 meeting with the Austin American-Statesman editorial board. &quot;Of the 30 developed countries in the world,&quot; he said, &quot;we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average. Of the country that spends the second most per capita, Switzerland, we spend 175 percent more.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDewhurst didn&#39;t respond to our requests for back-up on his statement, which was similar to a remark he made to the Texas Tribune in May.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeeking authoritative international perspective, we turned to health statistics from the Organization for Economical Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group that represents <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/countrieslist/0,3351,en_33873108_33844430_1_1_1_1_1,00.html\">32 advanced, industrialized nations,</a> mostly in Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThough experts warned PolitiFact that there are <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/35/43618388.pdf\">variations from country to country</a> in how statistics are reported, the OECD&#39;s data is widely considered the most reliable way to compare the U.S. to its international peers on a variety of economic and social metrics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe found a table comparing total health costs per capita of 31 OECD countries, plus three more &mdash; Estonia, Israel, Slovenia &mdash; that were awaiting admission to the OECD at the time the data was released, on June 29. (Slovenia has since made the cut.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe OECD&#39;s most recent figures, for 2006-2008 (the year varies by country), shows the U.S. spent the most: $7,538 per person. Norway had the second highest cost per person, at $5,003, followed by Switzerland ($4,627). Turkey spent the least &mdash; $767 per capita. The only other countries where per capita health care expenditures exceeded $4,000 were Luxembourg and Canada.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis isn&#39;t a new No. 1 for the United States. We reviewed the OECD&#39;s statistics for the past two decades; the United States leads in spending each year. In 1990, we spent $2,810 per person, followed by Switzerland ($2,028) and Germany ($1,764). The OECD&#39;s data starts in 1960, when the United States was second in health care costs per capita at $148 to Switzerland&#39;s $166.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs of late, the average health care cost per capita of all OECD countries: $3,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Dewhurst is correct that we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average per capita. However, the statistics suggest, Switzerland doesn&#39;t spend the second most per capita &mdash; Norway does. Another departure from Dewhurst&#39;s statement: we only spend about 50 percent more than Norway and 63 percent more than Switzerland, not 175 percent more, as Dewhurst says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDewhurst was speaking off the cuff; perhaps he meant to say that we spend 175 percent of Switzerland&#39;s health care costs per capita, which translates into spending 75 percent more &mdash; much closer to the 63 percent figure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact.com in Washington covered similar ground in March when it rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/03/mitt-romney/romney-says-americans-pay-more-health-care-die-soo/\">True</a> former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney&#39;s statement that &quot;the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less&quot; on health care. &quot;To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner,&quot; Romney said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRecap: As far as we can tell &mdash; and keeping in mind that Dewhurst didn&#39;t respond to our queries for backup &mdash; he was spot-on in saying the United States spends more money on health care per capita than the rest of the world, and he&#39;s right that we spend two-and-a-half times more than the average cost of all the OECD countries. He erred in his Switzerland comparison.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate his statement as Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-30T17:15:55.940240", "ruling_date": "2010-08-31T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lt.
