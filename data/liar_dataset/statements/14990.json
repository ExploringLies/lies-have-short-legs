Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of readers asked us to take a closer look at his claim about Apple, so we did.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Apple&rsquo;s press release</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We can see where Trump got his number. Under the headline &quot;Apple accelerates US investment and job creation,&quot; &nbsp;Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-accelerates-us-investment-and-job-creation/\">announced on Jan. 17</a> a series of initiatives to bolster its position in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Combining new investments and Apple&rsquo;s current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers &mdash; an estimated $55 billion for 2018 &mdash; Apple&rsquo;s direct contribution to the U.S. economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years,&quot; the statement said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice that Apple did not say it plans to invest $350 billion. It described its &quot;direct contribution to the U.S. economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charles Lee, accounting professor at Stanford University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Business, told us the distinction is huge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Apple certainly did not just announce it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America,&quot; Lee said. &quot;This is a statement about its importance to the U.S. economy, not a statement about its new investments due to the tax law change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what did Apple&rsquo;s press release actually say?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said its purchases from other companies will be large -- about $55 billion in 2018. Lee said if that number didn&rsquo;t grow, Apple would spend about $275 billion over five years. But that&rsquo;s &quot;pre-planned,&quot; Lee said. It&rsquo;s the cost of doing business and doesn&rsquo;t represent new investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it isn&rsquo;t an investment in expansion, such as building new facilities, buildings and data centers, that brings the investment total down to $75 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even that figure is too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple wrote the $75 billion includes expected &quot;repatriation tax payments of approximately $38 billion.&quot; The new tax law offers a lower tax rate for companies that move profits off the books of their overseas subsidiaries and put them on their domestic balance sheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only is paying Uncle Sam not an investment, Lee cautioned that it doesn&rsquo;t even mean that Apple is doing anything with those overseas profits immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It simply means they are pre-paying the taxes on that cash right now to take advantage of the lower rates,&quot; Lee said. &quot;This ensures Apple will not need to pay any more taxes when, if ever, they decide to bring the cash back.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After subtracting the taxes, Lee said &quot;My best estimate of the change in Apple&#39;s U.S. investments attributable to the new laws is at most $37 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could be a few billion less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a section called &quot;Growing Apple&#39;s U.S. operations,&quot; the company wrote that it &quot;expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, it will add $4 billion to an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, an Apple program that helps finance American and foreign companies to expand in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That adds up to $34 billion over five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that Apple said it will invest $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump got the new hires figure right, but Apple&rsquo;s own announcement doesn&rsquo;t back him up on the investment dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After deducting the costs of paying suppliers and paying taxes, an accounting professor estimated the investment at no more than $37 billion. And based on the press release, it could be $34 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s still a lot of money, but it&rsquo;s less than 10 percent of what Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-31T15:48:25.618165", "ruling_date": "2018-01-31T15:46:22", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump inflates Apple investment", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-inflates-apple-investment", "ruling_link_text": "A smaller bite of the Apple", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-state-union-address/\">Remarks by President Trump in State of the Union Address</a>, Jan. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Apple, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-accelerates-us-investment-and-job-creation/\">Apple accelerates US investment and job creation</a>, Jan. 17, 2018</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Email interview, Charles M.
