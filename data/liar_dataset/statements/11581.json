And during a<a href=\"http://www.1140wrva.com/media/podcast-ask-the-governor-podcast-askthegovernor/julys-ask-the-governor-26213326/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>July 21</u></a> interview on WRVA radio in Richmond, McAuliffe added some details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I did announce a nice surplus the other day - $553 million,&quot; the governor said. &quot;I remind you, when I became governor I inherited a $2.4 billion deficit. It wasn&rsquo;t my budget, I wasn&rsquo;t even governor yet, and we worked in a bipartisan way to work that out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact-check McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim, wondering how he could have inherited a deficit from his predecessor, Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, when the state constitution requires a balanced budget. We examined the two elements in the governor&rsquo;s full statement: 1) &nbsp;that he inherited a deficit and, 2) that it was turned into a record surplus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The inheritance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virginia has a two-year budget cycle. Prior to the start of the first year, the legislature approves and the governor signs a biennial plan. After that, the governor and lawmakers negotiate budget amendments based on the needs and finances at the time. The state constitution<a href=\"http://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article10/section7\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>requires</u></a> that total expenditures not exceed revenues at the end of the two-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McDonnell, in one of his last acts as governor, presented two budget bills to the General Assembly on Dec. 16, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=141&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB29\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>first bill</u></a> put his finishing touches on the outgoing two-year budget, set to expire June 30, 2014. The proposal, called the &quot;caboose budget,&quot; anticipated $35.4 billion in general fund revenues for the budget cycle and $34.9 billion in expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=141&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB30\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>second bill</u></a> was McDonnell&rsquo;s proposal for the coming two-year budget, which began July 1, 2014. He anticipated almost $37.8 billion in general revenues and proposed $37.7 billion in spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, when McAuliffe took office on Jan. 11, 2014, McDonnell left two balanced budget bills sitting on his desk. So why does McAuliffe say he &quot;inherited a large deficit?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman, noted that the state&rsquo;s economy slowed that winter and spring, causing tax revenues to fall below expectation. The McDonnell administration &quot;left behind a budget that had a forecast that was too optimistic for our financial situation,&quot; he told us. &quot;They supported a spending threshold that was too high.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that mean McDonnell should have seen the economic slowdown coming? &quot;With the benefit of hindsight, some signs could have been detectable and some may have not,&quot; Coy said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slowdown was caused by two factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Tax cuts ushered in by former President George W. Bush expired in 2013 and the capital gains tax rose. As a result, there was a surge of people cashing in capital assets before the new rates took effect, followed by a lull after the levy went up. The lull caused a steep decline in non-withholding tax receipts in Virginia in 2014. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Federal spending cuts hurt Northern Virginia, the state&rsquo;s largest economic engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe sensed the problems shortly after taking office, but he underestimated their severity. On Feb. 12, 2014, he reduced the revenue estimate in the coming two-year budget McDonnell proposed by $140 million. &quot;Although our underlying economic forecast has not changed,&quot; McAuliffe<a href=\"http://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=3291\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>said</u></a>, &quot;it is clear that the current revenue receipts warrant attention.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May, the shortfall exploded to an estimated $1.5 billion. The General Assembly and McAuliffe that month agreed to a new two-year budget going into effect July 1 and patched the revenue hole by making about $800 million in spending cuts and drawing $700 million from the state&rsquo;s rainy day fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven months into his term, on Aug.15, 2014, McAuliffe<a href=\"https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=5800\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>estimated</u></a> the shortfall at $2.4 billion and ordered additional cuts to keep the new two-year budget balanced. In a<a href=\"https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=5800\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>speech</u></a> to the General Assembly&rsquo;s money committees, the governor said that out of caution, his forecast was deliberately &quot;pessimistic.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The surplus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement is that the shortfall was &quot;turned&quot; into the &quot;largest surplus in Virginia history.&quot; That stems from McAuliffe&rsquo;s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year that ended in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990. &nbsp;But it should be noted that when adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people hearing McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement might conclude that Virginia&rsquo;s budget has made almost a $3 billion rebound during the last year - from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus this year. That&rsquo;s not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe and the legislature overestimated the state&rsquo;s economic problems in August 2014 when they adjusted the two-year budget to a &quot;pessimistic&quot; forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe cites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe said, &quot;When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit. &hellip; We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple fact is that McAuliffe inherited balanced budget proposals from McDonnell. Perhaps, as the governor&rsquo;s spokesman suggests, McDonnell should have seen approaching clouds and proposed a more conservative spending plan. But that&rsquo;s hindsight and financial projections are tricky. When McAuliffe sensed an economic slowdown during his first weeks in office, he made a modest $140 million cut to McDonnell&rsquo;s revenue forecast. Six months later, McAuliffe was projecting a $2.4 billion shortfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe is hardly the first governor to accuse his predecessor of leaving behind a financial mess. But evidence shows the brunt of the economic slowdown, though not McAuliffe&rsquo;s fault, occurred during his watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year&rsquo;s $550 million surplus is a state record in terms of raw dollars, although not in inflation-adjusted dollars. But the surplus does not mean there&rsquo;s been a record turnaround in Virginia&rsquo;s economy. It means that the revenue shortfall is turning out not to be as steep as projected in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the whole, we rate McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-15T23:24:21.459508", "ruling_date": "2015-11-16T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "McAuliffe says he 'inherited large deficit' and turned it into a record surplus", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcauliffe-says-he-inherited-large-defict-and-turne", "ruling_link_text": "An embellished story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gov.
