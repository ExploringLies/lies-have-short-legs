So I&rsquo;m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious about Clinton&rsquo;s claim that Cleveland has it worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you stopped listening there, you might have thought she was saying the tap water in Ohio&rsquo;s second-largest city is also contaminated with lead &mdash;&nbsp;which is not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the debate, Clinton made a point of mentioning lead coming from other sources, too:&nbsp;&quot;I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it&#39;s not only in water systems, it&#39;s also in soil, and it&#39;s in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton campaign cited an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2016/02/cleveland_kids_poisoned_by_lea.html\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">article</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, and we found other reports and data that back her point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lead poisoning leads to serious <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs379/en/\">neurological and behavioral effects</a> ranging from shortened attention spans and developmental disabilities&nbsp;to coma and even death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3436211?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">no level</a> <a href=\"http://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-015-0008-9\">of lead</a> is safe in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm\">reference level</a> of 5 micrograms of lead per one deciliter of blood as an indicator of higher-than-usual blood lead levels. According to the CDC, 2.5 percent of American children age 5 and under &mdash; about a half million kids &mdash; test at this level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Residents of Flint have been consuming tap water with lead since 2014, when the city switched its water source to the polluted Flint River to save money. In 2015, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas had elevated blood lead levels, according to an <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/282806501/Pediatric-Lead-Exposure-Flint-Water-Results\">analysis</a> by Monica Hanna-Attisha, a researcher at Flint&rsquo;s Hurley Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has a point that many other American cities are dealing with the toxin.

In the county, 10.3 percent of kids had elevated blood levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cleveland and Cuyahoga County aren&rsquo;t exactly outliers.

(We should caution that the data is far from perfect; for example, 100 percent of kids in Colfax County, N.M., tested positive, but the sample size was just 33 kids.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, 15 counties had the same percentage or higher rates of poisoned children as Flint, but at double the reference blood-lead level:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYzlch20T8HK6uyH8OXoayu9W0o6vttoCxsZvCFs5Rw/pubchart?oid=756414849&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Flint, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas in Flint tested positive for lead poisoning in 2015.
