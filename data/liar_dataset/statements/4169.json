Gov. David Dewhurst says in his opening campaign video that his record shows he knows how to hold the line on spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington, he continues, is addicted to debt. In contrast, he adds, &quot;This past (legislative) session, we passed out of the Legislature a resolution requiring Congress to pass a balanced-budget amendment to the (U.S.) Constitution.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn online news search indicated that Dewhurst, who declared his candidacy July 19, was referring to <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&amp;Bill=HCR18\">House Concurrent Resolution 18</a>, which the House and Senate advanced in May. The House vote for the resolution was 115-17, the Senate vote 28-3.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe resolution doesn&rsquo;t require Congress to do anything. It <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/html/HC00018F.htm\">state</a>s, though, that given large annual federal deficits and the escalating national debt, and the failure of Congress to forward a balanced-budget constitutional amendment to the states, &quot;action must be taken to restore fiscal responsibility.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt goes on to say that a &quot;balanced-budget amendment would require the government not to spend more than it receives in revenues and compel lawmakers to carefully consider choices about spending and taxes; by encouraging spending control and discouraging deficit spending, a balanced-budget amendment will help put the nation on the path to lasting prosperity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe resolution closes by stating the Legislature &quot;respectfully urges&quot; Congress to &quot;propose and submit to the states for ratification&quot; a constitutional amendment providing that except during a war declared by Congress or other &quot;national emergency,&quot; total federal appropriations in a fiscal year may not exceed the year&rsquo;s estimated federal revenue. The next section calls for the resolution to be forwarded to Congress to be placed in the Congressional Record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor perspective, we contacted the resolution&rsquo;s author, Rep. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, who said that while no legislative resolution can make Congress do anything, &quot;political tides have been spread by much less than a resolution backed by a legislature that represents over 25 million people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCreighton said he thinks his resolution impresses on Congress that there&rsquo;s reason to bring up the amendment. &quot;In the aggregate, state by state by state, these legislatures sending these strong statements of political will&quot; have an effect, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCreighton said he&rsquo;s not troubled by Dewhurst saying the resolution requires Congress to approve the amendment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody&rsquo;s interpretation is that Congress has to act on it,&quot; Creighton said, adding that even a novice observer wouldn&rsquo;t conclude that a Texas-rooted resolution amounts to &quot;an iron-clad requirement&quot; that Congress act. &quot;It&rsquo;s kind of a gotcha that doesn&rsquo;t matter,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy the way, Congress cannot directly amend the Constitution. <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/house/Constitution/Constitution.html\">Article V</a> says an amendment can originate by two-thirds&rsquo; votes of the U.S. House and Senate, but still must be ratified by three-fourths of the states&rsquo; legislatures. Alternatively, the Constitution can be amended at a convention called by two-thirds of the states&rsquo; legislatures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn February, after the Texas Senate passed <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=82R&amp;Bill=SJR1\">a different version</a> of the call for a balanced-budget amendment, Dewhurst issued a statement characterizing the resolution as urging prompt action, noting that it takes ratification by three-fourths of the states for a constitutional amendment to stick.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign video leaves the misimpression Congress can, by itself, change the Constitution. It also misrepresents the Texas resolution by saying it &quot;requires&quot; Congress to affix the balanced-budget amendment. But the spirit of his message &mdash; that Texas legislators are aboard with the constitutional change &mdash; is accurate. We rate his statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-22T13:10:37.265563", "ruling_date": "2011-07-25T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "David Dewhurst says the 2011 Legislature required Congress to pass balanced-budget amendment to U.S. Constitution", "ruling_headline_slug": "david-dewhurst-says-2011-legislature-required-cong", "ruling_link_text": "Texas can't make Congress do diddly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tLt.
