You kept it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;We win a war, and we hand it over to some people we don&#39;t know and we leave.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And we lose the contracts to China,&quot; interjected one of the Fox anchors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yes, China will be another one,&quot; Trump agreed. &quot;By the way, Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya. What are we doing?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe thought Trump&rsquo;s statement about Libya and China was interesting, so we decided to look into it. We asked a Trump spokesman for comment, but we didn&#39;t hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency that collects data on energy. We&rsquo;ll take Trump&rsquo;s statement in two parts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&bull; <strong>Libya supplies the oil for China.</strong> Libya does supply <em>some </em>oil to China, but it&rsquo;s not as large as Trump&rsquo;s statement implies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe EIA <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/libya/pdf.pdf\">showed</a> that Libya&rsquo;s No. 1 customer is Italy, which bought 28 percent of Libya&rsquo;s exports in 2010. Italy was followed by France, at 15 percent, then China, at 11 percent. After that, Libya sold to Germany, 10 percent; Spain, 10 percent; Greece, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 4 percent, and United States, 3 percent. (More on that 3 percent in a bit.) Other countries combined to buy 14 percent of Libya&rsquo;s exports.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also wanted to know what share of China&#39;s imported oil comes from Libya. We <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/china/pdf.pdf\">found </a>that in 2009, China bought most of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia, which supplied 21 percent. That was followed by Angola, 16 percent; Iran, 11 percent; Russia, 8 percent; Sudan, 6 percent; Oman, 6 percent; Iraq, 3.5 percent; Kuwait, 3.5 percent and then Libya at 3.1 percent. Libya is followed by Kazakhstan at 2.9 percent and Venezuela at 2.6 percent. Other countries combined supplied 17.4 percent of China&rsquo;s imports.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo China is a big customer of Libyan oil, but not the biggest, and there are many other customers. And Libya is far from being China&rsquo;s chief supplier. It ranks ninth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;&bull; <strong>We get no oil from Libya.</strong> The United States doesn&rsquo;t get much oil from Libya.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, the U.S. imported 25.7 million barrels of oil from Libya, down from a recent high of 42.8 million barrels in 2007. The U.S. didn&rsquo;t import any oil from Libya between 1982 and 2004, due to an oil embargo first imposed by President Ronald Reagan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLibya is such a small source that it doesn&rsquo;t make it into the list of the <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html\">top 15 countries</a> from which the United States imports oil.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S companies are working to develop Libya&rsquo;s oil sector, however. In 2009, a deputy assistant secretary of state told Congress that U.S. companies are &quot;probably the most active and the most successful&quot; in helping Libya revitalize its oil sector.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They&#39;re seeking our technology because it&#39;s the best in the world and we&#39;re doing quite well,&quot; said the U.S. State Department&rsquo;s William Hudson. &quot;The Chinese are also active, but our companies have really taken the lion&#39;s share so far of bidding on plots for oil production.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrump said, &quot;Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya.&quot; His point in the first sentence was clearly that Libya was a major supplier of oil for China. But the data do not support his claim. Libya is far from being China&rsquo;s chief supplier. It ranks ninth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe second part of his statement is false -- the U.S. <em>does </em>get oil from Libya and the percentage is likely to increase..</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the whole, we rate Trump&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-11T15:41:59.451967", "ruling_date": "2011-04-11T17:12:09", "ruling_headline": "Libya sells most of its oil to Europe, not China", "ruling_headline_slug": "libya-sells-most-its-oil-europe-not-china", "ruling_link_text": "More to Europe than China", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFox News, interview with Donald Trump, April 4, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/china/pdf.pdf\">Country Analysis Briefs: China</a>, November 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/libya/pdf.pdf\">Country Analysis Briefs: Libya</a>, February 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrimly2&amp;f=m\">U.S. Imports from Libya of Crude Oil</a>, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_m.htm\">U.S. Imports by Country of Origin</a>, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBBC News, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3336423.stm\">Timeline, Libya sanctions</a>, Oct. 15, 2004</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tProf. Deborah Brautigam, <a href=\"http://www.chinaafricarealstory.com/2011/03/china-and-libya-whats-real-story.html\">China and Libya: What&#39;s the Real Story?</a>, March 4, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Prof. Deborah Brautigam, April 11, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFederal News Service, Hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, July 16, 2009, accessed via Nexis</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLos Angeles Times, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-china-oil-20110310,0,6747704.story\">Libyan strife exposes China&#39;s risks in global quest for oil</a>, March 9, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/world/africa/27migrants.html\">In Libyan Port, Stranded Migrants Watch Hope Depart</a>, Feb. 26, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Libya supplies the oil for China.
