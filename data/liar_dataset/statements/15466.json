Why? In part because &quot;<a href=\"https://billypenn.com/2018/05/17/the-eagles-will-reportedly-visit-the-white-house-in-june-whos-skipping/\">only a small number of players decided to come</a>,&quot; and in part because Trump said that players had been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1003832766511894528\">kneeling or standing in the locker room during the national anthem</a>, which he said was &quot;disrespectful.&quot;&nbsp;Many people on the internet made the reasonable assumption that Trump was talking about Eagles players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing:&nbsp;<em>none&nbsp;</em>of&nbsp;the Eagles&nbsp;kneeled during the national anthem in 2017. According to a study released by Sports Pundit, the Birds were one of just seven teams in the NFL with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sportspundit.com/football/articles/11437-kneeling-for-justice\">a perfect non-kneeling record</a>&nbsp;for the entire year. And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KNegandhiESPN/status/1003964953223663617\">they didn&rsquo;t wait in the locker room either</a>, per ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi.&nbsp;We found no reports that said players stayed in the locker room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only on-field activism displayed by some Eagles players was the raising of their fists during the national anthem, which was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/sports/football/malcolm-jenkins-eagles-super-bowl.html\">kickstarted by safety Malcolm Jenkins</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s one tiny exception: cornerback&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1003820649763262465\">Ron Brooks kneeled once</a>, but he was cut before the season started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movement among NFL players to kneel during the national anthem began back in 2016, when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/05/23/why-do-players-kneel-during-national-anthem\">San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick</a>&nbsp;took a knee during the 2016 preseason&nbsp;to protest police brutality and racial inequality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And other players followed suit.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/09/24/nfl-week-3-players-protest-kneeling-national-anthem-donald-trump\">A record number of players kneeled</a>&nbsp;during Week 3 of the 2017 season,&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;President Donald Trump stated that players who did so should be fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, NFL owners&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23582533/nfl-owners-approve-new-national-anthem-policy\">unanimously approved a new policy</a>&nbsp;that would require players to stand if they are on the field during the national anthem, and slap teams with a fine if they disobey. Under the new rule, players would still be able to wait in the locker room during the anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its reporting on Monday night, Fox News circulated images of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/06/05/fox-news-shows-eagles-kneeling-in-a-story-about-canceled-white-house-trip-they-were-praying/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.4fc28c2714c4\">a handful of Eagles kneeling</a>before games, implying they did so in protest. Players jumped to defend themselves, saying the photos of them kneeling were actually&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZERTZ_86/status/1003970728008519680\">moments of&nbsp;<em>prayer</em></a>, not protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Executive Producer Chris Wallace&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1004016985024421888\">later apologized</a>&nbsp;for the &quot;misleading&quot; footage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Eagles released their own statement &mdash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eagles/status/1003829058214514688\">basically a subtweet of the President</a>&nbsp;that didn&rsquo;t acknowledge the issues at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pennsylvania politicians have since jumped in on the action. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called Trump a &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/billy_penn/status/1003814602097025024\">fragile egomaniac</a>&nbsp;obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one will attend.&quot; Yeesh. So that&rsquo;s what happens when you insult Kenney&rsquo;s hometown team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senator Bob Casey said he still supports the Birds, and he invited players to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenBobCasey/status/1003782861844090880\">celebrate at the state Capitol</a>. U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepBrendanBoyle/status/1003781788068728832\">echoed that sentiment</a>, welcoming the team to Harrisburg for Wawa coffee (on him).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said&nbsp;he canceled the Eagles&rsquo; visit to the White House in part because some players declined to attend, and in part because &quot;staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But according to a study from Sports Pundit, there were zero Eagles players who kneeled during the national anthem during the 2017 season. And according to ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi, they didn&rsquo;t wait in the locker room either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-05T13:38:22.002283", "ruling_date": "2018-06-05T13:45:00", "ruling_headline": "President Trump said Eagles players kneeled for the anthem.
