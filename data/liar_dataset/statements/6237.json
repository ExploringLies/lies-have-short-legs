Phil Gingrey of Marietta joined the chorus the day the court released its decision to uphold the mandate during an interview on American Public Media&rsquo;s radio show &quot;Marketplace.&quot; It airs on WABE-FM, Atlanta&rsquo;s local National Public Radio station.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrey said he wouldn&rsquo;t care to have a beer with Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;d like to pour one on his head,&quot; Gingrey quipped. He also complained that the bill is a whopper of a tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This indeed is the largest tax [increase] in the history of our country,&quot; Gingrey said. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPoliticians and pundits have been using different versions of this talking point for years, and we&rsquo;ve often ruled it False or worse.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe latest such statement PolitiFact rated came from conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who earned a Pants on Fire for saying &quot;Obamacare is ... the largest tax increase in the history of the world.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s not even the largest in American history, PolitiFact ruled.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia contacted Gingrey&rsquo;s office for answers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we evaluate his response, let&rsquo;s review the reasoning behind our prior rulings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHold tight. It&rsquo;s complicated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants,<a href=\"http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=3672\"> broke down the tax impact of the health care law from 2010 to 2019.</a><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tOver the next 10 years, the plan would raise hundreds of billions of dollars through measures such as a Medicare payroll tax increase, new taxes on certain medical devices and so-called &quot;Cadillac&quot; health care plans, and an annual fee on health insurance providers. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health care law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenue coming in to the<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11439/WHCC_Presentation-4-12-10.pdf\"> government to be $525 billion between now and 2019</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs this the biggest tax increase in American history?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to a method employed by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury.<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/ota81.pdf\"> In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940 to 2006</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTempalski used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation. He measured the impact of the increase by calculating the increase in revenue as a percentage of the U.S.&rsquo; gross domestic product. He typically used estimates from immediately after the laws went into effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalculations for 1940-1967 should be viewed with some caution, he said, because revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tHere are Tempalski&rsquo;s top five tax increases from 1940 to 2006:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: 0.97 percent of GDP<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe 2010 health care law wasn&rsquo;t included in the list, so we calculated our own percent of GDP figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe chose 2019 as our base line. That&rsquo;s when the bill&rsquo;s tax provisions go into full effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO estimates that in 2019, the government<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11439/WHCC_Presentation-4-12-10.pdf\"> will see increased revenue of $104 billion</a>, including the penalty paid by people who decline to buy health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe divided that number into the<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/100xx/doc10014/AppendixA.7.2.shtml\"> CBO&rsquo;s gross domestic product projection for 2019</a>, which is $21.164 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe result: 0.49 percent of total GDP. The health care bill doesn&rsquo;t even crack Tempalski&rsquo;s top five.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber countered that the CBO&rsquo;s 2010 long-term budget outlook says Obama&rsquo;s health care law will increase revenue to 1.2 percent of GDP by 2035. That would catapult the tax to near the top of the list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that projection is for more than two decades from now. The accuracy of revenue and GDP projections plummet the further into the future they go.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, Gingrey&rsquo;s number is not comparable to those in Tempalski&rsquo;s ranking. Tempalski&rsquo;s calculation compares revenue estimates for years immediately after the new tax law goes into effect, not a generation out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, Gingrey cherry-picks favorable statistics while ignoring the most up-to-date information. The CBO&rsquo;s 2012 projections show Obama&rsquo;s health care bill will increase tax revenue by far less -- 0.8 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMake no mistake about it -- this is still a huge tax increase. And there are a lot of unknowns as the program is implemented.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Gingrey went further than that. He said it is the &quot;largest tax&quot; increase in the nation&rsquo;s history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact ruled previously that Obama&rsquo;s health care bill is not the largest tax increase in U.S. history. That ruling stands.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrey earns a False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-10T15:15:53.110643", "ruling_date": "2012-07-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gingrey claim about Obama health care old, inaccurate", "ruling_headline_slug": "gingrey-claim-about-obama-health-care-old-inaccura", "ruling_link_text": "Still not accurate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMarketplace, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/health-care/rep-phillip-gingrey-shocked-health-care-ruling\">Rep.
