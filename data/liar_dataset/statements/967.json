As keepers of the Flip-O-Meter, we feel obligated to document it.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Here&rsquo;s what happened: As word of AIG&rsquo;s bonuses filtered out, critics zeroed in on an amendment&nbsp;Congress passed in February that outlawed such bonuses but exempted contracts signed before Feb. 11, 2009.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n The amendment prohibited firms that had received federal bailout money from&nbsp;&quot;paying or accruing any bonus&quot; to the 25 most highly compensated employees as long as the company still owed the government money for the bailout.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n But somewhere in the legislative process, a line was added to say the amendment &quot;shall not be construed to prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n The extra line allowed AIG to hand out $165 million in bonuses for 2008 to executives of a division that lost piles of money that year.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Dodd had authored the original amendment. So CNN asked him on March 18 whether he was the one who added the Feb. 11 effective date.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;There is the suggestion today being made that you received more money from AIG than any other senator, and that you were responsible for the February 11th, 2009, date,&quot; CNN producer Ted Barrett said to Dodd on March 18. &quot;So, just &mdash; you know, again, I just want to get at ...&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;No,&quot; Dodd said.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;You're saying you had nothing to do with that date?&quot; Barrett pressed.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Dodd said.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n That was pretty clear. And yet a day later, with other sources telling CNN that Dodd was in fact the one who made the change, Dodd admitted as much.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;I agreed to a modification in the legislation, reluctantly,&quot; he told CNN's Dana Bash. &quot;I wasn't negotiating with myself here. I wasn't changing my own amendment. I was changing the amendment because others were insisting upon it.&quot;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;You were very adamant yesterday, very adamant that you didn't know how this change got in there,&quot; Bash said. &quot;And now you are saying that your staff did work with the administration?&quot;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;Going back and looking &mdash; obviously, I apologize,&quot; Dodd said.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Treasury officials later confirmed they had asked Dodd to change the amendment because they were afraid executives would sue if it was retroactive. In a\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhTn3n0EuTM&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdodd.senate.gov%2F&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">\n  press conference\n </a>\n , Dodd stressed that he was the one who authored the bonus restrictions in the first place, and that Treasury requested the change.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;I'm angry about it, and angry that in a sense I've been held up as sort of responsible for all this when in fact I responded to what I thought was a reasonable request at the time,&quot; Dodd said. &quot;I went through six weeks of a lot of criticism from the financial press, from Wall Street and others that my amendment was too restrictive, that it was unfair, that there would be a brain drain, that people would leave right and left.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Still, it was Dodd who chose to insert the loophole. For his 180-degree switch from steadfast denier to contrite confessor, the Flip-O-Meter registers a Full Flop.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:48.681598", "ruling_date": "2009-03-23T17:04:48", "ruling_headline": "Dodd flip-flopped on whether he changed amendment on bonuses to AIG and banks ", "ruling_headline_slug": "Dodd-flip-flop-AIG-bonuses", "ruling_link_text": "Dodd did a 180 on whether he wrote bonus loophole", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p align=\"left\">\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/nyregion/20dodd.html?scp=1&amp;sq=chris%20dodd%20a.i.g.&amp;st=cse\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Connecticut Senator Draws Voters&rsquo; Ire for His Bonus Role\n </a>\n , March 19, 2009, accessed March 22, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n CNN Newsroom,\n <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0903/18/cnr.01.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Fed to Announce Rate Decision; Summers Defends Handling of AIG; Congressional Loophole Investigated\n </a>\n , March 18, 2009, accessed March 22, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n CNN Live Event Special,\n <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0903/21/se.01.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  AIG: Facts and Fury\n </a>\n , March 21, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Washington with Marc Ambinder,\n <a href=\"http://politics.theatlantic.com/2009/03/dont_blame_chris_dodd_for_the_bonuses.php\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Don't Blame Chris Dodd For The Bonuses\n </a>\n , March 17, 2009, accessed March 22, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n PolitiFact.com,\n <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/20/national-republican-senatorial-committee/Dodd-failed-to-halt-bailout-bonuses/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Dodd failed to halt bailout bonuses, but he did limit future ones\n </a>\n , March 20, 2009, accessed March 22, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n YouTube.com,\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhTn3n0EuTM&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdodd.senate.gov%2F&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Dodd Sets the Record Straight About AIG\n </a>\n , March 20, 2009, accessed March 22, 2009\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Connecticut", "id": 3, "last_name": "Dodd", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "chris-dodd", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-chrisdodd.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.chrisdodd.com/"}, "statement": "<p>On whether he wrote a provision that allowed AIG to dole out bonuses.</p>", "statement_context": "a CNN interview.", "statement_date": "2009-03-19", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
