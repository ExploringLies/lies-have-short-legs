Also, there already are more cases worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/faq.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>SARS</u></a> is much more communicable than Ebola, meaning it is easier to catch. It can spread through a sneeze, cough, sharing a beverage or speaking up close with someone who has the disease. It is also possible that SARS travels through the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ebola</u></a>, on the other hand, is not airborne. Experts say it only possible to get Ebola by coming into direct contact with the body fluids of someone who is sick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sum, SARS spread to many more countries than Ebola has so far. However, there have been more cases of Ebola, and the death toll is much higher. The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/qa-mmwr-estimating-future-cases.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </u></a>anticipates that the number of cases in West Africa could reach the hundreds of thousands by January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Both are substantial public health outbreaks&quot; said Dr. David Weber, an expert in epidemiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. &quot;(It&rsquo;s) not really useful to try to determine which is worse.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the perspective of a United States citizen considering the two diseases&rsquo; impact here, Smiley&rsquo;s statement might have more weight, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. Many more cases of SARS made it to the United States than Ebola cases so far. (though there were no SARS deaths).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to remember that the largest focal point of the SARS outbreak (other than Hong Kong) was Toronto -- which brought the disease a little more close to home, Schaffner said. There were 251 SARS cases and 43 deaths in Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if the number of Ebola cases in the United States is low -- and lower than the number of SARS cases -- Smiley is incorrect because of the overall humanitarian impact of Ebola when compared to that of SARS, said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In terms of U.S. (Ebola) cases, it is still minimal,&quot; Markel said. &quot;If you&#39;re in West Africa, it&#39;s a nightmare and very serious, and far more deadly already than SARS was.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smiley said Ebola &quot;is not as bad as SARS was in 2003.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both diseases are serious and have harmed communities. SARS spread to more countries and is easier to transmit than Ebola. But Ebola has had more cases and higher death toll, and those numbers continue to rise. SARS may have had more of a presence in the United States, but Ebola is poised to be a larger humanitarian crisis globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Smiley&rsquo;s claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-19T10:08:05.527442", "ruling_date": "2014-10-19T17:58:17", "ruling_headline": "Was SARS worse than Ebola?
