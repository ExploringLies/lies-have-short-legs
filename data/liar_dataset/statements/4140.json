Gov. David Dewhurst criticized the economic stimulus program that President Barack Obama signed into law two years ago, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/dewhurst4texas/status/88257537987715072\">writing</a> July 5: &quot;What a nightmare! Obama&#39;s own economists say the stimulus cost $278K per job &#39;created.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDewhurst&rsquo;s tweet included a link to a <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-s-economists-stimulus-has-cost-278000-job_576014.html\">July 3 blog posting</a> on the conservative Weekly Standard&rsquo;s website headlined: &quot;Obama&#39;s Economists: &#39;Stimulus&#39; Has Cost $278,000 per Job.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEarlier the same day, the U.S. House speaker, John Boehner, R-Ohio, posted a similar claim linked to the Weekly Standard&#39;s blog. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a closer look.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Weekly Standard item cites a<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/cea_7th_arra_report.pdf\"> July 1 report</a> by the<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea\"> White House Council of Economic Advisers</a> stating that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act &quot;saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011.&quot; That report also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill&#39;s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe $278,000 per job figure doesn&#39;t appear in the report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the report&#39;s low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars-per-job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe blog item contends this statistic &quot;provides further evidence that President Obama&#39;s &#39;stimulus&#39; did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt,&quot; and insists that &quot;the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the &#39;stimulus&#39; and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokesman Jay Carney said its conclusions were &quot;based on partial information and simply false analysis.&quot; Carney noted that the stimulus was &quot;meant to do much more than just create and save jobs; it was also an investment in American infrastructure, education, and industries like clean energy &hellip; and investment in the economic future of America&#39;s working families.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe checked the White House report, and of the $666 billion stimulus total, 43 percent was spent on tax cuts for individuals and businesses; 19 percent went to state governments, primarily for education and Medicaid; and 13 percent paid for government benefits to individuals such as unemployment and food stamps.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe remainder, about 24 percent, was spent on projects such as infrastructure improvement, health information technology and research on renewable energy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn&rsquo;t just fund salaries &mdash; as the blog item implies. Lumping all stimulus costs together and classifying the total as salaries produces an inflated figure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFurthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report&#39;s low-end jobs estimate. Had it gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRepublicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by the 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A &quot;<a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010183560_apusfactcheckstimulusmath.html\">fact check</a>&quot; conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math &quot;satisfyingly simple but highly misleading.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers&rsquo; output &mdash; a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped from a factory floor, railroad tracks laid,&quot; the 2009 Associated Press item noted.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually &quot;has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs.&quot; It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs &mdash; or 288,000 more than it has now.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMoody&rsquo;s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s not that ARRA (the stimulus) is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA&#39;s help,&quot;<a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/07/republicans-falsely-claim-obama-advisers-burying-data-proving-stimulus-is-hurting-economy.php\"> Zandi told Talking Points Memo D</a>C. &quot;This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe day after the White House responded to the GOP&#39;s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a<a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/print/blogs/despite-white-protests-stimulus-still-cost-taxpayers-278000-job_576348.html\"> defense</a> that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but &quot;rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen again, this clarification doesn&#39;t fit with the blogger&#39;s earlier claim that taxpayers would have come out ahead if the government had just cut checks to everyone credited with getting a stimulus-tied job.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tContrary to Dewhurst&#39;s statement, the cited cost-per-job figure was not aired by the Obama administration. At bottom, his statement leaves the misimpression that the money went solely for jobs rather than a range of projects and programs, including tax breaks. We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em><strong>UPDATE, 4:45 p.m., July 20, 2011</strong>: After receiving feedback from a reader, we updated this item with further details about Recovery Act costs through March 2011.
