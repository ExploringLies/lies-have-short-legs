Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then speaker of the House, remarked on the historic nature of the bipartisan legislation, writing that its auto efficiency reforms were &quot;the first in more than 30 years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that law <a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/cafe/2017-Memorandum_05212010.pdf\">laid the groundwork </a>for Obama&rsquo;s rule changes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBush&rsquo;s administration left for Obama&rsquo;s the job of finalizing standards, something it hadn&rsquo;t yet done &quot;because of the uncertainty gripping car companies,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/26/us-obama-idUSTRE50P6MB20090126\">Reuters reported</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A lot of what Obama&#39;s doing is really extending what President Bush started,&quot; Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for Edmunds.com, told PolitiFact in January.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not what Obama&rsquo;s sweeping oversimplification suggested.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president also said that &quot;by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas.&quot; That&rsquo;s what the new rules require. <a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/faq-new-corporate-average-fuel-economy-standards.html\">Edmunds.com</a> reports that &quot;regulators, environmentalists and most automakers agree that existing technologies can be used to achieve this plan&#39;s goals.&quot; There&rsquo;s just debate about their cost. While automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won&#39;t carry companies through lofty goals set for 2025.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, <a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2012/Obama+Administration+Finalizes+Historic+54.5+mpg+Fuel+Efficiency+Standards\">13 automakers</a> in August announced support for the new standards, signaling they believe they&rsquo;ll be able to achieve the gains.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama said, &quot;After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas.&quot; The Obama administration launched new fuel efficiency standards that significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the rules, which raise standards from their 1985 levels, grew from a bipartisan law requested and signed by Bush. We&rsquo;ll give Obama credit for pushing for a long-term agreement with aggressive goals and working with automakers who say they&rsquo;ll get it done. But he&rsquo;s on shakier ground when he gives the impression his administration was solely responsible.
