And does it cost an &quot;extra $10 million&quot; for &quot;any construction project&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, DePetro said when we reached him, &quot;100 percent true.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told us that a &quot;PLA,&quot; a project labor agreement for the development of the 195 land, requires the use of union labor for construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just check with the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission, said DePetro, who also said that he would try to provide a copy of the PLA. &quot;I know that it&rsquo;s in existence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dyana Koelsch, spokeswoman for the commission, told us the commission is not aware of any requirement that obligates developers to use union labor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At DePetro&rsquo;s suggestion, we contacted Robert J. Boisselle, president of the Rhode Island chapter of Associated Builders &amp; Contractors, a nationwide association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The association represents 22,000 &quot;open shop&quot; construction companies that function without union labor. And like DePetro, Boisselle&rsquo;s organization believes that union contractors unnecessarily add to the cost of a construction project, by 12 percent to 18 &nbsp;percent. Boisselle also cited a 2011 research paper produced by the law firm Venable LLP, which looked at projects across the country, including the Big Dig in Boston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is union labor really required on the former Route 195 property?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DePetro is sure of it. Boisselle isn&rsquo;t sure: &quot;I have not seen a document or a piece of paper that has said any projects down on the 195 land will have a PLA, but I have heard that from many sources.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our next stop was Greg Mancini, executive director of BuildRI, which promotes unionized construction labor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mancini, who is a lawyer, told us there is &quot;no special legal requirement at the federal, state or local level that mandates&quot; the use of union labor on the former Route 195 land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing,&quot; he said, adding that it would be illegal for either the state or the commission to impose a requirement on developers&rsquo; privately owned construction sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, when asked to respond to Boisselle&rsquo;s comments on union labor costs, Mancini said he would not make a broad statement about the comparative cost of union labor. He said many developers have told his organization that unionized workers completed the job safely, on time and on budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also talked to Michael Sabitoni, president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, about DePetro&rsquo;s statement. &quot;He couldn&rsquo;t be more misinformed,&quot; Sabitoni said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we doubled back to DePetro, to let him know that the commission says there is nothing that forces developers to hire union labor on the former Route 195 land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DePetro dismissed the information from Koelsch, the commission spokeswoman, pointing to the way the &nbsp;hotel workers&rsquo; union has mustered opposition to a new hotel in the Fogarty Building, downtown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why? No labor agreement with hotel workers, so no hotel. In theory, one should be able to build a hotel in Providence, but in reality they cannot,&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I deal in real Rhode Island,&quot; he said in an email. &quot;You are buying the Chamber of Commerce BS.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his blog, DePetro wrote: &nbsp;&quot;Remember that developers are forced to use the &lsquo;195 land union&rsquo; contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DePetro was in Pants on Fire territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the state has entered into PLAs in the past. Construction unions are influential and the state can decide to only hire union-labor contractors for work on state land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The I-I95 commission, however, has no such requirement. Because of that, the business about $10 million in extra costs for &quot;any construction project,&quot; is irrelevant, in addition to being unsubstantiated&nbsp;in the original version of the blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So &quot;100 percent true&quot;? Not even close. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this ruling<strong>&nbsp;False.</strong></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-02T11:04:34.398891", "ruling_date": "2015-10-04T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "DePetro is dead wrong about unions and the 195 land  ", "ruling_headline_slug": "depetro-dead-wrong-about-unions-and-195-land", "ruling_link_text": "100% true, really?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.depetro.com\">DePetro.com</a>, &quot;The No Sox,&quot; accessed Sept. 23, 2015, later revised</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email, Dyana Koelsch, Sept. 23, 2015, and Sept. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email, John DePetro, WPRO, Sept. 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Greg Mancini, Sept. 23, 2015, and email Sept. 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decision of U.S. District Court in the case of Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Rhode Island versus City of Providence, 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City of Providence, Ordinance allowing for tax stabilization of property under authority of Route 195 Redevelopment District Commission, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email, Robert J.
