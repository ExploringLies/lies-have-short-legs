We must end the attacks on our police, and we must end them right now. We believe criminals who kill our police should get the death penalty. Bring it forth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s numbers are based on data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But factoring in the growing population of Americans and police shows the rate isn&rsquo;t as constant as Trump made it sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2016-statistics-for-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted-in-the-line-of-duty\">reported</a> that 57,180 officers were victims of line-of-duty assaults in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 525,600 minutes in a year, that breaks down to an assault every 9.19 minutes. Adjusting for the 10 percent of agencies that didn&rsquo;t report any data, that&rsquo;s an officer assaulted every 10.3 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the actions that legally count as an assault may not have resulted in pain inflicted on the officer, such as a drunk person shoving an officer. A shove carries the same weight as a stabbing by this measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 57,180 officers who were victims of assault, 28.9 percent (or 16,535 officers) sustained injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About three-quarters of the assaults did not involve a weapon other than hands, fists, or feet. Firearms were used in 4.2 percent of incidents and knives in 1.9 percent, according to the FBI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate of police deaths is much lower. In 2016, <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2016/officers-accidentally-killed/accidental_topic_page_-2016\">52</a> law enforcement officers died in accidents and <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2016/officers-feloniously-killed/felonious_topic_page_-2016\">66</a> were deliberately killed, according to the FBI. Those numbers have been decreasing over the past few decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump called out one kind of assault in particular during his speech:&nbsp;&quot;One of the most alarming crimes taking place against our police are ambush attacks. Think of that! Ambush attacks!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ambush attacks are rare, according to&nbsp;Safiya Jafari Simmons, communications director at the Center for Policing Equity. Ambush attacks were&nbsp;responsible for 270 of the 57,180 officer assaults. Most assaults resulted from officers intervening in disturbances, effectuating arrests, or transporting prisoners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s use of the rate of assaults per minute, known as the crime clock, isn&rsquo;t a sound practice, said James Fox, Lipman Family Professor of Criminology, Law, and Public Policy at Northeastern University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistic divides the number of minutes, not police officers, by attacks. But as the general and police populations grow, the clock still has the same number of minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Trump&rsquo;s statistic isn&rsquo;t an average of different regions but an aggregate of national assaults. The frequency of assault, then, would change depending on the area. A single city has fewer total police assaults than the country, but the clock has the same number of minutes; the frequency would be lower even in the cities with most assaults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dividing assaults by <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2016/officers-assaulted/tables/table-70.xls\">total police officers</a> is more telling, Fox said. By that measure, on average, an officer has a 9.8 percent chance of being assaulted per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said a police officer is assaulted every 10 minutes in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That math works out if you divide the number of minutes in a year by the FBI&rsquo;s count of line-of-duty assaults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few points to remember about this particular&nbsp;statistic. This count doesn&rsquo;t just isolate incidents where a wound was inflicted, such as a shooting and stabbing, so incidents such as shoving and kicking are also considered an assault. Also, a criminologist warned that the &quot;crime clock&quot; method does not really tell you that much, because it does not factor in the growing U.S. and police populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&#39;s statement is accurate but requires additional context. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-15T15:04:26.674653", "ruling_date": "2018-05-15T16:25:18", "ruling_headline": "Is a police officer assaulted every 10 minutes in the United States, as Donald Trump said?", "ruling_headline_slug": "police-officer-assaulted-every-10-minutes", "ruling_link_text": "Math checks out", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Youtube.com, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4418&amp;v=Clwv7l73to0\">President Trump&#39;s Remarks At National Peace Officers Memorial Service</a>, May 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steven Cheung, White House spokesman, May 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FBI.gov, <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2016-statistics-for-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted-in-the-line-of-duty\">Press release</a>, Oct. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UCR.FBI.gov, <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2016/home\">Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted</a>, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nleomf.org, <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/enforcement/\">Law Enforcement Facts</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with James Fox, Lipman Family Professor of Criminology, Law, and Public Policy at Northeastern University, May 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Adam Lankford, professor of criminology and criminal justice at The University of Alabama, May 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Safiya Jafari Simmons, communications director at the Center for Policing Equity,&nbsp;May 15, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In 2016, an officer was assaulted in America on an average of every 10 minutes.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2018-05-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Is a police officer assaulted every 10 minutes in the United States, as Donald Trump said?"}
