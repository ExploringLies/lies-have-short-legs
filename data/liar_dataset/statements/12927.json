Joaquin Castro questioned the decision while making a &quot;sewer&quot; claim about the group&rsquo;s director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Castro, D-San Antonio, said in an August 2016 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/763562013142478848\">tweet</a>: &quot;The group&#39;s director believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system. Is it really most qualified for the grant?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS, is mainly spread through sexual contact or from sharing needles, syringes, rinse water or other equipment with someone who has the virus, according to a <a href=\"https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/how-you-get-hiv-aids/\">federal website focused on AIDS</a>. Less commonly, per the site, the virus may be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, by being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle and, in rare cases, via blood transfusions and eating food pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spotted no mention of the virus getting conveyed from anything in a sewer pipe. &quot;HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces) and it cannot reproduce outside a human host,&quot; the site says. The virus also isn&rsquo;t spread by air or water, the site says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeking Castro&rsquo;s factual backup, we heard from his House spokeswoman, Erin Hatch, who emailed us web links to summer 2016 news stories--including an <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/16-million-texas-womens-health-care-grant-raises-q/nsDSz/\">story</a> posted earlier the day of Castro&rsquo;s tweet about Carol Everett, chief executive of the Round Rock-based <a href=\"http://heidigroup.org/\">Heidi Group</a>, which once ran no-charge crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth. Everett, the story said, &quot;recently came under scrutiny for suggesting during a fetal tissue disposal hearing that sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, could be transmitted through the sewer system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everett told the paper, though, that her highlighted comments had been misunderstood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everett also told reporter Julie Chang that her remarks about HIV&nbsp;amounted to &quot;a stupid mistake.&quot;&nbsp;Chang shared with us her notes from her interview with&nbsp;Everett, who said: &quot;I very much regret what I said. I shouldn&rsquo;t have even tried&hellip; because they misunderstood it. I didn&rsquo;t talk about transmitting STDs that way. I was trying to talk about the fact that babies are ground up and put into these garbage disposals which goes into our sewers. I didn&rsquo;t make that point very clearly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/texas-health-officials-propose-new-rules-on-fetal-/nrtFn/\">Existing regulations allow</a> fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill, or &quot;an approved alternate treatment process, provided that the process renders the item as unrecognizable, followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two instances</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our part, we confirmed from a TV news report noted by Hatch and Chang&rsquo;s recording of Everett&rsquo;s comments before a state agency that she indeed made mention of HIV and sewers while advocating for state officials to adopt a rule requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated rather than disposed other ways. <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/texreg/archive/July12016/Proposed%20Rules/25.HEALTH%20SERVICES.html#54\">The rule was proposed in June 2016</a> by the executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on behalf of the Department of State Health Services; it wasn&rsquo;t finalized as of Aug. 17, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chang&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGa1IybzVCRlNKb2c/view?usp=sharing\">recording</a> of Everett&rsquo;s comments at <a href=\"http://www.dshs.texas.gov/open/public-hearing-8-4-2016.aspx\">an Aug. 4, 2016 state hearing</a> on the proposed rule show Everett&nbsp;expressed criticism of current disposal methods, further saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:99pt\">&quot;What does this really do to the public? There are other people to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:99pt\">&quot;What if one of those sewer treatment programs breaks down one day? You know, the abortion industry doesn&rsquo;t have time; they only see a woman one time; they do not do an AIDS test, they don&rsquo;t do, they don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s HIV-positive. They don&rsquo;t know if she has a sexually transmitted disease. And what if one day, just one day, something horrible escaped into the sewer system?&quot; (Laughter.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:99pt\">&quot;It may sound funny but it&rsquo;s something we could think about because I can tell you today, the public is thinking about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:99pt\">&quot;So I appreciate very much addressing this. I encourage you to uphold it. Let&rsquo;s take care of those who cannot take care of themselves -- and I am talking about the women.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier, as pointed out by Hatch, Everett said in <a href=\"http://www.fox7austin.com/news/local-news/171342743-story\">an interview with Austin&rsquo;s Fox 7 aired July 7, 2016</a>, that existing protocols for disposing fetal remains pose &quot;several health concerns. What if the woman had HIV? What if she had a sexually transmitted disease? What if those germs went through and got into our water supply?&quot; Everett said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reached Everett about Castro&#39;s claim, she&nbsp;said by phone she hadn&rsquo;t explicitly said&nbsp;HIV is spread through sewer pipes--and doesn&rsquo;t believe as much. &quot;People with HIV and AIDS go to the bathroom every day,&quot; Everett said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the state hearing, she said, she was trying to stress that fetal material gets into the sewer system. Everett called her comment to Austin&rsquo;s Fox 7 about HIV/STD &quot;germs&quot; getting into &quot;our&quot; water supply &quot;really far out. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Castro said Everett &quot;believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everett didn&rsquo;t explicitly say as much and told us she doesn&rsquo;t believe it. However, on two occasions, she raised the &quot;what-if&quot; spectre of a woman somehow passing along the virus or an STD through fetal material flushed down a drain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.&nbsp;Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> more</a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/148168e6-0c97-4ec3-a073-4a6344d56ce6\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/148168e6-0c97-4ec3-a073-4a6344d56ce6</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-17T11:31:12.774785", "ruling_date": "2016-08-17T15:13:28", "ruling_headline": "Joaquin Castro says conservative activist believes HIV can be spread through sewer system", "ruling_headline_slug": "joaquin-castro-says-conservative-activist-believes", "ruling_link_text": "Public what-ifs", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/763562013142478848\">Tweet by U.S. Rep.
