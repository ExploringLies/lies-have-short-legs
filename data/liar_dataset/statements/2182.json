Rick Perry, who has called for President Barack Obama to dispatch more troops to the Texas-Mexico border, told a national TV audience last week that violence in Mexico has seeped into El Paso, across the Rio Grande from troubled Ciudad Juarez.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;You&rsquo;ve got bullets hitting the city hall in El Paso,&quot; Perry said in a July 28 interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Channel. &quot;You&rsquo;ve got bombs exploding in El Paso.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo days later, Perry spoke in a similar vein during a visit to Laredo. &quot;When a car bomb goes off in El Paso ... we know there&#39;s a (security) problem,&quot; said Perry, according to KGNS-TV, a Laredo station.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe threat of border spillover violence is a simmering topic. In June, for instance, PolitiFact Texas found Barely True U.S. Sen. John Cornyn&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/mar/27/john-cornyn/cornyn-says-spillover-violence-texas-real-and-esca/\">statement</a> that spillover violence was &quot;real and escalating.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut bullets and bombs in El Paso?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndeed, bullets fired on the Mexico side of the border struck El Paso City Hall on June 29. According to the El Paso Police Department, one bullet traveled through a ninth-floor window and an interior wall before lodging in a picture frame. Stucco walls of the government building were struck by an additional six rounds, the police said. Nobody in El Paso was hurt.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Investigators believe that the rounds may be related to (a shooting incident) that occurred in Juarez,&quot; a police department press release said. &quot;El Paso City Hall does not appear to be the specific target of these rounds.&quot; Darrel Petry, spokesman for the department, told us the Juarez incident involved an attack on Mexican federal agents.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked Petry if, as Perry says, bombs are exploding in El Paso. Petry replied: &quot;I am not aware of any bomb going off in El Paso.&quot; If that had happened, he said, &quot;I think I would have put the press release out.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger, responding to our request for information, said in an e-mail that violence in northern Mexico has continued to escalate &quot;and presents a clear and present threat to border communities.&quot; She noted that, in the interview with Van Susteren, Perry also mentioned the assassination of a Tamaulipas gubernatorial candidate this summer. Rodolfo Torre Cantu was shot and killed near the airport in that state&#39;s capital, Ciudad Victoria, about 200 miles from the Texas border city of Brownsville.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs for bombs, Perry &quot;also made reference to a car bomb that was detonated by cartel members a few weeks ago in Juarez just across from El Paso,&quot; Cesinger said. On July 15, a car bomb was set off in Ciudad Juarez&#39;s downtown, killing several people.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Associated Press quoted authorities saying the July 15 explosion was in retaliation for the arrest of a top leader of the La Linea gang, which works for the Juarez drug cartel. The bomb, which blew up a parked car, was described by the AP as bringing &quot;a new dimension of terror&quot; to the Mexican drug wars. The Washington Post reported: &quot;The assailants drew police and medical workers to the scene by leaving a bound, wounded man in a police uniform near an intersection and then calling in a false report that an officer had been shot.&quot; The Post and other news outlets said the bomb was then set off by a cell-phone signal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Juarez-based U.S. consulate&#39;s office closed July 30 &quot;to review its security posture,&quot; according to a message posted online by the office. &quot;American citizens are advised avoid the area around the Consulate General until it reopens.&quot; In March, a consulate employee and her husband were gunned down as they drove in their car about a block from the U.S.-Mexican border bridge on a major Juarez thoroughfare.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll in all, Perry&rsquo;s correct that bullets coming from across the border hit El Paso&rsquo;s seat of city government. No bombs have exploded in El Paso, however, though one went off in Juarez.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Perry&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-04T16:57:37.408000", "ruling_date": "2010-08-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rick Perry says  violence from Mexico reaching El Paso, with bullets flying and bombs exploding", "ruling_headline_slug": "perry-says-violence-mexico-reaching-el-paso-bullet", "ruling_link_text": "Bomb in Mexico, heard in El Paso?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Associated Press, news article, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas/car-bomb-in-mexican-drug-war-changes-ground-805509.html?cxtype=rss_texas\">&quot;Car bomb in Mexican drug war changes ground rules,&quot;</a> July 15, 2010 (accessed Aug. 2, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBloomberg News, news article, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-28/mexico-governor-candidate-torre-killed-in-tamaulipas-state-milenio-says.html\">&quot;Mexican Governor Candidate Assassinated in Tamaulipas as Drug Fight Rages,&quot;</a> June 28, 2010 (accessed Aug. 3, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConsulate General of the United States, <a href=\"http://ciudadjuarez.usconsulate.gov/july29warden.html\">&quot;Warden Message,&quot;</a> July 29, 2010 (accessed Aug. 2, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail,<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/08022010_responseperry.rtf  \"> response to PolitiFact Texas</a>, Katherine Cesinger, deputy press secretary, Gov.
