Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump administration in September began phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. That&rsquo;s the Obama-era program that protected from deportation immigrants in the country illegally who arrived when they were children, often called Dreamers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 5, a federal judge in Maryland said the Trump administration had the <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4403326/3-5-18-Casa-De-Maryland-Opinion.pdf\">authority to rescind DACA</a>. In a separate case, a federal judge in California in January ordered the administration to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1443/terminate-barack-obamas-immigration-executive-orde/\">resume accepting DACA renewal applications</a> and to keep the program on the same terms and conditions in effect, pending a final court judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question in this fact-check is &nbsp;have Democrats been on the sidelines, as Trump claimed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found Trump&rsquo;s tweet ignores Democratic and bipartisan efforts to find a solution. And it also downplays the president&rsquo;s own posturing that has impeded a deal.&nbsp;The White House did not provide an on-the-record response to our queries.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Efforts to advance legislation for Dreamers</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meetings with Trump</strong>: Trump and several lawmakers, including Democrats, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jan/09/what-happened-immigration-meeting-between-trump-bi/\">met Jan. 9</a> to discuss a permanent law to benefit Dreamers, funding for the border wall and additional changes to the country&rsquo;s legal immigration system. In the televised meeting, Trump expressed a willingness to work with Democrats and even to help the broader population of millions of immigrants in the country illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure?&quot; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Trump, since there is broad support for DACA but not for other immigration measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would like to do that. Go ahead. I think a lot of people would like to see that, but I think we have to do DACA first,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican lawmakers, however, rejected that idea, saying border security had to be part of the deal and not come at a later date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toward the end of the meeting, Trump said he&rsquo;d rely on the people at the meeting and approve their future proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have a lot of respect for the people on both sides. What I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I have great confidence in the people. If they come to me with things that I&#39;m not in love with, I&#39;m going to do it because I respect them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and other Republican lawmakers met again with Trump on <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jan/12/donald-trumps-s-hole-countries-remarks-and-its-pol/\">Jan. 11 to continue DACA talks</a>. But negotiations took a step back after reports that Trump used disparaging language to describe some countries. Durbin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenatorDurbin/status/951863329097703425\">told reporters</a> that Trump &quot;said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist.&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/953000902331453442?lang=en\">tweeted</a> that Durbin &quot;totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting&quot; and that &quot;Durbin blew DACA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Legislative attempts</strong>: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Feb. 28 sent a <a href=\"https://congressionalhispaniccaucus-lujangrisham.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chc-holds-trump-responsible-for-sabotaging-DACA-solution\">letter</a> to Trump listing several bipartisan bills they said Trump has rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have thwarted every bipartisan, narrow agreement that seeks to provide relief to Dreamers and instead have attempted to force a deeply unpopular, anti-immigrant agenda through Congress,&quot; the letter said. &quot;We cannot expect Congress to make any headway on protecting Dreamers until the White House and Republicans, who control every branch of government, choose to work with Democrats on a bipartisan DACA fix.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two Senate bills dealing with Dreamers failed to get 60 votes. Both proposals included Democratic support. One proposal was sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/2/senators-mccain-coons-to-introduce-bipartisan-immigration-compromise\">Sens.

The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-proposal/white-house-says-it-opposes-mccain-coons-bipartisan-immigration-bill-idUSKCN1FY2KZ\">opposed</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-warns-senate-against-advancing-immigration-proposals-that-dont-rescind-diversity-visa-lottery/article/2649175\">both</a> proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 11, a group of six senators &mdash; three Republicans and three Democrats &mdash; said they had reached a <a href=\"https://www.bennet.senate.gov/?p=release&amp;id=4139\">bipartisan agreement on immigration</a> that addressed border security, the diversity visa lottery, &quot;chain migration&quot; and Dreamers. Trump also opposed that deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards.

Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., <a href=\"http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/01/21/luis-gutierrez-border-wall/\">said</a> that while the border wall was &quot;a monumental waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money,&quot; he would be in favor of it if that&rsquo;s what it took to help Dreamers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Action or politics?</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>January government shutdown</strong>: In January, Senate Democrats demanded a solution for the Dreamers in exchange for their votes on a bill that would keep the government running. When the Senate took up a House measure that excluded a deal for Dreamers, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jan/22/timeline-daca-trump-administration-and-government-/\">many Democrats rejected it</a>. With a failed bill, the government on Jan. 20 entered its first shutdown since 2013. (Democrats received criticism for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/09/credo-action/did-democrats-vote-deport-dreamers/\">supporting a previous short-term spending bill in December</a> that did not address Dreamers.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the January shutdown loomed, Trump bashed Democrats for withholding votes because of DACA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA.
