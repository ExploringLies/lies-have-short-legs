The seat, held by Republican Erik Paulsen and challenged by Democrat Dean Phillips, has been widely considered a toss up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, a particularly incendiary claim has made its way into a TV ad created by the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&amp;v=m-OZUCuwqwQ\" target=\"_blank\">ad</a>, which aired on Sept. 15, criticizes Phillips for not offering health insurance to his coffee shop&rsquo;s employees. Phillips has made health care a focus of his campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same claim is mentioned in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=999LzHZZ0KE\" target=\"_blank\">Congressional Leadership Fund ad</a>, which aired only three days after the NRCC ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the text of the NRCC ad in full, before we break it down:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>&quot;Dean Phillips isn&rsquo;t telling you the whole truth.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>(Clip of Phillips&nbsp;speaking) &quot;We do offer health care to full-time employees.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>&quot;FACT CHECK. When a reporter asked if he offered health insurance, Phillips admitted &lsquo;No, we don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Dean Phillips is the 1 percent, but won&rsquo;t provide health care to all his employees. Dean Phillips: Another rich politician who can&rsquo;t tell the truth.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So does Phillips offer health insurance to his employees? He does, but not to all of them. But the ad distorts the facts and takes Phillips out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Phillips and his coffee company, Penny&#39;s</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Phillips opened <a href=\"http://www.pennyscoffee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Penny&rsquo;s Coffee</a> in downtown Minneapolis in 2016. The second location opened in August 2017 and a third is on the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRCC ad is accurate in that Phillips doesn&rsquo;t offer health insurance to all his employees, but it leaves out some important details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Penny&rsquo;s Coffee, like many companies, does not provide health insurance to part-time employees. It does, however, pay workers $15 per hour plus tips, Phillips&rsquo; campaign said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company now has full-time workers, and all of them get access to company-provided health care. When Phillips started the coffee shop, his campaign says he initially only had part-time workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But once the company grew, his campaign says, a handful of employees were converted to full time, and Penny&rsquo;s began to offer a health care plan in which it pays 50 percent of the premium.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What the ad cites</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRCC bases Phillips&rsquo; comments in a June 2017 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robbmandelbaum/2017/06/25/entrepreneur-running-for-congress-health-care-should-be-a-moral-right/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#7157c82568ff\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes Magazine article</a> in which he declared health care &quot;a moral right.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was asked this question in the article: &quot;Does the coffee shop you&rsquo;ve started offer health insurance?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His full answer: &quot;No, we don&#39;t. We are contemplating a pretty significant expansion, which would necessitate a reinvestigation of that, but right now, we&#39;re just a single coffee shop with a handful of employees, and that&#39;s something we&#39;ll assess moving forward. But the ACA afforded opportunities to employees like ours to actually go out and obtain health insurance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRCC ad cuts him off after &quot;No, we don&rsquo;t,&quot; removing the additional context.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee says that Phillips doesn&rsquo;t provide health insurance to his coffee shop employees even after he has said that health insurance should be a &quot;moral right.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that he doesn&rsquo;t provide coverage for his part-time employees, but does so for his full-time employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"9cdde337-03f9-4b9d-9a07-987076e2654b\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ClaimReview\"> <div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">2018-10-08 14:29:53 UTC</div> <div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"> <div itemprop=\"name\"><a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">PolitiFact</a></div> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://dhpikd1t89arn.cloudfront.net/logos/politifact_logo.png\" alt=\"PolitiFact\" /> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\">3</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"worstRating\">1</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"bestRating\">7</div> <img style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://dhpikd1t89arn.cloudfront.net/rating_images/politifact/tom-mostlyfalse.jpg\" alt=\"PolitiFact rating logo\" /> PolitiFact Rating: <div style=\"font-weight: bold\" itemprop=\"alternateName\">Mostly False</div> </div> <div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\" itemprop=\"claimReviewed\">Says that Minnesota Democratic congressional candidate Dean Phillips doesn\u2019t offer health insurance for his employees.</div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\"> <div itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"> <div itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div itemprop=\"name\">National Republican Congressional Committee</div> <div itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Super PAC</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"sameAs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-OZUCuwqwQ</div> </div> <img style=\"display:none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Logo_NRC_Elephant.jpg\" /> <div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\" itemprop=\"name\"></div> <div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Saturday, September 15, 2018</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">2018-09-15</div> </div> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/08/national-republican-congressional-committee/attack-ad-falsely-claims-dean-phillips-doesnt-prov/\" itemprop=\"url\">Read More</a> <div style=\"float: right\"> <a href=\"#\">info</a> </div> </div> </div> </div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-06T11:35:05.865326", "ruling_date": "2018-10-08T10:14:41", "ruling_headline": "Attack ad falsely claims that Dean Phillips doesn't provide health coverage to his employees", "ruling_headline_slug": "attack-ad-falsely-claims-dean-phillips-doesnt-prov", "ruling_link_text": "He offers health care to all full-time employees", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NRCC <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&amp;v=m-OZUCuwqwQ\">Ad</a>, Sept. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CLF <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=999LzHZZ0KE\">Ad</a>, Sept. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robbmandelbaum/2017/06/25/entrepreneur-running-for-congress-health-care-should-be-a-moral-right/#7157c82568ff\">&quot;Entrepreneur Running For Congress: &#39;Health Care Should Be A Moral Right,&#39;&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WCCO CBS Minnesota, &quot;<a href=\"https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/09/12/rc-paulsen-phillips-ad-war/\">Reality Check: The 3rd District&rsquo;s Ugly Campaign Ad War</a>,&quot; Sept. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Star Tribune &quot;<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/republicans-attack-dean-phillips-business-background-in-new-tv-ads-as-he-competes-for-rep-erik-paulsen-s-seat/492550121/\">Republicans attack Dean Phillips&#39; business background in new TV ads as he competes for Rep.
