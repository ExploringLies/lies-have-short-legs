Chiang said in a Facebook live video on August 13, 2017, joined by Congressman Ted Lieu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/9400014/Chiang%20FB%20live%201.JPG\" style=\"height:619px;

One type can cover more than half the cost of developing a unit while the other can cover a quarter of the cost, Schwartz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schwartz clarified that these tax credits are only used on affordable rental properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treasurer&rsquo;s data seems like a fair starting point for tracking affordable housing construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But given that some of the construction was for rehabilitation -- something Chiang did not make clear in his statement -- we wanted a deeper look at the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How many rehabs?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found rehab projects accounted for more than half of the construction in 2014 and more than 60 percent of construction in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most of the rehabilitations are of existing affordable housing units. That&rsquo;s different than actually adding brand new units to the housing stock. That quote (from Chiang) is not spliced in a way that that&rsquo;s obvious,&quot; said Carol Galante, a professor of affordable housing at UC Berkeley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A treasurer&rsquo;s office <a href=\"http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/factsheet.pdf\">fact sheet</a> promotes the same 80 percent increase in affordable housing units, but clarifies that those are &quot;built or rehabilitated.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/9399965/treasurer%20fact%20sheet.JPG\" style=\"height:422px; width:507px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/factsheet.pdf\">California Treasurer&#39;s Office</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not just a coat of paint</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives for the treasurer told us they&rsquo;ve always interpreted the term &quot;building, construction&quot; as including both new and rehabilitated units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Stivers, who heads the state tax credit allocation committee, said rehabs involve far more than &quot;just slapping paint&quot; on an old apartment. The use of the federal tax credit for rehabilitation, he said, locks in that unit at an affordable rate for 55 years through a deed restriction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schwartz, of the nonprofit housing partnership, added that rehabilitation is a key part of preserving California&rsquo;s limited affordable housing stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that Chiang has shown strong leadership in expanding affordable housing in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>California State Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed he&rsquo;s helped boost &quot;the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent&quot; since he took office in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from the treasurer&rsquo;s office show an 83 percent increase in the construction -- and rehabilitation -- of affordable housing units from 2014 through 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Chiang&rsquo;s claim omits the fact that less than half were <em>new units</em> added to the housing supply. The majority were rehabilitation projects on existing homes.
