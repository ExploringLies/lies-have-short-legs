But he knows we have the right to vote, doesn&rsquo;t he?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn presenting his bill, which is co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., Pocan said he wanted to make it more difficult for states to impose rules on voting, such as having to present a photo identification in order to cast a ballot. We won&rsquo;t take up here what impact their proposed amendment might have.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut Pocan gave us pause when he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPa5CEwVafs\">said</a> on the House floor:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe right to vote &quot;is so fundamental that most Americans, understandably, assume it is already enshrined in the Constitution&quot; -- but &quot;most Americans would be wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;While the right to vote is inherent throughout our founding document, and there are amendments prohibiting discrimination, nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote. We, as Americans, possess no affirmative right to vote.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWords matter, and Pocan&rsquo;s claim -- that &quot;nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote&quot; -- is precisely worded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tStill, is he right?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Pocan&#39;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhen we asked Pocan for evidence to back his statement, he told us to go read the Constitution.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tJust kidding.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut we did wonder how he would try to prove that something doesn&#39;t exist.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe existence of the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/15thamendment.html\">15th</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/document.html?doc=13&amp;title.raw=19th%20Amendment%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Constitution:%20Women%27s%20Right%20to%20Vote\">19th</a> and <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=323\">26th</a> amendments, which prohibit discrimination based on race, gender and age, implies there is no explicit right to vote in the Constitution, Pocan spokesman Samuel Lau told us.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHe also cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em><a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html\">Bush v. Gore</a></em>, which effectively <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/%7Eachaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Bush_v._Gore.html\">resolved</a> the razor-thin 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote,&quot; the high court observed, according to Lau.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut that was only the first part of the quote -- the rest is: &quot;for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn other words, the Supreme Court declared that the Constitution contains no right to vote for president, <a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/alex-keyssar\">Alexander Keyssar</a>, professor of history and social policy at Harvard University, told us.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s OK as far as it goes; let&rsquo;s go further.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Other evidence</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA number of other authorities who back an amendment like the one Pocan proposes have cited the lack of the guarantee he cites:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t-- Keyssar, author of <em>The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States</em>, told us: &quot;The basic fact is there is no affirmative right to vote in the U.S. Constitution.

That always comes as a surprise to non-lawyers.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t-- In 2006, University of Baltimore law professor Garrett Epps, critical of photo ID requirements, made almost the same statement Pocan did, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2006/09/21/no_right_to_vote/\">saying</a>: &quot;The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly guarantee a right to vote.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut what do other constitutional scholars say?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tJudith Best, distinguished teaching professor of political science at State University of New York-Cortland, told us the key phrase in Pocan&rsquo;s claim is &quot;explicitly guarantees.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;It seems clear to me that the obvious intent&quot; of the Constitution, she said, &quot;is that the people are to choose their governments -- their representatives.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSimilarly, <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/people/roger-pilon\">Roger Pilon</a> at the libertarian Cato Institute -- who doubts Pocan&rsquo;s amendment would have much impact, if adopted -- told us that amendments to the Constitution make it clear there is a right to vote.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s so implicit as to be all but explicit,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut intending or implying aren&rsquo;t quite the same as an explicit guarantee. And in Pocan&#39;s opinion, an explicit guarantee would make it more difficult to put restrictions on voting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll leave the final word to scholar <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/v/hans-von-spakovsky\">Hans von Spakovsky</a> of the conservative Heritage Foundation and author of <em>Who&rsquo;s Counting?: How Fraudsters and Bureaucrats Put Your Vote at Risk</em>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;It is correct that there is not an explicit provision in the Constitution guaranteeing the right to vote,&quot; he said, &quot;but several amendments guarantee the right to vote at age 18, free of racial discrimination, and protected by the Equal Protection doctrine.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAcknowledging that the right to vote is inherent in the Constitution, Pocan nevertheless called for amending the document and declared: &quot;Nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhether adding such a guarantee would have much impact is debatable. But Pocan&rsquo;s narrowly constructed claim is accurately stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe rate it True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-29T16:09:54.217306", "ruling_date": "2013-05-30T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Constitution is not explicit on the right to vote, Wisconsin Rep.
