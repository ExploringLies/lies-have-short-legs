The medical examiner determined that Lorich&rsquo;s death was a suicide, a fact that&nbsp;the New York Police Department confirmed for us again on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But another website, Intellihub, published <a href=\"https://www.intellihub.com/surgeon-who-exposed-clinton-foundation-corruption-in-haiti-found-dead-in-apartment-with-stab-wound-to-the-chest/\">a Dec. 12, 2017 story</a> suggesting something more nefarious&mdash;that Lorich was murdered after exposing corruption involving the Clinton Foundation in Haiti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.) It appears to be making the social media rounds nearly a year after publication, with CrowdTangle data showing it has &nbsp;been shared on Facebook nearly 80,000 times, generating almost 373,000 social media interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A well-known surgeon who exposed major inadequacies in medical trauma care promised to the Haitian people by the Clinton Foundation after the nonprofit raised over $30 million dollars in donations following the devastating 2010 earthquake was found dead in his upscale apartment Sunday with a stab wound to the chest,&quot; begins the Intellihub.com story written by Shepard Ambellas and labeled as an &quot;opinion&quot; piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intellihub&rsquo;s website describes Ambellas as &quot;an opinion journalist, analyst, and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News &amp; Politics.&quot; Ambellas is also, according to the site, a regular contributor to <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/alex-jones/\">Alex Jones&rsquo; InfoWars.com</a>, a website known to traffic in fake news and conspiracy theories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambellas goes on in the story to report that Lorich was working with a team of doctors in Haiti when he &quot;discovered an almost non-existent medical effort backed by the Clinton Foundation.&quot; When he was stateside again, the story says, Lorich aired his grievances in an email that was eventually forwarded to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A note at the end of the article asks readers who they think murdered the doctor. &quot;Did the doctor&rsquo;s persistence wind up getting him added to the Clinton body count?&quot; the website says. &quot;Please comment and share.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Intellihub&rsquo;s website, it is an &quot;independent news outlet which covers a variety of topics such as politics, the economy, surveillance, liberal corporate media bias, and much more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambellas did not immediately respond to an email seeking more information about the article. An email sent to an address at the bottom of the Intellihub website also went unanswered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story links to three outside sources. The first is a New York Post <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/12/11/surgeon-found-dead-in-home-was-sued-by-ex-giant-for-ending-his-career/\">article</a> about the surgeon&rsquo;s death and the lawsuit he was facing. It doesn&rsquo;t mention the Clintons or Haiti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second is a WikiLeaks <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3852\">page</a> that appears to show an email Lorich wrote in 2010 that was eventually forwarded to Hillary Clinton. By the time it reached the the-secretary of state, the subject line was: &quot;DOCTORS REPORT FROM HAITI.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Depressing,&quot; wrote the aide who forwarded it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the email, Lorich describes a trip to Haiti with other doctors to provide trauma care in the wake of a devastating earthquake there. When they arrived, they were discouraged to discover that &quot;disaster management on the ground was nonexistent,&quot; according to the email. &quot;The difficulties in getting in despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and David Helfet&rsquo;s high political connections with Partner&rsquo;s in Health as well as the Clintons only portended the difficulties we would have once we arrived.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email does not mention the Clintons nor the Clinton Foundation again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third link is the CNN <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/25/doctors.haiti.hardships/index.html\">piece</a> authored by Lorich and surgeons Soumitra Eachempati and David Helfet. &quot;Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful,&quot; the headline reads. They describe their plan to help safely amputate the limbs of injured earthquake victims with a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We thought our plan was a good one, but we soon learned we were incredibly naive,&quot; the CNN opinion piece says. &quot;Disaster management in Haiti was nonexistent. The difficulties getting in&mdash;despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet&rsquo;s connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton&mdash;only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lorich and the surgeons wrote of numerous points of failure in the operation before finally taking aim at the United States, writing, &quot;The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no further elaboration of the involvement of the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/13/did-the-clinton-foundation-raise-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-a-hospital-in-haiti-that-was-never-built/?utm_term=.6181061ebee1\">other fact-checkers have noted</a>, the Clintons played a role in Haiti recovery efforts. Hillary Clinton led the U.S. government&rsquo;s response to the disaster, Bill Clinton was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti and their foundation raised millions for relief projects. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-clintons-haiti-development-plans-succeed--and-disappoint/2015/03/20/0ebae25e-cbe9-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html?utm_term=.cbbbc316366a\">The couple faced allegations</a> that their efforts didn&rsquo;t accomplish enough and that some of the projects they backed benefited foreign investors and the wealthy more than poor Haitians. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lorich&rsquo;s criticism was aimed at the United States, not the Clinton Foundation, but conspiracy theories that the Clintons kill their political enemies <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/clinton-body-bags/\">aren&rsquo;t new</a>. And Intellihub isn&rsquo;t alone in promoting the idea that the doctor&rsquo;s death was retribution. But while these stories lean on some factual information&mdash;Lorich traveled to Haiti and he was discovered with a chest wound&mdash;there is no evidence that suggests he was murdered by the Clinton family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-22T10:02:21.856625", "ruling_date": "2018-10-22T10:32:43", "ruling_headline": "No, a doctor was not murdered after criticizing the Clinton Foundation", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-doctor-was-not-murdered-after-criticizing-clint", "ruling_link_text": "No, a doctor was not murdered after criticizing the Clinton Foundation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Statement from the New York Police Department, Oct. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=187504848\">Obituary</a>, Dean Lorich, The New York Times, Dec. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/12/11/surgeon-found-dead-in-home-was-sued-by-ex-giant-for-ending-his-career/\">&quot;Surgeon found dead in home was sued by ex-Giant for &lsquo;ending his career&rsquo;,&quot;</a> New York Post, Dec. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, <a href=\"https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AMNEWS&amp;docref=news/168C0C08245FD420&amp;f=basic\">&quot;His Giant burden - Doc faces ex-players suite before killing self,&quot;</a> New York Daily News, Dec. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/doctor-found-dead-knife-torso-nyc-apartment-article-1.3689775\">&quot;Doctor found dead with knife in chest in Manhattan apartment while home alone with 11-year-old daughter,&quot;</a> New York Daily News, Dec. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News clip, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/york-surgeon-found-dead-park-avenue-apartment/story?id=51710242\">&quot;Acclaimed NY surgeon found dead in Park Avenue apartment in suspected suicide,&quot;</a> ABC News, Dec. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/york-surgeon-found-dead-park-avenue-apartment/story?id=51710242\">&quot;Surgeon who exposed Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti found dead in apartment with stab wound to the chest,&quot;</a> Intellihub, Dec. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/12/11/surgeon-found-dead-in-home-was-sued-by-ex-giant-for-ending-his-career/\">&quot;Surgeon found dead in home was sued by ex-Giant for &lsquo;ending his career,&rsquo;&quot;</a> New York Post, Dec. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3852\">Emails</a> from Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s Email Archive, Wikileaks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Op-ed, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/25/doctors.haiti.hardships/index.html\">&quot;Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful,&quot;</a> CNN, Jan. 25, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/13/did-the-clinton-foundation-raise-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-a-hospital-in-haiti-that-was-never-built/?utm_term=.ff4d7a73426e\">&quot;Did the Clinton Foundation raise &lsquo;hundreds of millions of dollars&rsquo;
