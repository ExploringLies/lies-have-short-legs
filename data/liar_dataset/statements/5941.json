Brown dialed up the criticism Monday prior to a Mandel event near a GM plant in Lordstown.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA headline on a news release labeled Mandel as &quot;anti-auto rescue.&quot; In the release, Friends of Sherrod Brown spokeswoman Sadie Weiner said Mandel &quot;would have voted &lsquo;no&rsquo; on the auto rescue despite the fact that it saved Ohio jobs and put middle-class families back to work.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim caught PolitiFact Ohio&rsquo;s attention, given Mandel&rsquo;s trademark stealth. Had we missed a policy stand?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter considerable research and many discussions with both campaigns, we are not convinced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown has been painting his opponent as anti-auto bailout since at least March, when Mandel told The Vindicator, Youngstown&rsquo;s daily newspaper, that he was developing a plan &quot;to rescue the auto industry.&quot; To those who thought the industry already had been rescued by the government loans to Chrysler and GM, Mandel&rsquo;s statement was a head-scratcher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m not saying the bailout didn&rsquo;t work,&quot; Mandel told the paper. But he also said he &quot;respectfully disagreed&quot; that it saved the U.S. auto industry. Nowhere in the story is he quoted as saying he would have voted against the loans as a senator.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNevertheless, Mandel&rsquo;s opponents pounced. Citing The Vindicator story in late March, the Ohio Democratic Party bashed Mandel in a news release that, among other gripes, stated he &quot;would have voted to let the auto industry die.&quot; The state party works closely with Brown&rsquo;s campaign -- so closely that Justin Barasky, the Brown campaign&rsquo;s communications director and a former party spokesman responded to our questions about the statement at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarasky referred PolitiFact Ohio to a Toledo Free Press article from March 14 that appeared under the headline &quot;County Democrats criticize Mandel for opposing auto bailout.&quot; Barasky also pointed us to a statement from U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, a South Carolina conservative who cited Mandel&rsquo;s support of a &quot;ban on government bailouts&quot; when endorsing him in June 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in the weeks that followed our initial questions, we found no evidence that Mandel himself had ever confirmed he would have voted against the auto bailout. Meanwhile, both the Brown campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party continued with this line of attack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel could have made it easy on us by simply taking a position -- yea or nay. But true to form, he declined. Furthermore, his campaign communications director, Travis Considine, was adamant that our research was accurate: Mandel had not taken a public stance on the loans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe followed up with both campaigns last week and again this week as Mandel traveled to the heart of Ohio&rsquo;s car-manufacturing belt. Barasky emailed us a clip of video footage he said comes from a February meeting with the Tea Party Express near Cincinnati.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Your United States senator, Sherrod Brown, voted for the Wall Street bank bailout, the largest bailout of Wall Street banks in the history of the United States of America,&quot; Mandel says from behind a podium in the video. &quot;If I were there, I would have voted against it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s where it gets tricky. The Wall Street bailout is encapsulated by the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a measure Congress passed in October 2008. After the Senate failed to reach a deal on a separate bailout for automakers, President George W. Bush, nearing the end of his administration, allocated TARP funds to Chrysler and GM.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident Barack Obama allocated additional TARP funds to the two companies in 2009. It is important to note, though, that the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, never held an up-or-down vote on a standalone auto bailout.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown&rsquo;s official support for the rescue plan came when he cast a procedural vote to quickly move on a bill that would have given the automakers emergency loans. The motion failed. Brown also voted for TARP, but at the time no TARP money had been reserved for Chrysler or GM.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarasky argues that Mandel has the benefit of hindsight, and that by declaring he would have voted against the bank bailout, he also is declaring he would have voted against the auto bailout.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Mandel was in Lordstown this week, a reporter for the Youngstown Business Journal asked about this very conflict. Did Mandel oppose the allocation of TARP funds to the automakers?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel did not answer the question directly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When I talk to Democrats, Republicans and independents throughout the Mahoning Valley, I have not come across anyone who supports bailing out Wall Street banks,&quot; he said. &quot;I agree with Democrats, Republicans and independents in the Mahoning Valley that it&rsquo;s dead wrong to bail out the Wall Street banks with our tax dollars.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does all of this put the Brown campaign&rsquo;s statement on the Truth-O-Meter?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senator&rsquo;s re-election team said Mandel &quot;would have voted &lsquo;no&rsquo; on the auto rescue.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel doesn&rsquo;t help himself by refusing to take a clear position. A voter who read his comments in The Vindicator would be hard-pressed to determine where he stands on the auto bailout. He indicated he did not think the measure was perfect, but he stopped short of speaking against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut PolitiFact Ohio puts the burden of proof on the speaker. And the Brown campaign was unable to show us anything in which Mandel definitively stated he would have voted against rescuing the auto industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy virtue of voting against TARP, a position Mandel confirms he would have taken, he would have voted against a bill that eventually benefited the auto industry. Of course in these hypotheticals, Mandel wouldn&rsquo;t have known that at the time, so it is intellectually dishonest to write him off as anti-auto rescue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMaybe Mandel will enlighten voters one day with his thoughts on the loans to Chrysler and GM. But for the moment, Brown&rsquo;s campaign is putting words in Mandel&rsquo;s mouth and pushing a deceiving line of attack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-17T19:30:32.965006", "ruling_date": "2012-05-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sherrod Brown campaign says Josh Mandel opposes the auto industry rescue", "ruling_headline_slug": "sherrod-brown-campaign-says-josh-mandel-opposes-au", "ruling_link_text": "Nay to bank bailouts, but on auto bailouts, ???", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFriends of Sherrod Brown news release, &quot;Awkward: Anti-Rescue Josh Mandel Campaigns in the Valley Today Just Minutes Away from Lordstown Chevy Cruze Plant,&quot; via email, May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Justin Barasky, Brown campaign communications director, May 9-16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Travis Considine, Mandel campaign communications director, May 9-16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe (Youngstown) Vindicator, <a href=\"http://www.vindy.com/news/2012/mar/02/mandel-developing-rescue-plan/\">&quot;Mandel developing rescue plan,&quot;</a> March 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Democratic Party news release, &quot;<a href=\"http://ohiodems.org/news/3-reasons-josh-mandel-will-continue-repeating-misleading-ridiculous-pants-on-fire-falsehoods/\">3 Reasons Josh Mandel Will Continue Repeating &lsquo;Misleading,&rsquo; &lsquo;Ridiculous,&rsquo; &lsquo;Pants on Fire&rsquo; Falsehoods</a>,&quot; March 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails from Barasky, March 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Free Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.toledofreepress.com/2012/03/14/county-democrats-criticize-mandel-about-auto-industry/\">County Democrats criticize Mandel for opposing auto bailout</a>,&quot; March 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSen.
