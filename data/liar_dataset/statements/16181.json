Approval of the application was contingent on an applicant paying assessed taxes, application fees and a $1,000 penalty.

As a result of its passage, 2.7 million people obtained permanent residency status, according to a <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/lessons-immigration-reform-and-control-act-1986\">report</a> from the Migration Policy Institute.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;(Senate bill 744) was also closely tied to meeting border security benchmarks, whereas the &nbsp;Immigration Reform and Control Act legalization had no strings attached,&quot; Alden said in an email.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Unlike the bill McCaskill voted for five years ago, Alden said the Reagan-era law did not &quot;prevent people from coming illegally in the future or from working in the United States even if they didn&rsquo;t have status.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;To conflate this with the amnesty President Reagan signed is a misreading of what (the 2013 bill) contained,&quot; Alden said.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>As for the Senate Leadership Fund&rsquo;s claim that 11 million people would have benefitted from the bill&rsquo;s pathway to citizenship, experts agreed that&rsquo;s also a stretch.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;Not everyone would have been able to meet those requirements and pay those fees (to get citizenship),&quot; said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Voigt said the lengthy process combined with strict background check requirements would have prevented all from qualifying.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In 2013, McCaskill voted for a bill that would have given undocumented immigrants living in the country a path, albeit a long one, to citizenship. The Senate Leadership Fund&rsquo;s claim that she joined &quot;the liberals&quot; in supporting a bill that would have given &quot;amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants&quot; is deceptive for three reasons:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>First, the bill was branded as a bipartisan solution to immigration reform and co-sponsored by four Republican and four Democratic senators.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Second, the bill included numerous hurdles unauthorized immigrants would have had to overcome, including fines and background checks, before becoming eligible for full citizenship. Experts say it is a loose interpretation of blanket residency.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Lastly, in 2013 there were approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, but given the exclusions and restrictions included in the 2013 bill, not all of them would have qualified to start the citizenship process under the Senate bill&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>For those reasons we rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-04T11:16:32.694105", "ruling_date": "2018-11-04T11:20:44", "ruling_headline": "McCaskill voted for path to citizenship, but it's a stretch to call it amnesty", "ruling_headline_slug": "mccaskill-voted-path-citizenship-its-stretch-call-", "ruling_link_text": "Definition of 'amnesty' in question", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Cooper, Betsy and Kevin O&rsquo;Neil.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/lessons-immigration-reform-and-control-act-1986\">&quot;Lessons from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.&quot;</a>&nbsp;Policy brief.
