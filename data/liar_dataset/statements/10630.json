Scott Walker&rsquo;s 2015-&rsquo;17 budget proposal, a number of ideas have popped up about how to generate revenue for Wisconsin state parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among them: Beer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, sort of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a March 3, 2015, meeting of the Legislature&rsquo;s Joint Finance Committee, state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, suggested to Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp that there was a way to capitalize on all the visitors from Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin already charges higher state parks admission fees for visitors from other states. Annual stickers cost $25 for Badgers and $35 for others; a night camping at Devil&rsquo;s Lake, our most-visited park, is $15 for Wisconsin residents and $17 for outsiders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marklein said fees could be raised, and the flatlanders -- er, Illinois residents -- would keep on coming to Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They love coming up,&quot; Marklein said. &quot;They can drink beer in our parks. They can&#39;t there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsinites have a long-standing love-hate relationship with visitors from Illinois. For many in the hospitality business, Illinois visitors are a vital source of revenue. Others fret that they overwhelm Wisconsin with big city driving habits and attitudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But aside from the all that, we wondered if Marklein is right. You can pop a brewski at Devil&rsquo;s Lake State Park, or other parks in Wisconsin, but you can&rsquo;t do that in the Land of Lincoln?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we followed up with Marklein, aide Crystal Potts said the senator was basing his comments on <a href=\"http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/parks/AlcoholBan.htm\">a list posted in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list, under the tab &quot;alcohol restrictions,&quot; lists 53 state parks and recreation areas -- from Apple River Canyon State Park to Wolf Creek State Park. The page says violators face a misdemeanor that carries a fine of $75 to up to $1,500 and one to six months in jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s pretty steep for a Bud Light by the campfire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wisconsin, other than <a href=\"http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/rules/alcohol.html\">a handful of exceptions,</a> drinking is allowed in state parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are a couple problems with Marklein&rsquo;s list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, for many of the parks the list notes restrictions only at certain areas within a park, not the entire park. What&rsquo;s more, there are <a href=\"http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/PARKS/region.htm\">many state parks in Illinois</a> that are not on the list at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Illinois DNR confirmed that there is not a universal alcohol ban in that state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Out of the 130 parks, there are 77 (where) alcohol is allowed,&quot; said an email from the Illinois DNR. &quot;It is only banned in the parks that are listed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we&rsquo;ve got plenty of reasons for visitors to escape to Wisconsin and -- with budget troubles -- perhaps even a new reason to charge them more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the pleasure of a cold beer on a hot summer night isn&rsquo;t among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marklein wants to boost state parks&rsquo; charges for out of state residents, and -- noting how many people from Illinois come to Wisconsin -- he claimed visitors can&rsquo;t drink in state parks in Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you can drink in &nbsp;more than half of the parks in that state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Marklein&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-18T15:14:46.618877", "ruling_date": "2015-03-20T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Howard Marklein says beer drinking is not allowed in Illinois state parks", "ruling_headline_slug": "howard-marklein-says-beer-drinking-not-allowed-ill", "ruling_link_text": "Actually less than half", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=9614\">Cathy Stepp appearance before Wisconsin State Legislature&rsquo;s Joint Finance Committee, March 3, 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails, Crystal Potts, office of Sen.
