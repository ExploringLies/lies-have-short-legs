The post first appeared on or around April 24, 2017, on States-TV.com, <a href=\"http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us/\">HoustonChronicle-TV.com</a> and <a href=\"http://fox-news24.com/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us/\">Fox-News24.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged it as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to clear fake news from users&rsquo; news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post is keyed to a real event: Russia&rsquo;s Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/20/524906703/top-russian-court-bans-jehovah-s-witnesses-under-anti-extremism-law\">banned the religious organization</a> on April 20, <a href=\"http://tass.com/world/942396\">labeling the group as a danger</a> for &quot;extremist activities.&quot; The assets of the St. Petersburg headquarters and almost 400 chapters were designated state property. Its literature and website have also been banned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, the story devolved into fairytale, claiming Trump warned that the move &quot;is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russian Federation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you,&quot; Trump is quoted. He also is credited as saying Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness could find freedom in this country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As this is an infringement of your fundamental human right, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated,&quot; he said, according to the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is, there is no record Trump said any of these things. Aside from a few examples of this same post being on multiple websites, we couldn&rsquo;t find any official record of him personally addressing the subject at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to a White House spokesman to confirm this but didn&rsquo;t receive a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Department spokesman Mark Toner did <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-04-21/state-department-condemns-russian-clampdown-on-jehovahs-witnesses\">release a statement on April 20</a> saying that the United States was &quot;extremely concerned by the Russian government&#39;s actions targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toner also noted that religious freedom was critical to society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All religious minorities should be able to enjoy freedom of religion and assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Russian Federation&#39;s constitution,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s no mention of Trump making any statement, and we couldn&rsquo;t find one elsewhere. Reposts have circulated of the country&rsquo;s 175,000 Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/jehovahs-witnesses-russia-ban-police-589791\">being harassed by Russian police</a> since the ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox-News24.com is a url that attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network. The same goes for HoustonChronicle-TV.com, which mimics the real newspaper&rsquo;s name but doesn&rsquo;t look to have affiliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three of the sites are filled with the same kind of sponsored content ads endemic to fake news sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even though this story appears to be bogus, it&rsquo;s difficult to fully determine the point of the websites, because they do contain some legitimate news articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox-News24.com, for example, features <a href=\"http://fox-news24.com/devos-id-be-fine-ditching-the-education-department/\">one article about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos</a> saying she wouldn&rsquo;t mind shutting down the Education Department. It&rsquo;s copied practically word-for-word from <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-02-17/betsy-devos-id-be-fine-if-we-could-ditch-the-education-department\">a Feb. 17 story</a> from <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox-News24.com administrators have <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/fox-news24.com\">hidden the registration</a> of the website, which&nbsp;was only registered on March 20.

The same goes for the other <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/states-tv.com\">two websites</a> <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/houstonchronicle-tv.com\">we&rsquo;ve noted</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said that Trump warned Russia for banning Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, and offered a safe haven for Russians who wanted to come to America. The State Department did decry Russia&rsquo;s ruling, but there&rsquo;s no evidence Trump weighed in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-27T15:34:02.241503", "ruling_date": "2017-04-28T11:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Reports that Trump offered asylum to Russian Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses use fake quotes", "ruling_headline_slug": "reports-trump-offered-asylum-russian-jehovahs-witn", "ruling_link_text": "No record of Trump saying these things", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>States-TV.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://states-tv.com/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us/\">Trump warns Russia over Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.</a>,&quot; April 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HoustonChronicle-TV.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://houstonchronicle-tv.com/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us/\">Trump warns Russia over Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.</a>,&quot; April 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox-News24.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://fox-news24.com/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us/\">Trump warns Russia over Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.</a>,&quot; April 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox-News24.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://fox-news24.com/devos-id-be-fine-ditching-the-education-department/\">DeVos: I&#39;d Be Fine Ditching the Education Department</a>,&quot; Feb. 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2017-02-17/betsy-devos-id-be-fine-if-we-could-ditch-the-education-department\">DeVos: I&#39;d Be Fine Ditching the Education Department</a>,&quot; Feb. 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tass.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://tass.com/world/942396\">Russia&rsquo;s Supreme Court bans Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses as extremist organization</a>,&quot; April 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/20/524906703/top-russian-court-bans-jehovah-s-witnesses-under-anti-extremism-law\">Top Russian Court Bans Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, Claiming &#39;Extremist Activities&#39;</a>,&quot; April 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-04-21/state-department-condemns-russian-clampdown-on-jehovahs-witnesses\">State Dept.
