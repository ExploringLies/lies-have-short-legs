So PolitiFact Oregon hit the road to check Duyck&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted county spokesman Stephen Roberts, who pointed us to documents that seem to support the assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last budget adopted before Duyck became board chairman in 2011, for instance, contained $6 million less for bicycle and pedestrian improvements than is budgeted in the current fiscal-year cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of that, $3 million comes from Gain Share, a state program that compensates local governments for providing tax breaks to qualifying companies. &quot;This represents new dedicated bike/ped funding that did not exist before,&quot; Roberts wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An additional $2.7 million for bike/ped projects this year is coming from a special district formed years ago to resurface hundreds of miles of streets in the county&rsquo;s urban, unincorporated area. If incorporated, it would would be one of the largest cities in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2011, the Board of Commissioners approved Duyck&rsquo;s suggestion to modify the program to allow funding of &quot;safety improvements,&quot; including sidewalks. Twelve of 13 projects funded this year have been pedestrian improvements, according to county budget documents. &quot;This also represents new funding available for bike/ped improvements,&quot; Roberts wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final chunk of &quot;new&quot; money comes from the county&rsquo;s Minor Betterments program, an allocation of the county&rsquo;s road fund. The $500,000 available this year for bike/ped projects compares with $320,000 budgeted the year before Duyck became chairman, according to documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, those numbers show significantly more money is spent now for bike/ped improvements than before Duyck became chairman. But can he fairly say that money is &quot;more than at any time in the history of Washington County&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say that with authority, Roberts said, because a decade or more ago, total road project costs were the only figures recorded. Bike/ped work done as part of those projects was not broken out, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But the county has only gotten bigger,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;And in all typical projects we take on now, we estimate that 25 percent is bike/ped. Based on the numbers, it seems like an accurate statement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For additional historical reference, we reviewed county spending on these projects going back to the boom years of 2004-05. That year&rsquo;s combined total of the top two sources for bike/ped money was the second-highest ever. Even so, the total still fell about $5 million short of this year&rsquo;s record-breaking amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we called Commissioner Dick Schouten, an outspoken advocate of bike-friendly policies who shows up to most meetings on his bike. Of Duyck&rsquo;s claim, he said, &quot;I guess that&rsquo;s true in the sense we have some new programs and access to additional dollars we didn&rsquo;t have before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He quibbled only with Duyck&rsquo;s use of the phrase &quot;under my watch.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not sure what that means, &lsquo;under my watch,&rsquo;&quot; Schouten said. &quot;He&rsquo;s one vote among five.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, unlike in Multnomah County, the Washington County chair does not prepare the annual budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington County board Chairman Andy Duyck, now running for re-election, claims that more money has been spent for bicycle and pedestrian improvements during his first term as chairman than at any time in Washington County history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budget documents show that spending for such projects is now more than $6 million more than it was before Duyck became chairman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparable figures from more than a decade ago aren&rsquo;t available because statistics specific to bike/ped projects weren&rsquo;t listed separately then. However, spending on bike/ped projects during the building-boom years of 2004-05 was $5 million less than current allotments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fellow commissioner noted that Duyck didn&rsquo;t approve the spending allocations alone since it takes at least three votes for a budget proposal to win. We also note that while Duyck voted for the increases, his &quot;watch&quot; doesn&rsquo;t come with the power to write the proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-04T19:12:47.436448", "ruling_date": "2014-04-04T16:12:38", "ruling_headline": "Has Washington County spent more on bike/ped projects under Andy Duyck's watch than in county history?", "ruling_headline_slug": "has-washington-county-spent-more-bikeped-projects-", "ruling_link_text": "Walking and pedaling to a street near you", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange, Stephen Roberts, Washington County communications coordinator, March 26, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Stephen Roberts, April 4, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Andy Duyck, Washington County commissioner, April 2, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Dick Schouten, Washington County commissioner, April 2, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington County Transportation Department Fiscal Year 2013-14 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington County Transportation Department Fiscal Year 2004-05 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington County Charter.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Chairman, Washington County Board of Commissioners ", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Andy", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 2730, "last_name": "Duyck", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "andy-duyck", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Duyck_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2730/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.co.washington.or.us/BOC/Commissioners/Andy-Duyck.cfm"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve dedicated more money from (Washington County&rsquo;s) transportation budget to bike and ped projects under my watch than at any time in the history of Washington County.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a public presentation", "statement_date": "2014-04-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
