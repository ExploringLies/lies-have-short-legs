Chris Christie became governor were just awful, with previous administrations raising property taxes by startling amounts, he suggested during Tuesday&rsquo;s budget address to the Legislature.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn describing the way things used to be done in New Jersey, Christie asked lawmakers and the public to recall the state&rsquo;s dire financial straits as recently as four years ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years,&quot; Christie said, according to the text of his speech.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie has made this claim before, first in October at a town hall meeting in West Milford.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven that New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, the 70 percent jump in a decade might not seem so shocking. But we learned a couple of things: first, the increase was actually slightly higher than 70 percent, but it falls once property tax rebates are factored into the mix.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie spokesman Michael Drewniak told PolitiFact New Jersey at the time that the 70 percent jump in taxes in the decade before the governor took office resulted from &quot;unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s look at the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat increase amounts to more than 71 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow let&rsquo;s look at the issue of rebates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn previous fact-checks, experts have explained that reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they&rsquo;re intended to reduce property tax costs for homeowners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman, the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy 2009, the average rebate was $1,037.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen those rebates are deducted from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office comes in under 70 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebate was deducted from property tax bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said during his budget address that &quot;property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years&quot; to him becoming governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking at the numbers, the average property tax bill in the 10 years before Christie took office climbed more than 70 percent, from about $4,240 to about $7,280.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the increase drops to more like 50 percent when property tax rebates are factored into the equation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, the overall point here is that property taxes jumped significantly in the decade before he became governor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/02/politifact_nj_chris_christie_s_12.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-27T16:54:29.376869", "ruling_date": "2013-02-28T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie repeats claim about 70 percent hike in New Jersey property taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-repeats-claim-about-70-percent-hike", "ruling_link_text": "Depends on use of tax rebates", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, Chris Christie says property taxes jumped 70 percent in decade before he took office as governor, Oct. 22, 2012, accessed Feb. 27, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGovernor Chris Christie&#39;s Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Address As Prepared for Delivery, Feb. 26, 2013, accessed Feb. 26 and 27, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Governor of New Jersey", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 27, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1251, "last_name": "Christie", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "chris-christie", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/christie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1251/", "total_count": 105, "true_count": 21, "website": "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a budget speech to the state Legislature", "statement_date": "2013-02-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
