Pathetic,&quot; Trump tweeted July 27, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the Democrats caved and added flags after he and others noticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, there is some evidence to the fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A false flag?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people noticed the flag missing during the first day of the convention on July 25, 2016. The conservative <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/25/no-visible-american-flags-present-at-the-democrat-convention/\">Daily Caller</a> wrote &quot;No Visible American Flags Present At The Democrat Convention.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Daily Caller is at the Democratic National Convention Monday and it doesn&rsquo;t look like there are any American flags. The stage is bland and grey, with no red, white or blue present. A thorough look at the crowd present also turns up no American flags,&quot; the website wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some went further, saying the flag actually was banned at the DNC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rYEx2-YJouNJEd5KKY0NSW-_jsjontuhfQ-Jhq__4FLG9TYWIFnJEBE-8sZMgKgTmhMHDZlpA4Bofd8dLAJnB8kNdYyT01KHogB58oeZQnL2Kw1CMicboe6pcs6kcAgNnhbAedn7\" style=\"border:none; height:625px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That particular viral image is bogus, there is no ban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about Trump&rsquo;s more-tempered claim that there was &quot;not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Capture the flag</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re here at the DNC and have seen American flags at the Wells Fargo Center. The issue -- to the extent that Trump and others are making it an issue -- surrounds the stage that Democrats built in Philadelphia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stage includes huge video boards that serve as the main visual element for delegates in the arena and viewers on TV back at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our editors, Amy Hollyfield, snapped this photo before the convention opened July 25, 2016. It shows the set-up we described &hellip; and sizable virtual American flags on the video board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qO9ACZgq_ss-UB34NbCv0E0gXuggZd3eFZjAT_fCqMtJozHArHbsh0J08nbQjr9gm9xpO7ep7E_wJyDAZ2_4oXzXNp9YnVDICx0UUaYervZRrrdQZ_E95flHHhIEe6z-Za2A6uoD\" style=\"border:none; height:399px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard to miss the flag there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where Trump and some people may have a point is that there did not appear to be physical flags on the stage during the first night of the convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A physical flag did appear during the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem. You can see it, if you don&rsquo;t believe us, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ePB39acAtA\">31 minutes into this video of the convention&rsquo;s proceedings</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when the color guard left, so did the physical flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flags appear!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also has a point that flags were added to the stage, starting with the second day of the convention July 26, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just one, and they weren&rsquo;t necessarily small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a pre-flag photo from Bernie Sanders&rsquo; speech on the first night of the convention, taken by Stephen Crowley of the <em>New York Times.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m57UFbd0DWxN1VlrM1oyElTlWO0SUYNFyJWW2rmKgniFsW0IyhpE_DBSVXM6_fp0-izoKEnbLFEyk54fFNJjFySehBT0zuTpKqVm0QeKL5e9sVeCzRLpPFUvDmU7upfBO6SSpInW\" style=\"border:none; height:409px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And here&rsquo;s a photo from Ruth Fremson of the<em> New York Times</em> from the next night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6POJ_QrVZk5DaGgxcHUQdc5elozLqp2sLNtXRp7yIWVucm8zbCBcawBbPVJD5jSoUNzYGyIhkMWobazz6UCZ8_Q9Y5XdIfEdPpiY6yuH_PXGUyAcHz28r8FtMTEA2nYwae8GVw7V\" style=\"border:none; height:360px; width:442px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be hard to see, but the DNC did add a series of flags along the edge of the stage. You can see them in the shadows in the righthand side of the photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a better view. This photo was taken by Stephen Crowley, also of the<em> New York Times</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/g2hYzP-yKYAi_DelYulbI5IBAmVvPL18DlAReDIYOntoZZQFIY8ttEVBjqnjH0kuMA7qY0i8AakdB6nCda5pPFlsCVbRIznrH5-N16B0RCmM8GN-UXX7PzTb8lmIwABdWtfHYRzp\" style=\"border:none; height:413px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda why flags were added to the stage Tuesday (and why they weren&rsquo;t there Monday). If we hear back, we&rsquo;ll let you know. We also reached out to the Trump campaign but did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said on Twitter, &quot;Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge video board prominently displayed the American flag during the first day. The proof is in the photos. And a physical flag made an appearance during the National Anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump has a point that physical flags (plural) appear to have been added to the stage for the second day of the Democratic National Convention, after some stories reported the lack of flags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is partially accurate. We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Update: After we published, and thanks to a reader, we came across photos from the day before the convention, July 24, that showed flags on the wings of the stage.
