The article noted the timing of the trip was also due to the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Obama&rsquo;s trip to New Zealand was already confirmed in late February, long before McCabe&rsquo;s firing. Obama visited the country to meet with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/politics/obama-new-zealand-nose-rubbing-greeting/index.html\">discuss topics</a> such as climate change and social media&rsquo;s impact on politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article also claimed that Obama left a &quot;trail of proof&quot; through the presidential daily briefings inside the White House proving that he plotted with Russia to obstruct Trump amid the presidential decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hero of the article is depicted as U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, who compiled a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/01/what-is-in-the-fbi-nunes-memo-382314\">memo</a> that accused top FBI officials of alleged wrongdoing. It&nbsp;concluded that Nunes was the one who found that Obama&rsquo;s presidential daily briefings included illegal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)&nbsp;activity and &quot;spy games&quot; targeting Trump. We found no evidence that Nunes has ever made such allegations against Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2017, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106\">tweeted</a> that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign, an accusation that the heads of both the NSA and the FBI denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What actually happened is that the FBI and the Department of Justice put together an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/fisa-court-explainer-trnd/index.html\">application</a> to the FISA court that approves surveillance warrants pertaining to national security and foreign intelligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama himself, however, would have no role in authorizing or requesting wiretaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hoax website claimed that Obama fled the country due to new evidence that he was involved with spying on Trump and responsible for colluding with Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Obama&rsquo;s trip abroad to New Zealand was to speak about issues with the prime minister, and he was not involved with ordering any wiretaps to spy on Trump during the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-04T16:00:30.585615", "ruling_date": "2018-04-05T10:15:58", "ruling_headline": "No, Barack Obama did not flee the country because of criminal activity ", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-barack-obama-did-not-flee-country-because-surfa", "ruling_link_text": "Bogus story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Viral Truth Wire, <a href=\"https://www.viraltruthwire.com/obama-secretly-flees-us-leaves-stunning-evidence-behind/\">Obama secretly flees US - leaves stunning evidence behind</a>, March 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/23/politics/obama-new-zealand-nose-rubbing-greeting/index.html\">Barack Obama gets a traditional nose-rubbing welcome in New Zealand,</a> March 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/01/what-is-in-the-fbi-nunes-memo-382314\">The Nunes FBI memo: What you need to know</a>, February 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106\">twitter</a>, March 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/fisa-court-explainer-trnd/index.html\">What is the FISA court and why is it so secretive?</a>, March 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Viral ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4266, "last_name": "Truth Wire", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "viral-truth-wire", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/FAKENEWSSPEAKER.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4266/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Obama secretly flees US - leaves stunning evidence behind.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a fake news blog post ", "statement_date": "2018-03-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
