United States had the lowest percentage of people say that climate change is: 1.&nbsp;Largely man-made, and 2.&nbsp;Leading the world toward environmental ruin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States also tied India for the highest percentage of people agree that climate change is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time, though more Americans disagreed with the statement than Indians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of that gives Limbaugh&rsquo;s claim credence, though there are a couple of caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ipsos MORI research director Bobby Duffy said Limbaugh&rsquo;s conclusion that the United States is the most skeptical country is &quot;probably too simple.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the numbers indicate that the United States is the least likely nation among those surveyed to see climate change as a man-made issue, the majority of Americans -- albeit, not by a huge margin -- still believe that climate change is anthropogenic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Americans aren&rsquo;t scoffing at the general idea of climate change. The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hockey stick gaffes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in &quot;developed&quot; (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a &quot;more affluent and &lsquo;connected&rsquo; population&quot; to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you&rsquo;re looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it&rsquo;s apples to oranges,&quot; he said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Ipsos&rsquo; findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/key-data-points/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>survey</u></a> -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it&rsquo;s mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/06/17/chapter-8-environmental-issues-2/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll</u></a> found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup&rsquo;s 2010 <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147242/worldwide-blame-climate-change-falls-humans.aspx#2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>survey</u></a> of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s slightly below the world&rsquo;s average but far below the rates in developed countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GV4ZfpJB2WSwWGNmcBTx4RTX5DQhQPYeYENaZP1jyTxn44GaayNk5Xew_YQlzJW2kvNOk-oyrEt9EtucLICGZP8NSuwlDzG0vgxTpYdcfOtUOQjIQVy4WPBRGhpWZmW9Bw\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0rad); border:none; height:347px; transform:rotate(0rad); width:550px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it&rsquo;s politics&nbsp;that is causing the skepticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limbaugh said that the United States is &quot;the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn&rsquo;t capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, <em>the </em>most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Limbaugh&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-29T11:40:34.450025", "ruling_date": "2014-07-29T12:15:59", "ruling_headline": "Limbaugh: U.S. leads the world in climate doubt", "ruling_headline_slug": "limbaugh-us-leads-world-climate-doubt", "ruling_link_text": "Global lukewarming", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Bobby Duffy, managing director of the Social Research Institute at Ipsos MORI, July 27. 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Riley Dunlap, environmental sociology professor at the Oklahoma State University, July 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Steven Kull, public opinion researcher at the University of Maryland, July 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ipsos Mori, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/environment.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Global Trends 2014: Environment</u></a>,&quot; July 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-more-skeptical-of-climate-change-than-others-in-global-survey/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Americans more skeptical of climate change than others in global survey</u></a>, July 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/key-data-points/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research</u></a>, Jan. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/09/22/chapter-5-environmental-issues/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Chapter 5: Environmental Issues</u></a>, Sept. 22, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallup, Worldwide, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147242/worldwide-blame-climate-change-falls-humans.aspx#2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Blame for Climate Change Falls on Humans</u></a>, April 22, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times, </em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/02/us/reagan-and-environment-to-many-a-stalemate.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Reagan and the Environment</u></a>, Jan. 2, 1989</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>American Behavioral Scientist, </em><a href=\"http://abs.sagepub.com/content/57/6/699.full.pdf+html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Climate Change Denial Books and Conservative Think Tanks</u></a>, May 14, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Guardian, </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/14/funding-climate-change-denial-thinktanks-network\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Secret funding helped build vast network of climate denial think tanks</u></a>, Feb. 14, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Radio host", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "Rush", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "", "id": 156, "last_name": "Limbaugh", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "rush-limbaugh", "pants_count": 10, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rush_limbaugh6.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/156/", "total_count": 39, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/"}, "statement": "<p>The United States is the leading nation in the world &quot;with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on his radio show", "statement_date": "2014-07-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Most scientists agree that climate change is real and humans are causing it.
