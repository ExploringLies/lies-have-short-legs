The article reported that Evers said tax dollars should be used to pay for abortions, just as they do for tonsillectomies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, this was the exchange:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Weekly Standard reporter:</strong> One story I&#39;m interested in is the role of pro-life Democrats: Do they have a place in the party? There&#39;ve been fewer and fewer in Congress. What is your message to them? Do you want to see Medicaid funding of abortion generally? I know that&#39;s restricted in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Evers:</strong> Yeah, we have a big tent here in Wisconsin. We have to, in order to win elections. And yes, pro-life Democrats are welcome in the party, and I respect their decisions on this issue. But we need to have the Medicaid money be available for all people and restricting it because of a certain procedure, whether it&#39;s a tonsillectomy or any other procedure, seems to me a foolhardy thing to do. So, yes, we have to respect people&#39;s pro-life beliefs, and certainly they&#39;re welcome in the Democratic Party.
