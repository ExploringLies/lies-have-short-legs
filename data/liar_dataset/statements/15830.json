Republicans and Democrats either want credit for any progress being made, or want to blame the other side for any lack of progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Michael Lee, a Republican from Wilmington, is gearing up for re-election against Harper Peterson, a former Wilmington mayor.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeeForNC/status/1034505663869841410\" target=\"_blank\">He tweeted</a>&nbsp;on Aug. 28 that &quot;teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher&rsquo;s unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did teacher pay increase over the past five years?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the average teacher salary from the past five years:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates-2015-03-11a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2013-14</a>: $44,990</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates-2015-03-11a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2014-15</a>: $47,819</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/2016_NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2015-16</a>: $47,985</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/2017_Rankings_and_Estimates_Report-FINAL-SECURED.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2016-17</a>: $49,837</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/180413-Rankings_And_Estimates_Report_2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2017-18</a>: $50,861</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those teacher salaries also include supplements, but those are provided by the local district and not the General Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers do not take into consideration any rise in health care premiums, cost-of-living or other expenses. The average rate of inflation over the course of these years was 2.3 percent, based on information from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet\" target=\"_blank\">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, it does appear that teachers got a pay raise every year. However, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/fbs/finance/salary/\" target=\"_blank\">salary schedules</a>&nbsp;from the North Carolina Department of Instruction tell a slightly different story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers with 35 years of experience were being paid $52,150 in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/fbs/finance/salary/schedules/2013-14schedules.pdf\">2013-14 school year</a>.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/fbs/finance/salary/schedules/2014-15schedules.pdf\">2014-15 school year</a>, the base salary for teachers with 25 years of experience or more dropped to $50,000. The 2016&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/fbs/budget/holdharmless16-17.pdf\">&quot;Held Harmless&quot; statute</a>&nbsp;made sure no teacher would make less in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. So, those teachers did not receive a pay cut in the following years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average pay did increase every year after the 2013-14 school year. In the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/fbs/finance/salary/schedules/2017-18schedules.pdf\">2017-18 academic year</a>, teachers with 35 years of experience were paid $51,300. Basically, teachers who reach 35 years of experience today because they are now included in the overall &quot;25-year-plus&quot; category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Clarification: An earlier version of this story said teachers received pay cuts following the 2013-14 academic year. However, we neglected to factor in the &quot;Held Harmless&quot; statute that prevents teacher pay cuts.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the same story for teachers with 36 years of experience. They were paid $53,180 in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/fbs/finance/salary/schedules/2013-14schedules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2013-14 academic year</a>, but teachers who reach 36 years of experience would&rsquo;ve been paid $50,000 in the 2014-15 academic year. In the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/fbs/finance/salary/schedules/2017-18schedules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2017-18 academic year</a>, these teachers were paid $51,300 as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2017/Bills/Senate/PDF/S99v6.pdf\" target=\"_self\">&quot;Held Harmless&quot; statute&nbsp;</a>has been included in the 2018-19 budgets so no teacher gets a pay cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, teachers with up to four years were the only ones to get a base salary increase in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/fbs/finance/salary/schedules/2015-16schedules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2015-16 academic year</a>. They were paid $33,000 in 2014-15, and then paid $35,000 in 2015-16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following years, first-year teachers did not see an increase to their base salary. It stayed at $35,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How fast did teacher pay increase?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Carolina was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/180413-Rankings_And_Estimates_Report_2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ranked second</a>&nbsp;in having the fastest teacher pay raise in 2016-17 nationally, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nea.org/home/2580.htm?cpssessionid=SID-1769E117-010E903A\" target=\"_blank\">National Education Association</a>. This is where Lee&rsquo;s legislative assistant, Emily Barnes, says Lee got his information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, that hasn&rsquo;t always been the case. In the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates-2015-03-11a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2013-14</a>&nbsp;academic year, North Carolina was ranked 48th for percentage change in average teacher salary, with a -1.6 percent change. The state also ranked 41st in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/2017_Rankings_and_Estimates_Report-FINAL-SECURED.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2015-16</a>&nbsp;academic year for teacher pay raises with a 0.3 percent change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Carolina did rank first in teacher&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/2016_NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates.pdf\" target=\"_self\">pay raise in 2014-15</a>&nbsp;with a 6.3 percent change from the previous year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers did get a salary increase in each of the past five years under Republican leadership. However, despite the &quot;Held Harmless&quot; statute, teachers who reach 25 years of experience or more today would not make as much as they would have in 2013-14. That&rsquo;s the main wrinkle in Lee&rsquo;s claim. North Carolina ranked second in fastest-rising teacher pay in 2016-17, though the ranking wasn&rsquo;t consistent over the years. We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters&rsquo; Lab and PolitiFact.
