The figures come from a census of about 95 percent of state employers, and are viewed as the most accurate measure of employment in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers, which show an increase of more than 23,000 jobs in 2011, will eventually be used to update the less-accurate monthly BLS numbers Barrett has used to claim a jobs decline.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the May 31, 2012 debate at Marquette University, Barrett said of Walker: &quot;I&#39;m saying that he came up with a new set of numbers that are based on a new set of numbers that are used but are not commonly used.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo just how common are these numbers?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve visited this issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe last time this flared up, we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/24/scott-walker/recall-battle-wisconsin-gov-scott-says-new-figures/\">False</a> Walker&rsquo;s claim that the jobs numbers were &quot;final&quot; because the feds had not yet verified them.
