The evidence? That Obama supports <a href=\"http://gaylife.about.com/od/politics/p/barackobama.htm\">adoption by</a> <a href=\"http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=9965&amp;MediaType=1&amp;Category=25\">same-sex couples</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/presidential-memorandum-extension-benefits-same-sex-domestic-partners-federal-emplo\">extended benefits</a> to same-sex domestic partners of federal employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that didn&#39;t come close to proving the claim. The links don&rsquo;t address: a) doctors b) surrogacy c) buying babies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNor do they address whether Obama would be interested in such an action. And a group that lobbies for equal treatment of gays and lesbians hasn&rsquo;t seen any such evidence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We cannot find any remotely related action or statement by the president or his administration that would lead anyone to such an outrageous conclusion,&quot; said Brian Moulton, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts in surrogacy from a medical perspective had a similar reaction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have no idea what this claim is based on,&quot; said Eleanor Nicoll, public affairs manager for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut even if Obama were interested, he would find a nearly impossible task (short of, say, suspending the rule of law).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether surrogacy is legal is a matter of state law, not federal. In the District of Columbia, for example, attorneys could serve jail time for helping write a contract between prospective parents and a woman who wants to carry their child. In other states, surrogacy varies from perfectly legal to functionally impossible, according to a <a href=\"https://www.creativefamilyconnections.com/articles/FamilyAdvocateSurrogacyAcrossAmerica.pdf\">summary of state regulation</a> from Maryland law firm Creative Family Connections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMichael Tanner, an expert in health care policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed out that even if the Obama administration managed to require non-discriminatory coverage for artificial reproductive technology in its health care law, doctors don&rsquo;t have to accept insurance, and they don&rsquo;t have to perform procedures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They can&#39;t supersede the surrogacy laws. They can&#39;t force physicians,&quot; he said. &quot;... That has got to be the most bizarre claim I have ever seen in my life.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe called it &quot;a fevered dream.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJonathan Rauch, author of<em> Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America</em>, and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution told us, &quot;Even a sane version of this claim is imaginary.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA newspaper ad claimed that &quot;Barack Hussein Obama will &hellip; force doctors to assist homosexuals in buying surrogate babies.&quot; There&rsquo;s no evidence Obama is interested in such a requirement.
