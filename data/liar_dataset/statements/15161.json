(But as our friends at <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-all-female-responsible-bridge-collapse/\">Snopes</a> point out, this choice is a somewhat ironic considering FIGG&rsquo;s CEO is a woman.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A visit to MCM&rsquo;s homepage clearly shows the company is not staffed exclusively by women &mdash; not by a long shot. In fact, the MCM website page that features <a href=\"http://www.mcm-us.com/about-us/executive-board\">key personnel</a> does not include a single woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to MCM&rsquo;s website, the company is fully owned and managed by five brothers: Raul Munilla, Juan Munilla, Jorge Munilla, Lou Munilla, Fernando Munilla and Pedro Munilla (seen below, from left to right).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Board-of-Directors\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JrQMT-aOka3sLac15WiL8EuhL5ugNQuC9m66o32C4hRh6ofWWVACczbZei1JEdsJ9rzbOgUzeMogDpQO1YGERDx9yAsWlH55QpdZ3a_ANqIt3ISG17IyqOmcSIEa55mnJ2wgoluw\" style=\"border:none; height:403px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for MCM&rsquo;s vice president? Its manager of general construction? Or its regional operations director for Texas? All men, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Although the company has several women in very responsible roles, the ownership is made up of the Munilla brothers and their families,&quot; said Donald Silver, a spokesman for MCM. &quot;It is so unfortunate that some junk news sites chose to carry unsubstantiated stories that were false and hurtful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To bolster the flimsy case against women construction workers, the Squawker article places great weight on an interview between an MCM employee and her alma mater, Florida International University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM and a 1998 graduation of FIU, was interviewed for an article that would appear on FIU&rsquo;s website about the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter, because I think women have a different perspective. We&rsquo;re able to put in an artistic touch and we&rsquo;re able to build, too,&quot; Flores told FIU in an <a href=\"https://news.fiu.edu/2018/03/community-gathers-to-watch-950-ton-bridge-move-across-southwest-8th-street/120395\">article</a> that ran March 3, less than two weeks before the March 15 bridge collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Squawker article pointed to Flores&rsquo; quote as proof that MCM had allowed senior-ranking female employees to prioritize aesthetics over safety. The Squawker article characterizes Flores&rsquo; quote as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;Leonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty. Nothing else matters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s set to one side this rather extreme reading of Flores&rsquo; quote. An update to the FIU article issued a day after the bridge collapse clarified that &quot;Leonor Flores did not work on the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge project in any capacity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silver, the MCM spokesman, confirmed Flores was not the project manager on the FIU pedestrian bridge construction project.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A video blogger said an all-female construction company built the Florida bridge that collapsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the two companies responsible for building the bridge &mdash; and the focus of the conspiracy theory &mdash; is MCM, which is owned and managed by five brothers. MCM&rsquo;s vice president, manager of general construction and its Texas operations director are all men. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM, who has figured into the conspiracy theory as something of a scapegoat, had no involvement in FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge, according to her alma mater FIU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-20T17:04:24.041246", "ruling_date": "2018-03-20T17:07:54", "ruling_headline": "No, it was not an all-female company that built the bridge that collapsed in Florida", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-it-was-not-all-female-company-built-bridge-coll", "ruling_link_text": "Just wrong", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykoOLSlzuEc\">Florida Bridge Collapse, All Female Company</a>,&quot; March 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Squawker, &quot;<a href=\"https://squawker.org/culture-wars/a-female-led-construction-company-built-the-florida-bridge-that-collapsed/\">A Female-Led Construction Company Built The Florida Bridge That Collapsed</a>,&quot; March 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Don Silver, spokesman for Munilla Construction Management, March 20, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>An all-female construction company built the Florida bridge that collapsed.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a video blog", "statement_date": "2018-03-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
