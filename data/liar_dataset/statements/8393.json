Bob McDonnell said there is a pox on both political parties for causing the federal government&rsquo;s partial shutdown. But he insisted the biggest welts are on the backs of President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McDonnell, a Republican, noted that 49 states require the passage of balanced budgets each year. That includes Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re incredulous, at the state level, it&rsquo;s been four and a half years since the United States Senate has passed a budget, a spending blueprint for America,&quot; McDonnell said. &quot;You know, no business, no state, no local government, no church, no synagogue, or a family could ever run like that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the interview, McDonnell repeated that the Senate has not passed a budget in 4-1/2 years. We asked for asked for elaboration and Tucker Martin, McDonnell&rsquo;s chief of communications, sent us a PolitiFact Tennessee article from September 2012. It gave Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn, a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/28/bob-corker/bob-corker-says-senate-has-not-passed-budget-more-/\"><u>True</u></a> rating for saying the Senate has failed to pass a budget in &quot;more than three years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That Truth-O-Meter item said Senate hadn&rsquo;t passed a budget since April 29, 2009. &nbsp;But things have changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate, on March 23 this year, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/us/politics/senate-passes-3-7-trillion-budget-its-first-in-4-years.html?_r=0\"><u>passed</u></a> a $3.7 trillion budget on a 50-49 vote that maintained entitlements -- such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare -- and discretionary domestic programs. It differed from a $3.5 trillion <a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/summary_tablesfy14.pdf\"><u>House budget</u></a>, <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/21/17401829-house-passes-budget-for-2014-sends-2013-spending-bill-to-obama?lite\"><u>passed</u></a> three days earlier, that significantly cut entitlement programs and deficits over the coming decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efforts to send the competing budgets to a conference committee have been <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/tea-party-vs-old-guard-gop-senate-rift-224955426.html\"><u>unsuccessful</u></a>, however. A group of Tea Party senators has <a href=\"http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/could-democrats-work-around-the-budget-bullies/\"><u>blocked motions</u></a> -- which need unanimous consent -- to advance the Senate&rsquo;s spending plan. They have insisted on assurances that the budget negotiations would not lead to higher taxes and voiced concern that a conference committee could create momentum for procedures that thwart filibusters against increasing the nation&#39;s debt limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McDonnell said the U.S. Senate hasn&rsquo;t passed a budget in four and a half years. His information is out of date. The Senate passed a budget in March. A group of Republican senators has &nbsp;blocked efforts to begin budget negotiations with the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a difference a year makes for this claim.
