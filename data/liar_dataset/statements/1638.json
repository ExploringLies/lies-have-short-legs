Charlie Crist wasted no time attacking primary opponent Marco Rubio  in a nationally televised debate on <em>FOX News Sunday.</em><br /><br />\"I  view public service as a calling, something that you do to try to help  other people, to improve their lives, their quality of life,\" said  Crist. \"Unfortunately, recent news accounts in Florida have come out  that indicate, in fact, that Speaker Rubio views public service as a way  to enhance his personal enrichment.\"<br /><br />Crist said that Rubio had  set up a $600,000 \"slush fund\" that he used for personal expenses rather  than political purposes.<br /><br />\"In fact, out of the $600,000 that were  raised, only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances  to be elected to office. That's not what people want. They want people  who are not there to enrich themselves but who are there to enrich the  lives of their fellow Floridians.\"<br /><br />Crist's statement is based on  an investigation into Rubio's finances by the <em>Miami Herald </em>and <em>St. Petersburg Times</em>.<br /><br />Rubio, the former speaker of the  Florida House, controlled two separate political committees, according  to the report. In December 2002, Rubio created Floridians for  Conservative Leadership, which raised $228,000 in donations. At the end  of 2003, he created Floridians for Conservative Leadership in  Government, which raised $386,000. Of those two committees, it's true  that only $4,000 went to direct contributions to political candidates.<br /><br />Crist,  meanwhile, conflates the two committees together to get to his $600,000  \"slush fund.\" But there's an important distinction between the two: The  purpose of the first fund was to \"support state and local candidates  who espouse conservative government policies.\" It was registered with  the state of Florida and allowed to give contributions to political  candidates. The $4,000 in direct campaign contributions came out of this  fund of $228,000. The <em>Herald/Times </em>review of other legislators'  committees showed that they typically contributed far more to other  candidates and reported vastly fewer credit card payments. <br /><br />According to the <em>Herald/Times</em> report: \"Rubio spent the biggest chunk of the committee's money, $89,000, on political consultants, $14,000 in reimbursements to himself, and more than $51,000 in credit card expenses. Records show those expenses were for food, lodging and airfare but do not detail who was traveling or where expenses were incurred.\"<br /><br />The  second fund was to \"educate the public about conservative leadership in  government.\" It was a 527 fund, registered with the Internal Revenue  Service, but not the state of Florida. Because it was not registered  with the state, it was not allowed to donate money to political  candidates, and indeed it did not. According to the <em>Herald/Times </em>report,  most of the money, about $236,430, from this second fund went to pay  for Republican poltiical consultants. <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/marco-rubios-lavish-rise-to-the-top/1079473\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Read more details about the expenses in the  Times-Herald report.\">Read more details about the expenses in the Herald/Times report.</a><br /><br />We contacted the Rubio campaign after  the debate for a response to Crist's charges. Campaign spokesman Alberto  Martinez reiterated that the committees' operations were entirely  within the law, and that all the money was spent advancing conservative  causes, even if it didn't go directly to other candidates. The second  fund wasn't allowed to give contributions, anyway, he added. It was  intended to help Rubio travel around the state to promote conservative  ideas to the general public. <br /><br />Crist also said during the debate  that of the $600,000, \"it's been shown lately it's been used to fix his  minivan, get haircuts, employ family members, things of this nature that  are not what a political committee is supposed to do.\" But Crist here  is mixing Rubio's two political groups with a separate issue: Rubio  had access to a credit card for the Republican Party of Florida, and  that's what he used to pay for the minivan and and hair bills. Rubio has  said the minivan charge was for damage to his car that occurred at a  political event, and the hair charges also included items for a silent  auction event that he ended up paying for himself. <br /><br />Here, we're  ruling on Crist's statement that \"out of the $600,000 that were raised,  only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances to be  elected to office.\" He's right about the $4,000. But he arrives at the  $600,000 number by conflating two separate funds, one of which was not  permitted to give to candidate campaigns. So we rate Crist's statement  Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-29T15:04:16.251528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-29T16:39:01", "ruling_headline": "Crist attacks Rubio on campaign
