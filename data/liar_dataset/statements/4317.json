The port [is] 200 miles closer to Europe than any other Eastern port,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to, I think, focus on turning that into an economic engine.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe statement sent us scrambling for our maps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&#39;re not cartographers, but it seemed to us that Boston is a bit east of Providence. And what about ports in Maine or New Hampshire?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe got <a href=\"https://2bts.rita.dot.gov/external_links/water_ports.html\">a list of ports</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext we tracked down the westernmost part of Europe. Lisbon, Portugal, seemed to be the best candidate. Actually, it&rsquo;s Cabo da Roca, about 26 miles west of Lisbon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut because of Earth&#39;s curvature, that&#39;s not the closest point to New England. Dublin, on Ireland&rsquo;s eastern coast, is 171 miles closer to Providence than Cabo da Roca. Ireland&rsquo;s western coast is even closer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we turned to <a href=\"http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm\">Google Maps</a>, and asked for the distance, as the crow flies, to Dublin (to pick a relative landmark). Here&#39;s the result:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Providence: 3,030 miles (and a <em>very</em> tired crow)<br />\r\nFrom Boston: 2,993 miles (37 miles closer than Providence)<br />\r\nFrom Portsmouth, N.H.: 2,950 miles (80 miles closer)<br />\r\nFrom Portland, Maine: 2,906 miles (124 miles closer)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we contacted Bennett, he promised to call us back in five minutes. Four minutes later, we got a call instead from the spokesman for Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, David Ortiz, saying he would handle the question. A day later, Ortiz wrote us to say Bennett &quot;regrets the narrow error of fact.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Mr. Bennett misspoke; he picked up the incorrect information about the Port of Providence&rsquo;s geographic proximity to Europe in a recent conversation about the port&rsquo;s assets, competitive advantages and potential to compete with other major Eastern commercial ports for the European market,&quot; Ortiz said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn short, Bennett said Providence&#39;s port is 200 miles closer to Europe than any other port on the East Coast.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only way that&#39;s true is if you ignore the ports in every coastal state north of us.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s not even true when you consider the major port facilities in New York, which are about 155 miles to our west, not 200.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, whether you&#39;re looking east or looking west, Bennett&#39;s statement is plain wrong. His spokesman may call it a &quot;narrow error of fact,&quot; but we hope that when he gives a pitch to a developer in his new role, he avoids such errors, narrow or otherwise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur compass, the Truth-O-Meter, points to False.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
