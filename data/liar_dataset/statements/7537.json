Tom Coburn, R-Okla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Cell phones</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back his claim that the federal government spent $2.2 billion on &quot;free cell phones,&quot; Duffy cited a February 2013 <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323511804578296001368122888.html\">article</a> in The Wall Street Journal and a 2012 Federal Communications Commission <a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reforms-modernizes-lifeline-program-low-income-americans-0\">report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Journal revealed that the government spent $2.2 billion in 2012 on phone subsidies for the poor, but that more than 2 million people served by the <a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/guides/lifeline-and-link-affordable-telephone-service-income-eligible-consumers\">Lifeline</a> program hadn&rsquo;t proved they were eligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifeline, which is funded by fees paid by all cell and landline customers, is available to low-income people, including those on Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wireless carriers often offer free phones to Lifeline customers, the FCC report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/31/adam-putnam/putnam-obama-campaign-gives-free-cell-phones-suppo/\">in 2012</a> and PolitiFact Texas <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/mar/15/steve-stockman/steve-stockman-says-president-spending-22-billion-/\">in 2013</a> examined similar claims about free cell phones -- although those claims, unlike Duffy&rsquo;s, tied the program directly to Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifeline started in 1985 to subsidize home phone service; cell service was added in 2008 under President George W. Bush. Subsidies for cell service now make up 75 percent of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifeline doesn&rsquo;t actually give away phones, but rather pays an average of $9.25 (the subsidy varies by state) to a user&rsquo;s phone company toward monthly home or cell service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, many people end up with a free phone from a cellular carrier if they sign up for cell service with Lifeline. <a href=\"http://www.assurancewireless.com/Public/MorePrograms.aspx\">Assurance</a> Wireless, for example, advertises a variety of Lifeline plans, as well as a free phone. Both the Coburn report and the FCC report also note that, to attract Lifeline customers, many carriers offer free phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, most but not all of the $2.2 billion in the Lifeline program subsidizes cellular bills. And, although the program itself doesn&rsquo;t give away phones, it&rsquo;s common for customers to end up with a free phone as a result of Lifeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Pottery classes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy cited a December 2011 <a href=\"http://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/7-608-12-002-p.pdf\">federal audit</a> to support his statement that the United States &nbsp;spends &quot;$27 million on Moroccan pottery classes&quot; (a claim that&rsquo;s also been <a href=\"http://www.billoreilly.com/currentarticle\">made by</a> conservative talk show host Bill O&rsquo;Reilly).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audit evaluated a $27 million project of the U.S. Agency for International Development that was begun in 2009 &quot;to provide technical assistance to improve Morocco&rsquo;s economic enabling environment by improving the business climate, using water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthening workforce development.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the program is broader than what Duffy claimed, although the audit did single out pottery classes. Local residents reported that the classes from a U.S.-based trainer were ineffective, partly because the trainer spoke only English and the trainer&rsquo;s translator wasn&rsquo;t fluent in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coburn&rsquo;s book also highlighted the pottery classes, but <a href=\"http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=3b872d11-b6b5-4f72-9a0f-f95c79c99b6f\">noted</a> that only part of the $27 million went toward them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Duffy is wrong on this part of his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Watermelon queen</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third part of Duffy&rsquo;s claim was that the federal government &quot;pays for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama.&quot; He cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5100734\">document</a> on fruit and vegetable projects funded in all 50 states in fiscal 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alabama got $401,366 for 13 projects, including one to &quot;partner with the Alabama Watermelon Association to promote the consumption of Alabama&rsquo;s watermelon through appearances of the <a href=\"http://www.alwatermelon.org/#%21queen-program\">Alabama Watermelon Queen</a> at various events and locations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coburn book said $25,000 in federal money went toward the queen&rsquo;s travel expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Duffy is correct on this part of his claim, although it should be made clear that Uncle Sam picks up only part of the queen&rsquo;s tab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy said the federal government spends &quot;$2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes&quot; and pays for &quot;the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Duffy&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-19T18:24:32.131052", "ruling_date": "2013-03-24T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sean Duffy: Uncle Sam pays for cell phones, pottery classes in Morocco and watermelon queen's travel", "ruling_headline_slug": "uncle-sam-pays-free-cell-phones-pottery-classes-mo", "ruling_link_text": "Mostly distortions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WISN-TV, <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/President-to-meet-with-House-Republicans/-/10057538/19251824/-/ldqww5/-/index.html\">interview</a> (quote at 4:50) with U.S. Rep.
