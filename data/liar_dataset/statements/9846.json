Charlie Crist in a TV <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/azlxr5g26ak4tqo/Untitled%20Project%2019-HD%20720p.mov\">ad</a> alleging that he let Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein pick judicial appointments in exchange for campaign donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist&rsquo;s campaign fired back with its own <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2014/08/shady-rick-scott-and-for-sale-charlie-crist-punch-counterpunch-in-new-round-of-mean-ads.html\">ad</a>&nbsp;Aug. 18 that included a slew of attacks on Scott, including this one:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now he&rsquo;s teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text on the screen states &quot;Rothstein gets 50 years in $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist&rsquo;s ad shows a photo of a grinning Rothstein wearing luxury watches and attributes that to an ABC News story from June 2010 when Rothstein was convicted. The <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/azlxr5g26ak4tqo/Untitled%20Project%2019-HD%20720p.mov\">Republicans&rsquo; ad about Rothstein</a> used the same image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the photo of Rothstein remains on the screen, the text of the ad says: &quot;Scott Rothstein bought expensive things&quot; and then the text on the screen says &quot;FALSE ATTACKS.&quot; (The small print refers to a <em>Sun-Sentinel </em>article about an auction of Rothstein&#39;s possessions.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a whole lot of Rothstein mash-up going on for viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For nearly five years, media reports have outlined how Rothstein donated generously to a long list of politicians including Crist. But this was the first we had heard of an allegation about Scott teaming up with Rothstein, so we decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, there is no evidence that Scott and Rothstein have literally &quot;teamed up&quot; -- what Crist is referring to is the Republican Party using the Rothstein scandal to attack Crist. The evidence that Crist cited in his ad backup was simply a news report about Rothstein&rsquo;s conviction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ponzi schemer&#39;s words + Rick Scott&#39;s money = teaming up,&quot; Brendan Gilfillan told PolitiFact Florida in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the backstory on Rothstein&rsquo;s connection to Crist: Rothstein was a big campaign donor to Crist and the Republican Party back when Crist was still a Republican. And Crist did put Rothstein on a panel that recommended some appeals court judges. Rothstein testified that he gave money and in exchange directed Crist&rsquo;s judicial picks to the appeals bench in West Palm Beach and the Broward bench.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we found no hard evidence that proved Rothstein dictated Crist&rsquo;s picks, so we rated that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/aug/25/republican-party-florida/republicans-ad-says-scott-rothstein-bought-charlie/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rothstein exited Florida politics, and then Scott entered</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as the news surfaced about the investigation into Rothstein, the long line of politicians and political entities opening their arms to receive his donations screeched to a halt. In fact, many of them gave the money back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott had the good fortune to avoid Rothstein due to his timing: He entered his first race for governor in April 2010. By that date, Rothstein was behind bars and no longer a mega-campaign donor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal authorities revealed they were investigating Rothstein&rsquo;s scheme in November 2009 and arrested him Dec. 1, 2009. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in June 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rothstein and his firm had given generously to candidates and politicians in both parties: as much as<a href=\"http://databases.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/ftlaudrothstein/ftlaudrothstein_list.php?id=1&amp;a=showall\"> $3 million</a> to local, state, federal candidates and political entities between 2005 and 2009. That included donations to Crist, the Republican Party of Florida and the Florida Democratic Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where was Scott during Rothstein&rsquo;s scheme?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott was a Republican millionaire businessman in Naples who built his career around the health care industry. Scott was forced out of the company he formed, Columbia/HCA, in 1997 amid lawsuits over Medicare billing practices that ultimately led to a $1.7 billion federal fine. In 2001, Scott cofounded Solantic Corp., a chain of walk-in urgent care centers he would later <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/gov-rick-scott-finalizes-deal-to-sell-his-holdings-in-urgent-care-chain/1163630\">sell</a> after he became governor. In 2009, Scott used $5 million of his own money to form <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/10/AR2009051002243.html\">Conservatives for Patients Rights</a> to fight Obama&rsquo;s health care reform. In 2010, he ran for governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Scott&#39;s campaign if Scott had ever crossed paths with Rothstein and did not get a response, but we could find no evidence that they had ever met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist&rsquo;s TV ad says Rick Scott has &quot;teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ad is vague and confusing. Scott hasn&rsquo;t teamed up with Ponzi schemer Rothstein -- he was arrested in December 2009 and Scott entered his first race for governor in April 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only kind of teaming up that happened is that the Republican Party of Florida made a TV ad attacking Crist for his connections to Rothstein in an&nbsp;ad that PolitiFact Florida rated&nbsp;Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teaming up implies that Scott and Rothstein are in cahoots, and we&rsquo;re not aware of any evidence that they crossed paths. When Scott announced his first campaign in April 2010, Rothstein had already been arrested and was awaiting sentencing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-29T14:28:32.564999", "ruling_date": "2014-09-02T10:59:04", "ruling_headline": "Crist says Scott 'teamed up' with Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein to falsely attack him ", "ruling_headline_slug": "crist-says-rick-scott-teamed-ponzi-schemer-scott-r", "ruling_link_text": "Not in cahoots, but GOP sure likes to remind Crist about his Ponzi pal", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Charlie Crist campaign, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFNrJCJ9pHw\">&quot;Smears&quot; TV ad</a>, Aug. 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>,<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/gov-rick-scott-finalizes-deal-to-sell-his-holdings-in-urgent-care-chain/1163630\"> &quot;Governor Rick Scott&nbsp;finalizes deal to sell holdings in urgent care chain Solantic,&quot;</a> April 13, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;Republican ad says Scott Rothstein bought Charlie Crist&rsquo;s judicial appointments,&quot; Aug. 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Brendan Gilfillan, spokesman for Charlie Crist&rsquo;s campaign, Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican Party of Florida, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/azlxr5g26ak4tqo/Untitled%20Project%2019-HD%20720p.mov\">&quot;For sale&quot; TV ad</a>, Aug. 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Court District of Florida, Scott Rothstein transcript in the Christina Kitterman trial, February 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Division of Elections, <a href=\"http://election.dos.state.fl.us/campaign-finance/cam-finance-index.shtml\">State campaign finance records</a>, 2006-2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Election Commission, <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\">Campaign finance records</a>, 2006-2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00002942&amp;cycle=2010&amp;type=I&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=100\">Charlie Crist Top 100 Contributors</a>, 2009-10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov.
