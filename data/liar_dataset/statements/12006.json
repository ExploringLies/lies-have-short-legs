We&rsquo;re knee-deep in a presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a reason for having this tradition of not nominating somebody in the middle of a presidential election, because it gets so political.

Often, the administration gets a read on where the Senate stands on confirming a nominee before putting someone forward. But formally, the timing for the first step is up to the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found five instances over roughly the past century in which there was a Supreme Court vacancy in a presidential election year and the president made a nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>President</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Nominee</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Nomination</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Outcome</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Franklin Roosevelt (D)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Frank Murphy, to replace Pierce Butler</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>January 1940</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Confirmed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Herbert Hoover (R)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Benjamin Cardozo, to replace Oliver Wendell Holmes</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>February 1932</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Confirmed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Woodrow Wilson (D)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Louis Brandeis, to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>January 1916</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Confirmed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Woodrow Wilson (D)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>John Clarke, to replace Charles Evans Hughes</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>July 1916</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Confirmed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>William Taft</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mahlon Pitney, to replace John Marshall Harlan</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>February 1912</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Confirmed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">Technically, there was not a vacancy, but Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations in June 1968, five months before the election.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire.
