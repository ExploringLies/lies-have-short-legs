A 32-year-old woman named <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-heather-heyer-profile/index.html\">Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured</a> before Fields was arrested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after, PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said the Challenger had actually belonged to Vangheluwe, who was &quot;a known antifa/anti Trump supporter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antifa is shorthand for antifascist. It&rsquo;s a catch-all term for demonstrators who organize on the local level to protest far-right causes, often resorting to violence. The loosely coordinated movement has roots in antifascist groups in <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/what-antifa-anti-fascism-protesters-and-white-power-groups-explained-650232\">Germany, Italy and Spain before World War II</a>, and has grown increasingly visible in its opposition to Trump and his &quot;alt-right&quot; supporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PuppetStringNews.com alleged that Vangheluwe, whose <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/joel.notavailable?fref=search\">Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home</a>, drove the Challenger into the crowd to make it look like a Trump supporter had attacked the protesters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no proof Vangheluwe was involved in any way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio vehicle records showed the 2010 Dodge Challenger is currently registered to Fields, who was <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/charlottesville-suspect-held-hate-group-shield-attack-article-1.3407245\">at the Charlottesville rally</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CvilleCityHall/status/896750298156470273\">arrested shortly after the incident</a>. Fields has been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, and was denied bail <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/charlottesville-suspect-james-alex-fields-jr-denied-bond-first-court-n792381\">at a hearing on Aug. 14</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PuppetStringNews.com post included a batch of images of Facebook and Instagram posts from Joel Vangheluwe and registration information from SearchQuarry.com that showed Joel&rsquo;s father, Jerome, had once owned the car:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears these images <a href=\"http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/137122101/charlottesville-ram-was-a-commie\">originated on 4chan.org</a>, an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of the so-called evidence showed anything proving Vangheluwe was a violent, left-wing extremist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10203908667787776&amp;set=pb.1553943587.-2207520000.1502724424.&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">Facebook image dated July 4, 2015</a>, that was posted on PuppetStringNews.com showed Vangheluwe did have a liberal bent:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nationalism is brainwash, we&#39;ll always be separated until we come together, shit man the world and its people are beautiful. Not just America, pro world,&quot; Vangheluwe&rsquo;s caption read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another image apparent in the PuppetStringNews.com post showed a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BVYjdX4lTE6/?taken-by=joelvanart\">June 15 Instagram photo of Vangheluwe</a> wearing a shirt with Jimi Hendrix on it. Vangheluwe&rsquo;s selfie was simply announcing two art shows in Detroit:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The most outspoken post on any of his social media profiles looked to be from Jan. 24, when he wrote, &quot;If only Trump was aborted&quot; as a Facebook status:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sommerman said that Jerome Vangheluwe, Joel&rsquo;s father, did own the Challenger years ago, and that Joel Vangheluwe did not like Trump, but any implications beyond that are, to use Sommerman&rsquo;s word, &quot;nuts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He said some negative things about Trump that aren&rsquo;t nice,&quot; Sommerman said. &quot;He doesn&rsquo;t support the president in everything he does.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>PuppetStringNews.com said, &quot;Charlottesville Car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, the car used in the incident is registered to the man currently in custody, not Vangheluwe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site made the implication based on Vangheluwe&rsquo;s social media posts, but a closer look revealed that even those posts didn&rsquo;t reveal very much. We pored over the examples PuppetStringNews.com cited and looked through Vangheluwe&rsquo;s public profiles. There was evidence Vangheluwe did not support Trump, which his lawyer confirmed, but there was nothing to suggest he was a destructive radical bent on violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-14T17:24:29.094922", "ruling_date": "2017-08-14T17:40:25", "ruling_headline": "Charlottesville hit-and-run driver was anti-fascist activist, Internet post claims", "ruling_headline_slug": "charlottesville-hit-and-run-driver-was-anti-fascis", "ruling_link_text": "False details about falsely accused man", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PuppetStringNews.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.puppetstringnews.com/blog/friendly-firecharlottesville-car-attacker-is-anti-trump-antifa-supporter\">Friendly Fire &hellip;
