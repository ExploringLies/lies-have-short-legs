Obama had been forbidden by her famous parents from going to any such party, the story said, but disappeared before turning up at the police station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This didn&rsquo;t happen, of course, because the story is fake.

Malia&rsquo;s image was inserted to suggest she&rsquo;d been partying with the other seven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not the case.
