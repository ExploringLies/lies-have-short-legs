Rick Perry requiring equal pay for women doing equal work. And in May 2014, Patrick said that as lieutenant governor, he would keep an equal-pay measure from being considered by the full Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/story/local/2014/09/24/14213610/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>As recapped by WFAA-TV, Channel 8</u></a> in Dallas, Patrick said: &quot;I do not think that we should have government telling business how to pay their employees whether they&rsquo;re male or female. I would hold that bill&hellip; Look, women deserve equal pay and if they&rsquo;re doing a better job than the guy they&rsquo;re working next to, they deserve more. It&rsquo;s not up to government.&quot; Patrick added that the lieutenant governor should protect free markets. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want government interfering,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sept. 20, 2014, Tribune CEO Evan Smith interviewed Patrick and Van de Putte back to back on an Austin stage. We watched the video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The equal-pay portion of the conversation opened with Smith asking Patrick to confirm he&rsquo;d previously said: &quot;Women should be paid the same as a man, but I don&rsquo;t believe government should enforce it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Correct,&quot; Patrick said, adding that pay should be based on an individual&rsquo;s performance. &quot;And if a woman does a better job than a man, she deserves to be paid more,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;And we have a lot of women business owners. I don&rsquo;t want the state of Texas telling women business owners you have to pay, listen, you have to pay everyone the same.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith then asked if Patrick thought Texas has an equal pay problem or, alternatively, if critics had overblown the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick: &quot;You know, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem. But to say, are there some businesses that may not treat people fairly? Yes. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem. And I think look, I&rsquo;m a small-business guy; I&rsquo;ve always had a lot of women work for our company. I want the best employees I can have.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith asked next if women who work for Patrick are paid equally as men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick: &quot;In some cases you&rsquo;d find they are paid more. Look, I&rsquo;m a business guy and like every businessman and woman, you want the best people. You don&rsquo;t really care what color they are, where they come from, what gender they are; you want them to do the job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick then reiterated he doesn&rsquo;t want the government imposing pay requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Van de Putte said Patrick said that if women &quot;get paid less than a man for the same job, that that&rsquo;s not a problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broadly, both candidates were vague in their use of &quot;problem,&quot; leaving room for interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Patrick answered a question by saying he doesn&rsquo;t think the equal-pay issue is a problem and he hammered his opposition to any state law mandating equal pay. However, Patrick also said some businesses don&rsquo;t treat people fairly and said any worker should be paid on performance.
