Mark Warner is pitching a plan that would allow some Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled and apply the additional tax revenue toward business tax cuts and incentives to spur the economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaying out his plan in an <a href=\"http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/11/12/am-senator-warner-proposes-a-compromise-on-tax-cuts-/\">Op-Ed in the Financial Times</a>, Warner notes that a Republican-Democrat compromise is being considered by the Obama administration that would temporarily extend all the tax breaks for two more years. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;However, this latter approach has problems beyond the $65bn that would be added to the deficit if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes,&quot; Warner writes. &quot;In Washington such &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; benefits also have a strange way of becoming permanent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Warner&rsquo;s own plan hinges on reapplying the $65 billion in additional tax revenue that would come from allowing the tax breaks for the wealthy to expire, we thought it prudent to check the figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked for the source, Warner&rsquo;s communication director Kevin Hall pointed to estimates by the U.S. Treasury.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose projections show that allowing the cuts to expire along with adjustments to the capital gains and dividends would amount to $74.4 billion over two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s why we mention that factor: If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire as scheduled, the top tax rate on long-term capital gains would rise from 15 percent to 20 percent. Dividends, which are currently taxed at 15 percent, would be taxed at the same rates as ordinary income with a top rate of 39.9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut if we look exclusively at allowing the Bush cuts to expire, it&rsquo;s $62.5 billion for the two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHall said Warner excludes the capital gains and dividends change because they might not be enacted, &quot;and capital gains isn&rsquo;t really what people talk about when they say &lsquo;income taxes.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGerald Prante, senior economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, disagreed on that point. He also &nbsp;suggested looking at more recent figures from the Office of Management and Budget, noting that the Treasury numbers are based upon estimates that have since been revised.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe OMB figures show that allowing the cuts for the wealthy to expire would generate more than $66 billion in tax revenue over two years. But that&rsquo;s including the adjustment to the capital gains.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithout it, the two-year total is closer to $57 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIts worth noting, however, that the numbers from both sources look at the revenue to be gained from repealing the tax cuts permanently as opposed to eliminating them after a two-year extension.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If there was only a two-year extension, the cost may not be $66 billion as [the] Joint Committee on Taxation/Treasury would assume tax planning that could change the costs, moving income between years,&quot; noted Prante. &quot;But overall, Warner&#39;s claim is fine...the $65 billion figure is not an exaggeration.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, if we use the Treasury&rsquo;s numbers, and look exclusively at the tax revenue raised by the two years worth of repealed cuts for the wealthy, then Warner is very close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the more recent OMB figures, he&rsquo;d be nearer &nbsp;by including the capital gains adjustment, but is still in the neighborhood.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccepting that pinpointing a number using evolving projections is not an exact science, we find Warner&rsquo;s claim to be Mostly True.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-12T19:15:13.334566", "ruling_date": "2010-11-14T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Warner says the deficit would grow by $65 billion \"if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes.\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "warner-says-deficit-would-grow-65-billion-if-we-ke", "ruling_link_text": "Warner's numbers add up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFinancial Times, Obama&rsquo;s alternative to repeal of Bush tax cuts, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/99572a20-edd2-11df-9612-00144feab49a.html#axzz155Flu8Ai\">Obama&rsquo;s alternative to repeal of Bush tax cuts</a>&quot;, Nov. 11, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartment of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/greenbk10.pdf\">General Explanations of the Administration&rsquo;s Fiscal Year 2011 Revenue Proposals</a>, February 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOffice of Management and Budget, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/11msr.pdf\">Mid-Session Review</a>, July 23, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/117xx/doc11705/08-18-Update.pdf\">The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update</a>,&nbsp; Aug. 18, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJoint Committee on Taxation, &quot;Present Law And The President&rsquo;s Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Proposals Related To Selected Individual Income Tax Provisions Scheduled To Expire Under The Sunset Provisions Of The Economic Growth And Tax Relief Reconciliation Act Of 2001&quot; (<a href=\"http://jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=3691\">report</a>), July 12, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=2844&amp;DocTypeID=7\">2011 Budget Tax Proposals</a>, accessed Nov. 5, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Gerald Prante, senior economist, The Tax Foundation, Nov. 12, 2010.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Mark", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 61, "last_name": "Warner", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "mark-warner", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-markwarner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/61/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t$65 billion &quot;would be added to the deficit if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "n Op/Ed in The Financial Times", "statement_date": "2010-11-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
