Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article lists as its source a Nov. 9 article from <a href=\"http://defense-usa.club/2017/11/09/breaking-2-million-rounds-ammo-went-missing-obama-turns-enemy-hands/\">defense-usa.club</a>, another known peddler of deliberately <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/\">false news stories.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article attributes the information to &quot;an insider report from the office of the Quartermaster at the Pentagon.&quot; It states that the ammunition went missing in 2010 and was recently recovered by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The article quoted Brig. General George Mason&rsquo;s assistant chief of staff: &quot;This was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the U.S. taxpayer. Sources say the Taliban paid nearly a dollar a round. Someone in Obama&rsquo;s circle pocketed that money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of that, however, appears to be made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched news accounts and found no mentions of missing ammunition discovered in Afghanistan. Major Adrian J.T. Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, told PolitiFact that there hasn&rsquo;t been a recent discovery of 2 million U.S. rounds of ammunition in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To top it off, &quot;We&#39;re not aware of a Brigadier General George Mason in any position of responsibility in Afghanistan,&quot; Rankine-Galloway said. &quot;There&#39;s no such thing as &lsquo;the Quartermaster at the Pentagon.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no evidence that 2 million rounds of U.S. ammunition went missing and were discovered in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-20T12:23:20.201046", "ruling_date": "2017-11-20T13:28:45", "ruling_headline": "Fake news: 2 million rounds of U.S. ammo turns up in Afghanistan", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-news-2-million-rounds-us-ammo-turns-afghanist", "ruling_link_text": "Pentagon says this is wrong", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>World-newss.com,<a href=\"http://world-newss.com/2-million-rounds-of-ammo-that-went-missing-under-obama-turns-up-in-enemy-hands/\"> &quot;2 Million Rounds Of Ammo That &lsquo;Went Missing&rsquo; Under Obama Turns Up In Enemy Hands,&quot;</a> Nov. 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense-usa.com,<a href=\"http://defense-usa.club/2017/11/09/breaking-2-million-rounds-ammo-went-missing-obama-turns-enemy-hands/\"> &quot;BREAKING: 2 Million Rounds Of Ammo That &lsquo;Went Missing&rsquo; Under Obama Turns Up In Enemy Hands,&quot;</a> Nov. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/\">&quot;PolitiFact&#39;s guide to fake news websites and what they peddle,&quot;</a> April 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, U.S. Marines Major Adrian J.T.
