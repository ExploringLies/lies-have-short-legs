Robert Menendez hasn&rsquo;t been doing his job, according to his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a heated debate Wednesday on New Jersey 101.5-FM, the Democratic incumbent and Kyrillos argued over whether the U.S. Senate has passed a budget in the last three years. The two candidates will face off in the Nov. 6 general election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Senate hasn&rsquo;t passed a budget in three years,&quot; said Kyrillos, who represents part of Monmouth County. &quot;That&rsquo;s just a fact, hasn&rsquo;t done it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Menendez said that wasn&rsquo;t true: &quot;Secondly, there is a budget. It&rsquo;s called the Budget Control Act and you should look it up. You&rsquo;d understand then that your statement about not having a budget for the last three years would be wrong.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, is Menendez right that Kyrillos&rsquo; statement is inaccurate and the Senate has passed a budget &quot;called the Budget Control Act&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat legislation performs budgetary functions -- such as setting limits on certain types of future discretionary spending -- but the Act is not a budget plan under the official congressional budget process.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat kind of plan is called a &quot;budget resolution&quot; and the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/12/leonard-lance/congressman-leonard-lance-claims-us-senate-has-not/\">Senate hasn&rsquo;t passed one</a> in more than three years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said in an e-mail that &quot;a completed budget is expected to do much more than set spending levels for discretionary programs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGalston added, &quot;The 2011 BCA kept the government open, but it didn&rsquo;t constitute a full budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s explain what a budget resolution is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe House and Senate are supposed to adopt a budget resolution that covers the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA budget resolution does not become law, but instead serves as the framework for appropriations bills and other subsequent legislation dealing with budgetary matters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith Menendez voting yes, the Senate last passed a budget resolution on April 29, 2009 for fiscal year 2010. In the absence of a budget resolution, Congress has taken other steps to spend money and set certain budgetary guidelines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s turn to the Budget Control Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEnacted in August 2011, that legislation also included provisions to raise the nation&rsquo;s debt ceiling, and set up a process that could trigger additional spending cuts. Menendez voted against the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Act is similar to a budget resolution in terms of setting those discretionary spending limits, according to Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the legislation did not &quot;set forth projections for mandatory spending and targeted revenue levels for five years,&quot; which budget resolutions do, Peuquet told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHarvard Law School professor Howell Jackson added in an e-mail that &quot;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to consider this a substitute for the actual adoption of a budget resolution, which has lots of other implications (and procedural vehicles for getting around the filibuster).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a statement, Mike Soliman, Menendez&rsquo;s campaign manager, argued that Menendez didn&rsquo;t say the Senate passed a budget resolution, but that it passed a budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Budget Control Act is stronger than a budget resolution because it actually has the force of law,&quot; Soliman added. &quot;The Budget Control Act carries the force of law, it sets our spending limits for two years, and it actually dictates our nation&#39;s spending. A non-binding budget resolution does not.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring last week&rsquo;s debate, Menendez claimed Kyrillos&rsquo; statement was wrong and that the Senate has passed &quot;a budget&quot; in the last three years, &quot;called the Budget Control Act.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat Act set limits on discretionary spending, but it is missing other features of a &quot;budget resolution,&quot; which is considered a budget plan under the official congressional budget process. The Senate hasn&rsquo;t passed such a plan in more than three years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/politifact_nj_sen_robert_menen_1.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-12T13:36:28.626551", "ruling_date": "2012-10-14T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Sen.
