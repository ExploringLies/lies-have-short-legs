Using the same measure, imports fell to 49.3 percent of what the U.S. consumed in 2010 (as a yearly average); down from 51.5 percent in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe net import percentage hasn&#39;t been that low since 1997, when it was 49.3 percent. It peaked in 2005 at 60.3 percent and has steadily decreased every year since.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo by that measure, Obama&#39;s figures are correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the fact is that the U.S. doesn&#39;t use all of the oil it produces. Some of it is exported. Ultimately, the oil goes where suppliers can make the most profit on it, EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking strictly at the petroleum consumed by the U.S. last year, 61.2 percent of it was imported, according to <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/emeu/mer/pdf/pages/sec3_7.pdf\" id=\"gs93\" title=\"EIA data\">EIA data</a>. That percentage has been declining for years, but it is nonetheless much higher than the &quot;less than half&quot; figure cited by Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIncidentally, many may find the sources of imported oil surprising. Slightly over half comes from the Western Hemisphere. The largest share of imports came from Canada (23 percent);&nbsp; followed by Venezuela (11 percent), Saudi Arabia, (10 percent), Mexico (9 percent) and Nigeria (8.3 percent). In 2009, 17 percent of the U.S.&#39;s oil imports came from the Persian Gulf.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut again, Obama&#39;s statistic depends on the way you calculate it. By a mainstream measure of &quot;dependence on foreign oil,&quot; the U.S. produced domestically a quantity of petroleum that was slightly more than half the amount it consumed. But strictly speaking, imports made up 61 percent of the oil actually consumed in the U.S. last year. And so we rate Obama&#39;s statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-14T17:15:51.194000", "ruling_date": "2011-03-15T11:23:16", "ruling_headline": "President Obama says that for the first time in more than a decade, oil imports accounted for less than half of what the U.S. consumed", "ruling_headline_slug": "president-obama-says-first-time-more-decade-oil-im", "ruling_link_text": "Do you factor in oil exports or not?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWhite House website, Transcript: <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/11/news-conference-president\" id=\"eif5\" title=\"News conference by President Obama\">News conference by President Obama</a>, March 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, Monthly Energy Review, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/emeu/mer/pdf/pages/sec3_7.pdf\" id=\"uqjm\" title=\"Petroleum Trade: Overview\">Petroleum Trade: Overview</a> (Table 3.3a)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/energy_in_brief/foreign_oil_dependence.cfm\" id=\"zqbz\" title=\"&quot;How dependent are we on foreign oil?&quot;\">&quot;How dependent are we on foreign oil?&quot;</a> Nov. 29, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the Energy Information Administration, March 14, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of (the oil) we consumed.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a press conference", "statement_date": "2011-03-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 155, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/155/", "subject": "Oil Spill", "subject_slug": "oil-spill", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 143, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/143/", "subject": "Trade", "subject_slug": "trade", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
