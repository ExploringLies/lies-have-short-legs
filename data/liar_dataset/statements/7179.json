So 400,000 middle-class families seemed like a high number to us. We decided to check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe latest data from the Census Bureau says there are 412,259 households in Rhode Island, but only 256,181 households with families. The rest are non-family households, mostly people living alone. That&#39;s a huge difference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(There&#39;s an identical problem with the national numbers the Obama administration is using. The White House says 114 million middle-class families across the United States would be affected. The number of families is actually 76 million.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second problem: Not all Rhode Island&rsquo;s 256,000 families are middle-class families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/12poverty.shtml\">federal poverty level</a> is about $15,000 a year for a family of two. According to the latest census income data from 2011, 8.4 percent of Rhode Island families -- about 21,500 -- had an income of less than $15,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSubtract that number from 256,000 and you get about 234,500 families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(If you do the same calculation on a national level, the 114 million middle-class families that the White House talks about is really fewer than 70 million families.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother complication: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/30/barack-obama/are-you-middle-class/\">There is no official definition of middle class</a>. People in a wide range of income levels consider themselves to be there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Everybody thinks he&#39;s middle class,&quot; said Nick Kasprak, an analyst with The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. Kasprak said the category is meaningless.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, Kasprak said, everyone who already pays taxes will be in the same boat if a deal isn&#39;t reached, whether they would be considered middle class or not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The only people who are unaffected by the fiscal cliff are the people that don&rsquo;t file a tax return,&quot; Kasprak said in an e-mail. Tax increases &quot;hit pretty much everyone&quot; who files. &quot;If you pay taxes at all, they will go up &ndash; there&rsquo;s no cutoff line.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted the White House to ask about its numbers, but no one would talk to us for the record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn summary, the Obama administration is taking the number of households in the United States -- and Rhode Island -- and inaccurately categorizing them as middle-class families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s no need to exaggerate the numbers. Without an agreement on tax reform, a lot of people are going to be affected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut saying that the number of middle-class Rhode Island families to be affected is 400,000 is a substantial exaggeration. We rate Mr. Obama&#39;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(With staff reports from Paul Edward Parker and Philip Marcelo.
