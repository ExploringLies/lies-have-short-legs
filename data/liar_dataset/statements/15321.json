And there&rsquo;s no evidence that barrels and boxes were involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the White House and will add their response when it arrives.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The $150 billion</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2015 agreement freed up Iranian assets that had been frozen under sanctions. Called the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/\">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal included </a>Iran and the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agreement only affected sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear program. Iran has other assets that remain frozen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://trott.house.gov/Iran\">Some</a> conservatives have put the amount released after lifted sanctions as high as $150 billion, which is the highest of estimates we have seen. Another <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/irans-frozen-funds-how-much-is-really-there-and-how-will-they-be-used-45913\">estimate</a> from <a href=\"http://old.alef.ir/vdcftjd01w6dcxa.igiw.html?284059\">Iran&rsquo;s Central Bank</a> topped out at about $29 billion in readily available funds, with another $45 billion tied up in Chinese investment projects and the foreign assets of the Iran&rsquo;s Oil Ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After talking with officials at Iran&rsquo;s Central Bank, Nader Habibi, professor of economics of the Middle East at Brandeis University, believes the actual total is between $25 billion and $50 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">July 2015</a>, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told lawmakers Iran would gain access to $56 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to know that little of that money was under the control of the United States or any U.S. bank. Most of it, Habibi said, was in central and commercial banks overseas. Furthermore, it was Iran&rsquo;s money to begin with, not a payment from any government to buy Iran&rsquo;s cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The $1.8 billion</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, reviewed this cash transfer in a <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS20871.pdf\">2018 report</a>. It gave a total of $1.7 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, and it was never delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 1990, there were $400 million in that account. Negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount, which is a lot of money &mdash; but 25 years is a long time for interest to build up the balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States sent the money to Iran in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies. Trump embellished when he mentioned barrels and boxes. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-iran-payment-cash-20160907-snap-story.html\">Reports at the time</a> said the money was packed and loaded onto pallets, similar to how other bulk goods are shipped.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that the nuclear deal with Iran gave the country $150 billion, including $1.8 billion from the United States in cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $150 billion is the highest estimate we&#39;ve seen, and the one with the least evidence to support it. The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believe the number could be lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion. However, there&rsquo;s no evidence that barrels and boxes were involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-27T10:35:36.105638", "ruling_date": "2018-04-27T10:49:15", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says Iran got $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash.
