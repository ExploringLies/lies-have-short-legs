This is the number that&rsquo;s used to calculate the official unemployment rate, which during that month was 8.5 percent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut 13.1 million is only about half of what Romney claimed. What&rsquo;s going on?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the explanation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome critics have long argued that the BLS definition of unemployment is too limiting, since it doesn&rsquo;t count people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they&rsquo;d prefer a full-time job. So BLS also offers an alternative measure (known to economists as &quot;U-6&quot;) that factors in both groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUsing this measure, BLS in December 2011 found an additional 2.6 million Americans who are &quot;marginally attached&quot; to the labor force, meaning they&rsquo;d be ready to work if a job became available, and another 8.1 million Americans who are working part time but who would prefer a full-time job.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTogether, these three categories added up to 23.8 million people in September 2011, for a total &quot;U-6&quot; rate of 15.2 percent, or well above the official unemployment rate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Romney is a little high for the broader statistic -- 25 million as opposed to 23.8 million -- but he&rsquo;s in the ballpark. The question is whether it&rsquo;s fair to describe these roughly 25 million people as &quot;out of work.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo make the definition work, you have to include the 8.1 million Americans who are &quot;working only part-time for economic reasons.&quot; These people would certainly rather have a full-time job. However, we don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s accurate to describe them as &quot;out of work.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the U-6 measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the United States, it&rsquo;s a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others. However, Romney&rsquo;s use of the term &quot;out of work&quot; seems to be a stretch when about one-third of the &quot;25 million Americans out of work&quot; are actually working part-time. On balance, we rate the&nbsp;statement Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-23T23:47:24.206718", "ruling_date": "2012-01-23T23:54:33", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney says there are \u201c25 million Americans out of work\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-says-there-are-25-million-americans-ou", "ruling_link_text": "A broader number than the official unemployment level", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMitt Romney, transcript of the Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Jan. 23, 2012 (accessed via CQ; subscribers only)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ln\">Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey</a>,&quot; accessed Jan. 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/11/occupied-wall-street-journal/are-statistics-occupied-wall-street-journal-correc/\">Are statistics in the Occupied Wall Street Journal correct?,&quot;</a>&nbsp;Oct. 11, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;We have 25 million Americans out of work.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Republican presidential debate in Tampa", "statement_date": "2012-01-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
