But by definition, few is a <a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/few\">small</a> <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/few\">number</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&quot;Immigration as a share of national population&quot; does not distinguish between illegal immigration, his campaign cornerstone, or legal immigration. So our check will include all foreign-born immigrants, living here legally and illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&quot;Break all historical records&quot; dates back to 1890, the year to beat. That&rsquo;s the year when <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0081/twps0081.html\">14.77 percent</a> of the country&rsquo;s nearly <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts/1890_fast_facts.html\">63 million</a> population was foreign born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign sent us a September 2015 <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/28/us-foreign-born-population-nears-high/72814674/\"><em>USA Today</em> article</a> that said a new record would be set in 2025 as the share of the foreign-born population reaches 14.9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article is based on a <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/2015/09/2015-09-28_modern-immigration-wave_REPORT.pdf\">report</a> from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, noting a &quot;rapid growth&quot; of the foreign-born share from 4.7 percent in 1970 to 13.1 percent in 2013, and &quot;approaching a historic high.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With our data, we could approximate that it would be some time in 2024 or 2025,&quot; Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with Pew Research Center, told PolitiFact. &quot;But our projections definitely support the idea of 2025 exceeding the historic high.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s assuming that immigration between 2020-25 will exceed current pace&nbsp;by about 20 percent to 25 percent, Passel said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At current levels of immigration, reaching the high would take a few additional years,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Census projections</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau didn&rsquo;t start asking people where they were born until 1850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1850 to 1930, large-scale immigration from Europe contributed to an increase of the foreign-born population in the United States. Now, the majority of the foreign-born population is from Latin America and Asia, according to the bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &quot;native-born&quot; resident refers to anyone who is a U.S. citizen at birth, including people born in territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam, as well as people born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2015 the bureau released <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p25-1143.pdf\">projections on the size and composition</a> of the U.S. population. They are based on assumptions about future births, deaths and net international migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2020, 14.3 percent of a total 334.5 million people will be foreign-born, the bureau forecasts. That&rsquo;s close to the 1890 record of 14.77 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau estimated increases per decade up to 2060, when 18.8 percent of the 416.8 million population is expected to be foreign-born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But more detailed, year-by-year census data is also available based on 2014 projections (<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/population/projections/data/national/2014/summarytables.html\">table 2</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2023, 14.79 percent of the population is forecast to be foreign-born -- that&rsquo;s below the 14.8 percent usually rounded and referenced by Census as the record, but slightly above the actual 1890 figure, 14.77.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2024, the foreign-born share is projected to be 14.94, definitely surpassing the record, per Census estimates. By 2025, the estimated share is 15.09 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><script id=\"infogram_0__/d5wiTV9JYpaoykGMMKJ0\" title=\"Foreign born population share\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?3ra\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By these yearly measures, Trump&rsquo;s statement is correct, said Steven Camarota, director of research for Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The key thing is that the population is not stable, it keeps going up, unless there is a policy change,&quot; said Camarota, who co-wrote a <a href=\"http://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/immigration-population-highest_0.pdf\">report</a> on the Census projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historic data and projections suggest the foreign-born population is rising. A new record could be reached in about seven years, according to Census Bureau estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts also say projections are based assuming future immigration exceeds current pace.&nbsp;At current levels, it may take longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump didn&rsquo;t specify in how many years the record would be broken, but data points to a probable new record in fewer than 10 years.
