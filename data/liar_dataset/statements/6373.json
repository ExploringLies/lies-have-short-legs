(It will begin airing Aug. 4.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I have a problem with almost every aspect of (Obamacare),&quot; said one of the candidates, Michael Riley. He said it would create too many new agencies and &quot;we also have skyrocketing health-care costs, even in the first two years of implementation. The CBO has already doubled its estimate for the cost (of Obamacare) so far, from roughly $800 billion to $1.7 trillion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO is the Congressional Budget Office, the widely respected nonpartisan agency that generates estimates and reports about the effect that proposed laws will likely have on the federal budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Riley&rsquo;s campaign for his backup and, while we waited for their response, began our own research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has checked similar claims and found them, to be kind, less than factual.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO&#39;s <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12033/12-23-selectedhealthcarepublications.pdf\">initial estimate on March 2010</a> was that the gross cost from 2012 to 2019 would be $931 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIts <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43080\">newer estimate</a> from March 2012 put the gross cost at $1,762 billion, which is where the complaints about doubling originated. But that was for a different time frame -- from 2012 to 2022.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/21/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-health-reforms-price-tag-has-doubled/\">found</a> that if you compare the CBO figures for 2012-2019, a period covered by both reports, the estimate of the gross cost hadn&#39;t doubled, as Riley claimed. It had risen 8.6 percent, from $931 billion to $1.01 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $1.7 trillion figure was so widely misused, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43104\">the CBO issued a statement</a> saying that its estimates had not shifted significantly. &quot;The projections for each given year have changed little, on net, since March 2010,&quot; the statement said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut wait, as they say in the commercials, there&#39;s more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $1.7 trillion estimate doesn&#39;t include money saved from spending cuts, revenue from new taxes on the wealthy, penalties paid by individuals and workers who decide not to buy insurance, and other cost-saving measures included in the law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the CBO took all of that into account, which it did in <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12119/03-30-healthcarelegislation.pdf\">a 2010 report</a>, it concluded that the health-care law would actually save money, lowering the deficit by about $132 billion between 2012-2019.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a 2011 update, it found that the projected deficit reduction had slipped to $119 billion, but it was still a net savings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn July, before Riley made his statement, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43472-07-24-2012-CoverageEstimates.pdf\">the CBO updated some of its estimates</a> in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court&#39;s decision to uphold most of the 2010 law. The CBO said the cost would be lower still, although the new projected savings would come from the fact that several states have vowed not to expand the eligibility requirements for Medicaid to help more uninsured people, invoking an exemption opened up by the Supreme Court ruling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the same time, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43473\">the CBO estimated</a> that if the Affordable Care Act were to be repealed, that would <em>add</em> $109 billion to federal budget deficits from 2013 to 2022.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRiley responded to our question by sending us a handful of links, most of them editorials from the conservative Washington Examiner that compared estimates from different time frames or disputed Obamacare supporters who say the cost estimates haven&rsquo;t doubled. None mention the CBO&#39;s statement saying that the cost estimates have not changed appreciably over time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional candidate Michael Riley said the Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s estimate of the cost of Obamacare has doubled.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO itself says that&#39;s not true and that its estimates, on a year-by-year basis, have not changed significantly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurthermore, the numbers cited by Riley are misleading because they represent only the gross costs of the health care law, not any savings. According to the CBO, the savings will actually reduce the deficit, although that estimate hasn&rsquo;t been updated in two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInformation debunking similar claims has been available for the last four months <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/03/health-care-costs-didnt-double/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/no-the-cbo-hasnt-doubled-its-cost-estimate-for-health-care-reform/2011/08/25/gIQAZj7FPS_blog.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/21/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-health-reforms-price-tag-has-doubled/\">here</a> and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/tv-ad-says-health-laws-cost-2-trillion-double-what/\">here</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
