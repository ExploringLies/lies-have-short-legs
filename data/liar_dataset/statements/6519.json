School districts often boast about having low ratios, which presumably gives teachers more time to focus on each student.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEducation Week, a well-respected independent journal, <a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/class-size/\">reports that</a> most research supports the idea that small classes have benefits for students but that the smaller classes do not not automatically translate into better learning.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere does Romney stand on this? We decided to check his record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What he said</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Washington Times</em> story cited in the ad was about Romney&#39;s May visit to a Philadelphia charter school. He <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPj7bIGyzs8\">joined a roundtable</a> of teachers and talked about his approach to education while governor of Massachusetts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I came into office and talked to people, and said &lsquo;What do we do to improve our schools?&rsquo; And a number of folks said, &lsquo;Well, we need smaller classroom sizes -- that will make the biggest difference.&rsquo; So I gathered information across our state. We had 351 cities and towns. I said let&rsquo;s compare the average classroom size from each school district with the performance of our students, because we test our kids, and we&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s a relationship. And there was not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As a matter of fact, the school district with the smallest classrooms, Cambridge, had students in the bottom 10 percent,&quot; he continued. &quot;So just getting smaller classrooms didn&rsquo;t seem to be the key.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA teacher asked Romney for his views on class size.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe mentioned work by the consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute comparing class size and student performance among several countries. Romney said the study found that &quot;in schools that are the highest-performing in the world, their classroom sizes are about the same as in the United States. So it&rsquo;s not the classroom size that&rsquo;s driving the success of those school systems.&quot; He said factors such as parent involvement, motivated teachers and quality administrators were better drivers of success.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney often cites McKinsey&#39;s research. His campaign pointed us to similar remarks Romney made in Orlando last September and in Nashua, N.H. in November.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I plotted the one versus the other, classroom size against student performance. And guess what? There was no relationship at all,&quot; he said in Orlando.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign also cited his speech in The Villages, a retirement town in central Florida. Romney said Massachusetts data &quot;showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, on page 216 of his book <em>No Apology</em>, Romney wrote, &quot;in the United States, then, the effort to reduce classroom size may actually hurt education more than it helps.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s campaign website makes no mention of class size but touts the <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/education\">importance of school choice</a> and expanding access to &quot;high-quality public charter schools.&quot; His campaign spokesman, Ryan Williams, pointed out that Obama&rsquo;s education secretary, Arne Duncan, has also expressed skepticism about the emphasis on small classes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama&rsquo;s ad claims that &quot;Mitt Romney says class sizes don&rsquo;t matter.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s pretty much what he has said, saying that Massachusetts data &quot;showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-23T12:37:44.487563", "ruling_date": "2012-08-23T12:36:23", "ruling_headline": "Obama ad says class sizes 'don't matter' to Romney", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-ad-says-class-sizes-dont-matter-romney", "ruling_link_text": "Romney regularly downplays it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncjPBUW314c\">Children</a>,&quot;
