But as we found during our live fact checking of Walker&rsquo;s speech <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PolitiFactWisc?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">on Twitter</a>, the governor made some statements that could benefit from clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said more people were employed in Wisconsin in 2016 than at any time in history. When that same claim was made in June 2016 it rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-right-there-are-more-people-working-e/?hootPostID=cd9ea6d70ca4634abac76b5dde1580b4\">Mostly True</a>. But we pointed out economists generally prefer the unemployment rate, which accounts for population growth over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s speech also touted listening sessions he has held throughout the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as we found in checking an August 2016 claim by a potential 2018 gubernatorial candidate, Democratic state Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/dana-wachs/\">Dana Wachs</a> of Eau Claire, Walker&rsquo;s sessions were <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/24/dana-wachs/general-public-and-press-not-allowed-attend-gov-sc/?hootPostID=3ade9b5ba764cfff003775bfcbed0578\">&quot;invite-only and excluding the press.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>World War II times</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Walker&rsquo;s statement on property taxes, the governor&rsquo;s office pointed to a <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0716wistax.pdf\">July 2015 memo</a> from the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayer Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memo stated that Wisconsin&rsquo;s property tax burden was at 3.6 percent of personal income, the lowest since 1946 (when it was also 3.6 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dale Knapp, the alliance&rsquo;s research director, gave us the raw numbers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The levy was $9.45 billion in 2015 on property taxes payable in 2016. That figure amounts to 3.6 percent of total personal income of $263.3 billion in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knapp told us comparing property taxes to income is one way to see how much of a take property taxes have on the state&rsquo;s economy. He said the memo reflects the most recent figures available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A note: In a January 2017 report, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau measured property taxes versus income at 10 intervals dating back to 1970. Wisconsin&rsquo;s property tax level per $1,000 of personal income exceeded the national average during each period and ranked 12th nationally in 2014, the latest year covered in the report.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, didn&rsquo;t dispute the taxpayer alliance&rsquo;s 3.6 percent figure. But she told us one thing to note is that some people haven&rsquo;t benefited as much from Walker&rsquo;s property tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Walker&rsquo;s 2011-&rsquo;13 state budget <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/117501518.html\">stopped inflation adjustments</a> for the state <a href=\"https://www.revenue.wi.gov/Pages/FAQS/ise-homedef.aspx#home1\">Homestead Credit</a>, which softens the impact of property taxes and rent on persons with lower incomes. The program can put <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/10/gwen-moore/rep-gwen-moore-says-gov-scott-walker-gutted-tax-cr/\">more than $1,100</a> back in people&rsquo;s pockets through income tax refunds. For 2016, people with a household income of <a href=\"https://www.revenue.wi.gov/Pages/FAQS/ise-home.aspx\">less than $24,680</a> could qualify for the credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornelius cited figures from the state fiscal bureau showing that the credits have been reduced by $133.5 million since Walker ended the inflation adjustments. That means the money stayed in state coffers rather than being refunded to residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office of state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, also pointed to Walker&#39;s budget moves, including limits on how much school districts can levy in property taxes,&nbsp;in noting that&nbsp;more than half of Wisconsin&#39;s 424 school districts have <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/education/2016/11/10/most-school-spending-referendums-pass/93565802/\">passed referendum initiatives</a> since the beginning of 2012.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, &quot;are the lowest that they&#39;ve been since the end of World War II.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that one change Walker made reduces income tax refunds given to lower-income taxpayers through the state Homestead Credit, which is aimed at softening the impact of property taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But an analysis by the respected Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance shows that on the measure Walker cited, property taxes are the lowest they have been since 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-12T12:12:35.461024", "ruling_date": "2017-01-13T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says Wisconsin property taxes, as percentage of income, are lowest since end of WWII", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-wisconsin-property-taxes-percent", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, though some taxpayers benefiting less", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Office of the governor, <a href=\"https://walker.wi.gov/wiworking\">video</a> (14:15) of Gov.
