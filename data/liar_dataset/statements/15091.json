Michael Williams received some on-air fact-checking from CNN when he criticized Delta Air Lines for ending a discount partnership with the National Rifle Association while favoring &quot;liberal-leaning organizations&quot; such as Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delta <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/article/2018/mar/01/does-casey-cagles-tweet-delta-suggest-constitution/\">ended a discount agreement</a> with the NRA in order to remain &quot;neutral&quot; in the national debate over gun control, which resurfaced after a Feb. 14 mass shooting in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If they&#39;re going to pull the discount for NRA members, why not pull it for Planned Parenthood or some of the left organizations out there?&quot; Williams, R-Cumming, claimed during a Feb. 27 <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1802/27/cnr.07.html\">interview</a> with CNN&rsquo;s Brianna Keilar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keilar asked for his source of information to back up Delta discounts for Planned Parenthood. Williams said he and other state senators &quot;looked it up on Google.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just to be clear, no, we looked it up as well. And it doesn&#39;t appear, after some digging, that we have been able to determine that that is actually factual, because you&#39;re indicating something that may not be true there,&quot; Keilar responded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams, who&rsquo;s running to become Georgia&rsquo;s governor, said he &quot;very firmly&quot; believed that Delta &quot;is out there giving discounts to left-leaning organizations as well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But if you&#39;re making that argument,&quot; Keilar said, &quot;shouldn&#39;t you have your facts straight?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like CNN, PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence to support Williams&rsquo; claim. Williams&rsquo; campaign did not provide evidence to prove it, and Planned Parenthood told us there are no perks, discounts or deals that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member &mdash; whether with Delta or any other company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are no corporate perks that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member,&quot; said Erica Sackin, director of political communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delta did not respond to our query.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Williams&rsquo; evidence is a missed connection</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams and Keilar&rsquo;s debate continued off-air on Twitter: Keilar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brikeilarcnn/status/968665146213240832\">asked for backup</a> on the Planned Parenthood claim. Williams <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsforga/status/968858185527414784\">tweeted back</a> that his team had responded. Keilar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brikeilarcnn/status/968962911782785024\">said</a> his statement still did not back up his &quot;bogus claim.&quot; Williams ultimately <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsforga/status/968956582888394753\">tweeted a statement </a>saying Keilar was pushing a &quot;false narrative.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams&rsquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsforga/status/968956582888394753\">statement</a> mentioned &quot;Delta&#39;s history of supporting left-wing organizations that donate to abortion provider Planned Parenthood.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a few steps removed from what he said in the interview about Planned Parenthood receiving the discount itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams started to backtrack from that in the Keilar interview. Here&rsquo;s a transcript of the original exchange on CNN:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Williams: &quot;You&#39;re telling me that Delta &hellip; is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations? Is that what you&#39;re telling me?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Keilar: &quot;No, you told me that it was Planned Parenthood. I&#39;m just talking to you about what you said to me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Williams: &quot;I know, but is that not a left-wing organization? ... It is a very left-leaning organization.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Keilar: &quot;There&#39;s no indication they are giving discounts to that organization, is my point.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Williams: &quot;Again, let&#39;s, I guess, agree to disagree, because, again, we cannot -- bring me back on and I will have the information for you about where they&#39;re giving away these discounts to (a) left-leaning organization&nbsp;that support(s) Planned Parenthood.&quot;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in addition to Williams saying Delta gives discounts to Planned Parenthood, he backs it up to say Delta has ties with left-leaning groups that in turn support Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions. That doesn&rsquo;t check out either.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Faulty Komen link</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams&rsquo; spin that Delta has ties to the Susan. G. Komen Foundation, which supports Planned Parenthood, is also wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A quick Google search reveals Planned Parenthood receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from Delta partner Susan G. Komen,&quot; Williams said in his printed statement. &quot;It&#39;s as simple as that. Has Delta cut their ties with the Susan G. Komen Foundation like they did the NRA?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrea Rader, spokeswoman for the breast cancer research organization Susan G. Komen, told PolitiFact Georgia, &quot;Komen does not and has not had a partnership with Delta at either the state or national level.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Komen does have seven grants in local markets to Planned Parenthood, totaling $277,000, for breast exam services, Rader said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams may have conflated Susan G. Komen with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.bcrf.org/partners/corporate/delta-air-lines\">an actual</a> <a href=\"https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/about-delta/corporate-responsibility/force-for-global-good/breast-cancer-research-foundation.html\">Delta partner</a>. The&nbsp;Breast Cancer Research Foundation told PolitiFact Georgia it does not give money to Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg Bluestein, a political reporter for the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bluestein/status/969289455629684737\">tweeted</a> to Williams that Komen said his claim about a Delta partnership is incorrect. Williams <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsforga/status/969292214672285697\">tweeted</a> back, &quot;They may want to issue a new statement&quot; and included a <a href=\"https://flashpointagency.com/portfolio/delta-airlines-pink-plane/\">link</a> to a website for Flashpoint Agency, billed as a marketing agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flashpoint Agency&rsquo; page has photos of a white and pink plane with a pink ribbon that appears to be Breast Cancer Research Foundation&rsquo;s logo. &quot;As part of Delta&rsquo;s work with the Susan G Komen Foundation Flashpoint was brought in to help launch the &lsquo;Pink Plane&rsquo; for Breast Cancer Awareness,&quot; the website said, incorrectly identifying the partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7zwu77/delta_ends_nra_discounts_keeps_relationship_with/?st=je8o7fon&amp;sh=c4378c88\">Reddit post</a> where a user wrote &quot;Delta ends NRA discounts. Keeps relationship with Planned Parenthood.&quot; The user included a screenshot of a Twitter exchange <a href=\"https://twitter.com/badgerfan82/status/967394931055779842\">asking</a> Delta, &quot;Did you end your discount for Planned Parenthood?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Delta Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Delta/status/967397444802588673\">responded</a>, &quot;Hey Stuart.

We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams said Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence that supports Williams&rsquo; claim.
