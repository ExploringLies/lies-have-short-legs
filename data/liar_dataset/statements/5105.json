Rick Scott finds it hard to pass over a good doughnut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOr a doughnut story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott started his career running a pair of doughnut shops in Kansas City in the 1970s. He returned to his doughnut roots in 2011, spending a day working at <a href=\"http://www.nicolasdonuts.com/\">Nicola&rsquo;s Donuts</a> in Tampa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a black hat that he clearly didn&rsquo;t like wearing and a matching black shirt, Gov. Scott baked and then sold fried pastries by the dozen to customers. You can read all about his day, the first of <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/article1183992.ece\">Scott&rsquo;s &quot;Let&rsquo;s Get to Work Days&quot;, here.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOr you can just listen to Scott tell the story himself -- which he did during his second State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012. With owner Rachel Waatti listening on from the House chambers, Scott went on about doughnuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe joked about how you don&rsquo;t have to worry about employees eating too many doughnuts (they&rsquo;re just too rich) and how Waatti complained that Scott was spending too much time with the media and not enough time working.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe then touted the accomplishments of his day back in the doughnut business.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We sold out; more than 240 dozen by 8:30 a.m.,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYour humble fact-checker happened to be tailing Scott that day and can report, the doughnut man-turned-governor is creating a bit of doughnut lore.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe doors to Nicola&rsquo;s opened at 6 a.m. and doughnuts were being snatched off the shelves (Your fact-checker knows, because he purchased a dozen himself to share with his hungry colleagues.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy 8:30 a.m., the store had already run out of doughnuts and had to grab another 15-or-so dozen doughnuts from Nicola&rsquo;s second location.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow many doughnuts were sold by the time Scott left?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWaatti and workers told PolitiFact Florida the number was definitely above the 65 dozen they originally baked for the shop and was probably around 80 dozen. <a href=\"http://www.thecaloriecounter.com/Foods/1800/18255/9/Food.aspx\">That&rsquo;s probably at least 240,000 calories of breakfast</a>, but it&rsquo;s not the &quot;more than 240 dozen&quot; Scott bragged to legislators about.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShortly after Scott&rsquo;s speech, Waatti spoke to David DeCamp of the<em> Tampa Bay Times</em>. She said the 240-dozen figure includes all of the doughnuts sold at both Nicola&rsquo;s locations throughout the entire day Scott worked at the bakery. But she also reconfirmed that the shop Scott worked at sold about 80 dozen while he was there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt PolitiFact Florida, we&rsquo;re almost as serious about our doughnuts as we are our fact-checks. We rate Scott&rsquo;s &quot;240 dozen&quot; claim Mostly False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow can somebody pass a maple glazed?</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-10T13:35:07.794410", "ruling_date": "2012-01-10T13:59:46", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott talks doughnuts in 2012 State of the State address", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-talks-doughnuts-2012-state-state-addres", "ruling_link_text": "That's a lot of sugar", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGov.
