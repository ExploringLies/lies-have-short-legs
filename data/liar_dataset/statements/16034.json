And in September 2018, he said he would <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/wisconsin/articles/2018-09-14/the-latest-kleefisch-evers-clash-over-health-insurance\">call a special session</a> of the Legislature to adopt that measure if the Affordable Care Act were blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/10/16/senate-leader-doesnt-know-if-theres-enough-gop-support-pass-pre-existing-conditions-school-funding-p/1661100002/\">The prospects</a> for such a bill passing, however, are unclear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Walker has provided few details on what he has in mind, raising questions about how people with pre-existing conditions would be covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel examined what would happen to people in Wisconsin with pre-existing conditions if Obamacare were overturned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/health-care/2018/09/20/walker-gives-no-detail-how-state-would-ensure-pre-existing-coverage/1352512002/\">the fates of some them are uncertain</a>. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover specific health benefits, including prescription drugs for almost every medical condition. So, without a similar requirement in state law, insurers could sidestep any requirement that they cover pre-existing health conditions. They could do this by not including some services or costly drugs in a health plan&#39;s benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that before Obamacare, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/08/tammy-baldwin/does-leah-vukmir-support-letting-insurers-deny-cov/\">Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool</a> was held up as something as a model on pre-existing conditions, at least for the people it covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it worked only for people who could afford the insurance in the first place &nbsp;&mdash; and many people with pre-existing conditions could not afford coverage from the high-risk pool, as it covered fewer than 25,000 people. An estimated 852,000 people in Wisconsin have a health condition that would have led to being denied coverage in the market for health insurance sold directly to individuals and families before the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers says Walker supports &quot;a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker has supported two efforts that would result in elimination of blanket protections for pre-existing conditions: Legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and a lawsuit that would block it. The law provides a variety of protections to people with pre-existing medical conditions &mdash; including prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to those people and prohibiting them from charging those people higher rates. So, getting rid of Obamacare would eliminate those protections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker has pledged that if Obamacare is repealed, he would seek legislation to guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But it&rsquo;s not clear how that legislation would compare to Obamacare and not clear if it could pass the Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-18T12:40:58.467684", "ruling_date": "2018-10-18T12:47:37", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says he would cover pre-existing conditions, but backs plans that would end protections", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-he-would-cover-pre-existing-cond", "ruling_link_text": "He backs Obamacare repeal legislation and lawsuit", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email, Tony Evers campaign spokesman Sam Lau, Oct. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Scott Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg, Oct. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart, <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/08/30/exclusive-gov-scott-walker-backs-renewed-push-to-repeal-obamacare-a-winner-all-the-way-around/\">&quot;Exclusive &mdash; Gov.
