Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a vocal advocate of tighter gun laws, called out President Donald Trump&rsquo;s pick for the Supreme Court for the nominee&rsquo;s position on the Second Amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical,&quot; Murphy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1016490627742171137\">tweeted</a> July 9. &quot;He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Kavanaugh, who will replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy if confirmed, on the issue of assault weapons indeed stands to the right of Scalia, who as a young man would <a href=\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/635187836/Young-Scalia-carried-rifle-while-riding-NY-subway.html?pg=all\">tote</a> his rifle on the New York City subway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reading the relevant court decisions, experts told us both Kavanaugh and Scalia hold that assault weapons are protected under the Second Amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assault weapons encompass a series of semi-automatic firearms, mostly rifles. Semi-automatic weapons are those where one trigger pulled equals one bullet shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The Heller case</div>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the defining cases on gun rights in recent years is <em>D.C. vs. Heller.</em> Alongside five others, Richard Heller, a special police officer for the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in 2003 challenging the constitutionality of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which restricted D.C. residents from owning handguns. The suit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Heller&rsquo;s favor. The majority decision was <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html\">written</a> by Scalia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scalia argued that handguns have not traditionally been banned and are in common use. He also pointed out, however, that the right granted by the Second Amendment &quot;is not unlimited,&quot; and upholds &quot;laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question of assault weapons never came up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, rifles came up in a later legal challenge between Heller and Washington, when Heller questioned the constitutionality of the district&rsquo;s Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, created in response to the Supreme Court decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit favored the district two to one, but Kavanaugh dissented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles,&quot; Kavanaugh wrote. &quot;Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Scalia&rsquo;s opinion</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When the question of whether assault weapons bans are unconstitutional was raised of the Supreme Court, Scalia was unable to answer because the court rejected the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case in question was<em> <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Highland-park-op-below.pdf\">Friedman vs. Highland Park</a></em>, a challenge to a Chicago suburb&rsquo;s ordinance banning semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. However, Justice Clarence Thomas voiced a similar opinion to Kavanaugh&rsquo;s in the rejection, which Scalia joined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scalia and Thomas wrote that in accepting the ban, the court was not complying with the precedent set by <em>Heller</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The city&rsquo;s ban is thus highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes,&quot; Thomas wrote. &quot;Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semi-automatic rifles. The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the <em>Highland Park </em>case, we should say Kavanaugh was on the same page as Scalia,&quot; said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy&rsquo;s office pointed out that Scalia&rsquo;s opinion explicitly allowed for regulations, which some lower courts found included assault weapons bans. But the rulings are not unanimous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have more courts upholding the bans than finding them unconstitutional, but there&rsquo;s definitely a split of opinion on this,&quot; said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the Independence Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy said that on assault weapons, Kavanaugh&rsquo;s position is &quot;way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kavanaugh stated that assault weapons bans were unconstitutional in the circuit court case <em>Heller vs. District of Columbia</em>. Scalia&rsquo;s opinion on the Supreme Court allowed for some regulations in <em>District of Columbia vs. Heller</em>, which some courts have interpreted to rule in favor of assault weapons bans. But the decision was not about assault weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found at least one instance where Scalia signed off on saying an assault weapons ban would be unconstitutional. So Kavanaugh&rsquo;s position and Scalia&rsquo;s are substantially similar. Leaving room for legal interpretation, we rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-11T10:09:37.811391", "ruling_date": "2018-07-11T11:01:04", "ruling_headline": "Is Trump's Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh to the right of Scalia on assault weapons?
