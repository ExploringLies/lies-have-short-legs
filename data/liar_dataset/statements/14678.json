Open Society Foundations from the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a fabricated tale made by a notorious fake news website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the headline, &quot;Youngest world leader bans George Soros&rsquo;s Foundations from Austria,&quot; the YourNewsWire.com post said that the made-up ban was in response to Soros&rsquo; $18 billion donation to the organization, making it the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/business/george-soros-open-society-foundations.html\">second-biggest philanthropic organization</a> in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said that Kurz gave the organization 28 days to &quot;cease and desist operations in Austria.&quot; The story falsely said the incoming chancellor called Soros &quot;the greatest challenge humanity is facing in the world in 2017.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake story goes on to quote Kurz describing&nbsp;Soros as &quot;a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming his blood funnel into anything that smells like money&quot; &mdash; language identical to a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405\">2010</a> Rolling Stone piece about Goldman Sachs by Matt Taibbi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides Soros&rsquo; massive donation and Kurz&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41627586\">young leader</a> status (he&rsquo;s 31), this story is complete bogus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Society Foundations, an organization with efforts in different countries all over the world, has <a href=\"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/offices-foundations#europe\">no offices in Austria</a> &mdash; and therefore nothing to &quot;cease and desist.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any record of Kurz describing Soros in that light or commenting on OSF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros was implicated during Kurz&rsquo;s campaign when a Facebook page called &quot;The Truth About Sebastian Kurz&quot; accused the future chancellor, who supports low levels of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/austria-immigration-sebastian-kurz/542964/\">immigration</a>, of conspiring with Soros to let in a new wave of refugees. The Facebook page was later found to be set up by a consultant working for Kurz&rsquo;s opponent, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-election-scandal-christian-kern-sebastian-kurz-haus-of-cards/\">Christian Kern</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article&rsquo;s birthplace, YourNewsWire.com, is known for producing controversial and often falsified news stories. YourNewsWire.com says it delivers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/yournewswire/about/?ref=page_internal\">&quot;the news you want and the news other people won&rsquo;t report&quot;</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim is Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-10-25T17:41:58.883070", "ruling_date": "2017-10-26T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Austria's Sebastian Kurz ban George Soros' organization?
