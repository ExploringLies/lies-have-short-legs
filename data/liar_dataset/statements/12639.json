Elizabeth Warren did not leave her signature issue behind when she became presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump&rsquo;s most pugnacious critic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Donald Trump has already offered his big wet kiss to Wall Street. He has said, &lsquo;Hey guys, if I get in, I&#39;m going to roll back all of those regulations, because it makes it too hard for banks to cheat people,&rsquo; &quot; Warren said in a June 28 interview on <em>The View</em>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump never said he wanted to make it easier for banks to cheat people, but he has said he wants to roll back regulations on Wall Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of the interview, Warren is likely referring to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act, the premier piece of legislation regulating the banking industry after the crash. Warren has been a consistent crusader for stricter regulation of the financial industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early in the campaign, Trump distinguished himself from his rivals for the Republican nomination with some tough language directed toward&nbsp;Wall Street. &quot;The hedge fund guys didn&#39;t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,&quot; Trump said in a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-august-23-2015-trump-christie-cruz/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CBS interview in August</u></a>. At <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/06/politics/donald-trump-wall-street-hedge-funds/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>other points</u></a>, he extended a similar critique to &quot;Wall Street Guys&quot; in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that hedge fund managers &quot;get away with murder,&quot; but he&rsquo;s been unclear about what he&rsquo;d do to change that. One concrete Trump proposal on Wall Street was changes to the tax code that would change tax provisions benefitting&nbsp;hedge fund managers, but because of separate tax cuts for partnerships, his tax plan actually had the effect of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/01/hillary-clinton/clinton-right-say-trumps-plan-good-hedge-funders/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>substantially improving their position</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dodd-Frank, Trump has gone on the record again and again saying that&nbsp;the law is bad news for the economy and the banking industry. He&rsquo;s called it a &quot;disaster,&quot; and a &quot;very negative force.&quot; Well before he launched his current presidential run, Trump attacked increased regulation after the financial crisis, which he said prevented loans to all but the very wealthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while it&#39;s not the same thing as a &quot;big wet kiss to Wall Street,&quot; Trump has said he expects bankers to appreciate his position. &quot;I think things have to be done with (Dodd-Frank), and I think Wall Street would like to hear that,&quot; Trump told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only bit of wiggle room here is that Trump has been inconsistent about how much of Dodd-Frank would be left when he finished with it. He has said he would &quot;get rid of it,&quot; &quot;repeal it&quot; or, almost word-for-word from Warren&rsquo;s statement, &quot;roll that back.&quot; He has also said, however, that &quot;there are some aspects you could leave,&quot; and that could be &quot;changed greatly&quot; instead of being eliminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Trump&rsquo;s most recent statement about Dodd-Frank, in a mid&nbsp;May interview with Reuters, he said he would release a plan within two weeks that would be &quot;close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A month after his Reuters interview, the plan, which would presumably settle this question, has not been released. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren said Trump wants to &quot;roll back all of those regulations&quot; on Wall Street banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we don&rsquo;t know what Trump&rsquo;s plan would look like exactly, he certainly wants to scrap a lot of the law. It might not be right to say &quot;all&quot; of those regulations, but Trump himself has been unclear on that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-05T09:45:31.704513", "ruling_date": "2016-07-05T11:25:10", "ruling_headline": "As Warren says, Trump is no fan of post-crisis Wall Street regulations", "ruling_headline_slug": "warren-says-trump-no-fan-post-crisis-wall-street-r", "ruling_link_text": "Trump primes pump for Dodd-Frank dump", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>The View</em>, <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/the-view/video/pl5554876/VDKA0_h7vj806f\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Interview With Sen.
