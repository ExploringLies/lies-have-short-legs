The Irish-American&nbsp;actress is alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from that major fact error, there are many other inaccurate points in this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The made-up story said that Ronan died following an on-set accident where she fell 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor while filming her new movie <em>Mary Queen of Scots </em>in the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we found that the film was actually <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2328900/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt\">filmed in the United Kingdom</a>, across various parts of England and Scotland, and not in St. Lucia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article fabricated quotes by British film producer and co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079677/\">Tim Bevan</a>, who is co-producing the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A coroner named Bradley Cyril is also quoted as saying Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall, passing away shortly after being placed on a ventilator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a similar Beausejour Health Centre in <a href=\"https://www.ierha.ca/default.aspx?cid=6341\">Canada</a>, but we did not find any facilities by the name of Beausejour Medical Center, and none in St. Lucia. Consequently, we couldn&rsquo;t find anyone named Bradley Cyril who works as a known coroner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also mentioned in the story are supposed injuries suffered by actress <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Charlize Theron</a>,&nbsp;the &quot;irreplaceable star&quot; for <em>Mary Queen of Scots</em>.&nbsp;Not only is Theron injury-free, she is not in the film.
