Home runs over the right-field wall would land in the Providence River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Details of the project are still emerging. On Tuesday, the new owners <a href=\"http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150224/SPORTS/150229561\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>told The Providence Journal</u></a> that they planned to build the stadium with their own money but were exploring various public-subsidy options, including asking the state to give them the land, which had &nbsp;been earmarked for a public park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the new owners, lawyer James J. Skeffington, was asked what such a public-partnership might look like in an interview Tuesday with reporter Gene Valicenti on WPRO-AM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, there&rsquo;s only 30 cities that have Triple A teams in the United States, in major league baseball. And virtually every one of them [is] playing in government owned ballparks,&quot; Skeffington said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He went on to say that such arrangements were a way for cities and towns to induce the owners of those Triple A teams to play there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Skeffington was right about the number of publicly-owned ballparks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Skeffington, who told us his information was based on a consultant&rsquo;s report that he would provide to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we called Skeffington, we contacted each of the 30 Triple A teams to find out who owns their ballpark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We learned that only three were privately owned: Security Service Field, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox&rsquo;s stadium; BB and T Ballpark, home of the Charlotte Knights; &nbsp;and Raley Field, the Sacramento River Cats&rsquo; ballpark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skeffington identified four stadiums as being privately owned, but our research concluded that one of those ballparks -- Aces Ballpark in Reno, Nev. -- is, in fact, publically owned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That park has been owned by the City Redevelopment Agency of Reno since 2013, according to Eric Edelstein, president of the Reno Aces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We note that there is much debate over whether public support for professional sport teams, such as helping to build stadiums, is a wise use of public money. That is beyond the scope of this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>James Skeffington said that &quot;virtually&quot; all of the 30 Triple A teams play in government-owned ballparks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research found that 27 of the 30 stadiums those teams play in are owned by a city, county or other government entity, as seen in Reno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We note that the word virtually is not an absolute.
