Ted Cruz is no ally of California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Cruz is hoping to paint his rival for the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump, as a political friend of Brown and two other top Democrats in the Golden State: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Kamala Harris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Here in California, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump</u></a> has given $12,000 to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/jerry-brown/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Jerry Brown</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/search/?q=gavin+newsom\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gavin Newsom</u></a> and Kamala Harris,&quot; Cruz said during his speech on April 30 at the California Republican Party Convention south of San Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz went on to tell the GOP California audience: &quot;Y&rsquo;all are experiencing first-hand the consequences of those misguided liberal policies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Cruz&rsquo;s claim about Trump funding three top California Democrats was correct? And if so, how recently had Trump helped out these Democrats?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out, Cruz&rsquo;s claim is accurate, based on campaign finance data on the California Secretary of State&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://powersearch.sos.ca.gov/advanced.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>website</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump&rsquo;s donations to the Democrats aren&rsquo;t recent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP frontrunner contributed $3,500 to Brown&rsquo;s run for state attorney general, making donations in 2004 and 2006. He gave $2,500 to Newsom&rsquo;s 2009 truncated run for governor. And he chipped in a total of $6,000 to Harris in 2011 and 2013 for her successful re-election campaign for attorney general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/6716134/Donald%20Trump's%20CA%20contributions.JPG\" style=\"height:644px; width:1410px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: California Secretary of State&#39;s website</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has acknowledged financing both Republicans and Democrats during his long business career, all to gain political influence. Records show he gave $25,000 to the California Republican Party in 2005 and $12,000 to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state&rsquo;s former Republican governor, a couple years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Cruz doesn&rsquo;t mention about Trump&rsquo;s donations to the Democrats is that they took place before Trump&rsquo;s run for the GOP presidential nomination. A Cruz campaign press release included a timeline for the donations, but we are fact-checking what Cruz said during his speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ted Cruz said Donald Trump gave $12,000 to three top California Democrats, including Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign finance data show Cruz&rsquo;s claim is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Cruz leaves out the fact that the donations to the California governor took place a decade ago, before the Democrat ran for re-election to the state&rsquo;s top office. Trump&rsquo;s contributions to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>--------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE</em></strong> <em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> more </a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-03T15:10:57.750498", "ruling_date": "2016-05-03T12:30:05", "ruling_headline": "Yep, Donald Trump gave $12K to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom & Kamala Harris", "ruling_headline_slug": "yep-donald-trump-gave-12k-jerry-brown-gavin-newsom", "ruling_link_text": "Claim is accurate, but omits when donations took place", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ted Cruz, speech at California Republican Party Convention, April 30, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://powersearch.sos.ca.gov/quick-search.php\">Power Search Campaign Finance</a>, accessed April 30, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 43, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 38, "first_name": "Ted", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1475, "last_name": "Cruz", "mostly_true_count": 22, "name_slug": "ted-cruz", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/CRUZPFTNEW.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1475/", "total_count": 141, "true_count": 7, "website": "http://www.tedcruz.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Here in California, Donald Trump has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at the California Republican Party Convention", "statement_date": "2016-04-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
