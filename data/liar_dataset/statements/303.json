Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton argued about Obama's recent comments about Ronald Reagan (We addressed the Reagan spat with\n<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/301/\">\n this item\n</a>\n). As the debate grew heated, Obama portrayed himself as a fighter for Democratic principles and suggested that he was more in touch with working people than she was.\n<p>\n \"While I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart,\" Obama said.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama is referring to the period from 1985 to 1988 when he was a community organizer in neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side. And he is correct that during that period, many employers in that area &mdash; particularly in the steel industry &mdash; were closing their plants and moving jobs overseas. U.S. Steel, for example, employed 40,000 people there in the 1970s but shut down operations in the mid 1980s.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama is correct about Clinton's tenure on the Wal-Mart board of directors. She was appointed to the  board in 1986 when her husband was the governor of Arkansas and she served until 1992. As a board member, Clinton pushed for more women in management and a better environmental program, according to a\n <i>\n  New York Times\n </i>\n examination of her work on the board.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the time, she worked as an attorney for the Rose Law Firm, which had many corporate clients such as Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods. Clinton specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n We find Obama has his facts straight and his claim is True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:25.764307", "ruling_date": "2008-01-22T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hillary went the Wal-Mart way", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-went-the-wal-mart-way", "ruling_link_text": "Hillary went the Wal-Mart way", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Obama Campaign, <a href+\"http://www.barackobama.com/learn/meet_barack.php\">Meet Barack Obama</a><p>\r\nEncyclopedia of Chicago, <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2882.html\"> U.S. Steel Corp.</a><p>\r\nWal-Mart, <a href=\"http://walmartstores.com/Files/1992AR.pdf\">1992 Annual Report</a><p>\r\nWal-Mart, <a href=\"http://walmartstores.com/Files/1987AR.pdf\">1987 Annual Report</a><p>\r\nEncyclopedia of Arkansas, <a href=\"http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2744\"> Hillary Clinton</a><p>\r\nNew York Times, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E2DB163AF935A15751C0A962958260\"> \"Rose Law Firm, Arkansas Power, Slips as It Steps Onto a Bigger Stage,\" </a> by Stephen Labaton, Feb. 26, 1994<p>\r\nNew York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/us/politics/20walmart.html\">As a Director, Clinton Moved Wal-Mart Board - But Only So Far,\"</a> by Michael Barbaro, May 20, 2007<p>\r\nDavid Mendell, Obama: From Promise to Power, Amistad, 2007<p>\r\nInterviews: David Mendell, author of Obama: From Promise to Power; Ed Paesel, executive director, South Suburban Mayors and Managers Associations.", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "\"While I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart.\"", "statement_context": "a debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.", "statement_date": "2008-01-21", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
