Lawmakers in support said smoking is a public health hazard and that local governments should be allowed to assert local control.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFreshman Rep. Caddy McKeown, D-Coos Bay, said she too struggled with aspects of <a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2013/HB2870/\">House Bill 2870</a>, but then reeled off some disturbing statistics courtesy of the Coos County public health department, including this one:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;A baby in Coos County is two times as likely to be born to a mother who is someone who used tobacco during her pregnancy as is the average baby born in Oregon or the U.S.,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTwice as many smokers? What&rsquo;s up, Coos County? Studies show that prenatal smoking puts babies at greater risk of low birth weight, respiratory illnesses and other potential health problems.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tState and county numbers</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcKeown&rsquo;s office shared a 2011-12 annual report on the status of public health in Coos County.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe also checked with Stephen Brown, a tobacco prevention program coordinator at Coos County. <a href=\"http://public.health.oregon.gov/BirthDeathCertificates/VitalStatistics/annualreports/CountyDataBook/cdb2011/Documents/tbl07_11.pdf\">Figures from 2011 births</a>show that in Coos County, 23.4 percent of mothers used tobacco while pregnant. Statewide, the figure was 10.7 percent. That&rsquo;s more than double.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn real numbers, that means 135 of 577 babies born in Coos County in 2011 were born to smokers. Statewide, 4,795 of 45,136 babies born in 2011 were born to smokers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBrown says that studies show that people are less likely to smoke the higher their educational attainment. Prenatal tobacco use is greater among women who don&rsquo;t finish high school than among women who graduate from college. People living in poorer households are more likely to smoke. Coos County lags the state in educational achievement and in per capita income.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCertainly Coos is not the only county to post rates at least twice Oregon&rsquo;s. Douglas and Josephine counties posted rates at 25 percent, and Lake County was the highest at 26.5 percent. Those are also rural counties similar to Coos in income and education demographics. Multnomah County was at 6.8 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNational average</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA national average is harder to come by, mainly because not all states use the same &quot;<a href=\"https://northwest-hospitals.kaiserpermanente.org/sites/default/files/content_files/documents/birthcertificate.pdf\">certificate of live birth&quot; forms </a>to collect prenatal information. The Annie E. Casey Foundation calculates a <a href=\"http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Rankings.aspx?ind=13\">U.S. figure of 9 percent </a>for births in 2010, but the number leaves out about 20 states. Oregon, which was included, was at 11 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tStill, the average is backed up by a hefty <a href=\"http://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/TobaccoPrevention/Documents/tobfacts.pdf\">Oregon Health </a><a href=\"http://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/TobaccoPrevention/Documents/tobfacts.pdf\">Authority</a>document, which reports prenatal tobacco use across the country went from 13.6 percent in 1996 to 10.7 percent in 2005. In Oregon, the percentage of women smoking during pregnancy also dropped during that period, from 17.8 percent to 12.4 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe ruling:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe can say with certainty that babies born in Coos County are twice as likely to have mothers who smoked during pregnancy than the average baby in Oregon. That also looks to be the case using older or incomplete national averages.
