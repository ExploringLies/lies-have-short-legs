Her attack was more specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shilling stated that with Trump&rsquo;s plan, &quot;the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic inequality has been a signature issue for Sanders, whose presidential campaign has kept Clinton from claiming the presumptive nominee title <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Trump</a> has on the Republican side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Sanders said in Madison that the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, we rated his claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-madison-claims-top-01-americans-hav/\">Mostly True</a> &nbsp;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s take a look at Shilling&rsquo;s one-tenth of 1 percenters claim -- which, as we&rsquo;ll see, was made at something of a moving target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standing in the lobby of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan in September 2015, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/28/donald-trump-unveils-plan-to-overhaul-tax-code-with-broad-cuts/\">rolled out</a> his <a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/trump-tax-reform.pdf\">tax reform plan</a> -- which some analysts immediately saw as a boon for the wealthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He proposed significant cuts across the board, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/apr/07/politifacts-guide-2016-candidates-tax-plans/\">PolitiFact National found</a>, but the wealthiest would get the most in tax cuts. For the highest income earners, the top income tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 25 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked about Shilling&rsquo;s claim, Clinton&rsquo;s Wisconsin campaign cited <a href=\"http://tpcprod.urban.org/UploadedPDF/2000560-an-analysis-of-donald-trumps-tax-plan.pdf\">an analysis</a> by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of two Washington, D.C. think tanks: the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The analysis found that on average, under Trump&rsquo;s plan, households at all income levels would receive tax cuts -- but the highest-income households would receive the largest cuts, both in dollars and as a percentage of income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specific to Shilling&rsquo;s claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The highest-income 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- those who had an income of over $3.7 million in 2015 -- would get an average tax cut of more than $1.3 million in 2017.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>That same group would receive 18 percent of the tax reduction, while the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would receive 16.4 percent of the reduction.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At our request, the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice also did calculations, which came out nearly the same: The top 0.1 percent would get 17 percent of Trump&#39;s proposed tax cuts and the bottom 60 percent would get 13 percent of the cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To some extent, this isn&rsquo;t a surprise, in that the wealthiest pay the lion&rsquo;s share of income taxes. In a <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/baseline-distribution-tables-version-0515-1-model/share-federal-taxes-all-tax-6\">June 2015 report</a>, the Tax Policy Center said&nbsp;the top 0.1 percent&nbsp;pay 21.1 percent of all individual income taxes and the bottom 60 percent pays&nbsp;1.5 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, also ran the numbers and told us Shilling&rsquo;s claim is accurate. But Cole noted that under Trump&rsquo;s plan:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- People in the 40th to 60th percentiles have about 99 percent of their income tax liability removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- People in the 0 to 40th percentiles who paid positive income taxes have about 100 percent of their income tax liability removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So the reason Trump&rsquo;s plan doesn&rsquo;t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that is, well, you can&rsquo;t cut middle-class income taxes by more than that,&quot; Cole said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the figures back Shilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, shortly before she made her claim, Trump&rsquo;s tax proposal <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/11/trying-pin-down-what-donald-trump-thinks-about-abo/\">was changing</a>. Sort of. Maybe. Or was it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump&rsquo;s equivocation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the three days prior, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/11/trying-pin-down-what-donald-trump-thinks-about-abo/\">Trump said</a> he might raise, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Then <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/11/trying-pin-down-what-donald-trump-thinks-about-abo/\">he indicated</a> the wealthy would get tax cuts, but the cuts might be less than what is in his plan. And then <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-taxes-tax-reform-223041#ixzz48rQ7DxNb\">Politico reported</a> that Trump&rsquo;s campaign had enlisted conservative economists to revise his plan, and that they were advising a top tax rate of 28 percent -- higher than the 25 percent in Trump&rsquo;s proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of which has caused some confusion as to what Trump would do with taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, by the time Shilling made her statement, Trump had not changed his <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform\">tax proposal</a>, which remained on his campaign website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Indeed, for what it&#39;s worth, the day after Shilling&rsquo;s claim, a Trump spokeswoman <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/us/politics/donald-trump-wont-alter-tax-plan-spokeswoman-says-as-confusion-reigns.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times</a>: &quot;There are no changes being made to the plan.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shilling said that under Trump&#39;s tax plan, &quot;the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers -- people earning multiple millions of dollars a year, on average -- &nbsp;would get more tax relief than the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers combined.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A report from a respected nonpartisan research group calculates that the 0.1 percent -- those making more than $3.7 million per year -- would receive 18 percent of the tax cuts under Trump&rsquo;s proposal. The bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, meanwhile, would enjoy only 16.4 percent of the cuts. Another tax group found similar figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has indicated he might make alter his tax proposal, but he hadn&rsquo;t as of when Shilling made her statement -- so we rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.tmj4.com/on-air/politifact-trumps-tax-plan-benefits-the-wealthy\">Watch the WTMJ-TV PolitiFact segment on this fact check</a>.
