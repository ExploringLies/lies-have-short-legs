Joe Sanfelippo changed as it worked its way from drafting through passage to the desk of Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive who is expected to sign it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut the fundamentals haven&rsquo;t changed since Sanfelippo unveiled his first draft in January 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFrom the get-go, the West Allis representative wanted voters to decide on trimming Milwaukee County supervisors&#39; pay. The initial proposal was a cut from $50,679 to $15,000 a year. In the bill&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/proposals/ab85-engrossed\">final version</a>, the April 2014 referendum still deals with supervisors&rsquo; pay, but the pay cut is smaller -- about 50%, reducing the salary to about $24,000. The precise pay is tied to per-capita income in Milwaukee County. If voters approve the pay cut, supervisors would lose health and pension benefits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut a reading of the final bill shows that county voters will not be asked whether the County Board&rsquo;s budget should be cut by two-thirds under a budget-capping formula outlined in the bill.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThere is no referendum on the budget cap, contrary to what Vukmir&rsquo;s May 15 release stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s been true since Sanfelippo first went public with a draft in mid-January.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/gmc-pledges-to-actively-campaign-for-the-push-to-cut-supervisors-pay-bj8bl5o-186481371.html\">Journal Sentinel story </a>on his announcement was headlined: &quot;A $5 million cut to County Board budget won&rsquo;t go before voters.&quot; (The cut initially was larger than in the final bill; it&rsquo;s now about $4 million).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBottom line: The bulk of the hoped-for $4 million savings annually in the County Board budget would be accomplished if Walker signs the legislation -- without voters weighing in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSimilarly, without requiring voters to sign off, the bill requires supervisors to stand for election every two years instead of every four, and scales back the board&rsquo;s role in contracts, land sales and labor negotiations, as the Journal Sentinel reported.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVukmir aide Jason Booth blamed confusion about the contents of the bill for the error on the scope of the referendum.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tProponents of the bill, including current Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele and top Milwaukee business leaders, say it would restore authority to the county executive&rsquo;s office and streamline county decision-making.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSanfelippo has claimed his bill puts Milwaukee County Board spending in line with other major counties. We rated that statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/05/joe-sanfelippo/sanfelippo-says-bill-puts-milwaukee-county-board-s/\">Mostly True</a>. Sanfelippo, himself a former Milwaukee County Board member, thinks supervisors should be part-time citizen legislators starting in 2016.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut others see the legislation as an anti-democratic power grab that will put too much power in the executive branch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;With the long history of Milwaukee County Executives abusing their power, this bill is a dangerous step in the wrong direction, Senate Democratic Leader <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/130515Larson.pdf\">Chris Larson</a>, D-Milwaukee, said upon passage. &quot;Unfortunately, this bill flies in the face of the trust in the people of Milwaukee County and our Democratic system.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVukmir contended that Milwaukee County voters would decide whether the County Board budget takes a big cut.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s wrong. A referendum would determine County Board supervisors&rsquo; pay, but most of the changes in the bill -- including the County Board&rsquo;s budget level -- would take effect directly through the legislation, without voter approval in 2014.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe rate her claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-21T16:23:35.236031", "ruling_date": "2013-05-22T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State senator says referendum on County Board allows voters to decide on cutting budget", "ruling_headline_slug": "state-senator-says-referendum-county-board-broad", "ruling_link_text": "Referendum is much narrower", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid--8f586f9-c8c0-1141-c552-cf3aeaabe7a7\">\r\n\tState Senator Leah Vukmir, <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/130515Vukmir.pdf\">press release</a>, &quot;Senate Passes Milwaukee County Reform Bill,&quot; May 15, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPhone interview with Jason Booth, communications director, Sen.
