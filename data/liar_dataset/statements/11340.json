Voters approved that measure in 2012 to pay for schools and balance the state&rsquo;s budget. The income tax is due to expire in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action\">Common Sense Kids Action</a>, a child advocacy group, stated in September that the tax on the wealthy should be <a href=\"https://www.oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/Title%20and%20Summary%20%2815-0070%29.pdf\">extended</a>, citing continued health and education needs for California&rsquo;s large number of impoverished children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California has more kids in poverty and greater income inequality than virtually any other state. The Invest in California&rsquo;s Children Act asks the wealthiest to pay a little more so we can make the investments every California kid needs to have a great start in life,&quot; the advocacy group said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said this in a press release unveiling one of multiple proposals to extend Proposition 30 that California voters will likely decide in November 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we wanted to fact-check whether California has more kids in poverty than any other state, an eye-opening claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/5756939/IMG_5325P.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/5756939/IMG_5325P.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:800px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Staff at Sacramento Food Bank &amp; Family Services help clients in north Sacramento.&nbsp;Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facts are pretty clear: California does have the most children<strong> </strong>under the age of 18 in poverty at<strong> </strong>2.05 million, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau report on the topic. That&rsquo;s far more than Texas, the state with the next highest number of children in poverty with about 1.7 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fact that the state has the most children in poverty is mainly driven by the fact that it is the most populous state,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/bio.asp?i=315\">Caroline Danielson</a>, who studies poverty at the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), a nonpartisan research group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At nearly 39 million, California&rsquo;s population dwarfs second place Texas, which is home to about 27 million people. Third place Florida, with its nearly 20 million people, has about 650,000 children in poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a deeper understanding of child poverty in California, we wanted to see what percent of the state&rsquo;s children are impoverished and how that compares with other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer, it turns out, is hard to find and depends on what poverty measurement you look at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The census bureau&rsquo;s standard reports show 22.7 percent of California&rsquo;s children live in poverty. But fourteen other states had higher child poverty rates. The top three are New Mexico at 29.5 percent; Mississippi at 29.4 percent; and Louisiana at 27.9 percent, according to the bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California ranks as the most impoverished state in the bureau&rsquo;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-254.pdf\">supplemental poverty measure</a>,&quot; which researchers consider more meaningful because it<strong> </strong>accounts for cost of living. That measure, however, does not distinguish between child and adult poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To hone in on the state&rsquo;s child poverty rate, PPIC, created a <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/publication.asp?i=1070\">California Poverty Measure</a>. Through that analysis, which takes into account cost of living and government assistance programs, PPIC found California&rsquo;s child poverty rate for 2012 was 24.9 percent, higher than the census bureau&rsquo;s rate. The institute only studied California&rsquo;s child poverty rate, so we can&rsquo;t<strong> </strong>compare it with other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if that comparison were possible?<strong> </strong>&quot;I would suspect that California&rsquo;s child poverty rate would be in the top five in the nation,&quot; Danielson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common Sense Kids Action says &quot;California has more kids in poverty ... than virtually any state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The census bureau shows in its most recent standard report that California, indeed, has more people under 18 in poverty than any other state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean California has a bigger problem with child poverty &mdash; per capita &mdash; than all other states. There are 14 states, led by New Mexico and Mississippi, with higher child poverty rates, at least by the official measure.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, the statement is literally accurate. But it should be noted that California&rsquo;s population is so large it leads the nation in practically everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">more</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-22T19:01:02.604216", "ruling_date": "2015-12-04T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Does California have the most children in poverty?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-california-have-most-children-poverty", "ruling_link_text": "Counting a sad statistic", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf\">Income and Poverty in the United States: 2014</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-254.pdf\" id=\"anch_512\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(79, 58, 116); text-decoration: none; border: 0px; outline: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: 13px; background-color: transparent;\">The Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2014</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Robert Bernstein, spokesman, U.S. Census Bureau, Sept. 23, 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/bio.asp?i=315\">Caroline Danielson, senior fellow, Public Policy Institute of California</a>, Sept. 23, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3294, "last_name": "Common Sense Kids Action", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "common-sense-kids-action", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-politifact-mugs-PolitiFact_silhouettes_19.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3294/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;California has more kids in poverty ... than virtually any other state.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press release", "statement_date": "2015-09-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 29, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/29/", "subject": "Poverty", "subject_slug": "poverty", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
