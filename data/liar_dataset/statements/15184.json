Other cases cited either had not yet been filed or had been closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest donation was $2,500 from attorney Howard Sicula in June 2017. He had a <a href=\"https://wcca.wicourts.gov/courtRecordEvents.do;jsessionid=9857AB80D4EFEDE0001793F86E230CBF.render6?caseNo=2015CV008323&amp;countyNo=40&amp;cacheId=513B15E791057D9538E0ED40FE5B62C9&amp;recordCount=1&amp;offset=0&amp;linkOnlyToForm=false&amp;sortDirection=DESC\">wrongful death case</a> pending in Dallet&rsquo;s court at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to the thrust of the GOP&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dallet a &lsquo;hypocrite&rsquo;?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The billboard refers viewers to an anti-Dallet state GOP <a href=\"http://doubletalkdallet.com/\">website</a>. It cites comments Dallet made at a Jan. 22, 2018 Federalist Society <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVPjbTv_Acc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33m40s\">Supreme Court debate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dallet began by saying: &quot;So, I do recuse myself when there is any appearance that it&rsquo;s not going to be fair.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP contends that statement means Dallet is a hypocrite because she took campaign contributions from lawyers who had cases before her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the rest of Dallet&rsquo;s statement makes it clear she didn&rsquo;t pledge not to take campaign contributions from lawyers, but rather that she would recuse herself from cases in which her husband&rsquo;s law firm was involved. She also drew a contrast with the first campaign of state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who decided not to seek reelection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the rest of Dallet&rsquo;s statement during the debate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>My husband works for Husch Blackwell, a larger firm, and I made the decision to remove myself from any case that they handle. That is not required by our ethics rules &hellip; but I decided that the better course of action, so that it is fair to everyone involved, is to just recuse myself from all those cases &hellip;.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This is not about contributions from attorneys to our campaigns; that is allowed by our ethics rules. And certainly if it was an extreme amount, that would be something that the judge would have to look at. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What we&rsquo;re talking about with our recusal rules, that is the issue that I&rsquo;ve been talking about, is the fact that when a party is in front of the case (judge) and that party has spent money -- significant amount of money, massive amounts of money, like the $2.25 million spent on Justice Gableman&rsquo;s campaign -- how can anyone look at that and think that that&rsquo;s fair?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dallet also referred to recusing herself from cases involving her husband&rsquo;s firm in January 2018 at a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JudgeDallet/videos/367532400385394/\">candidates event</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGfWkaB_BhU\">an interview</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it does not bear on the rating of this fact check, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Wisconsin State Journal <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/supreme-court-candidate-stayed-on-cases-despite-saying-she-would/article_da894258-40a1-5bf4-9ac9-c3cf33836c83.html\">reported </a>in early March 2018 that Dallet presided over at least one case involving attorneys from her husband&rsquo;s law firm; and that Dallet recused herself from three recent cases on her docket involving attorneys from the firm after being asked about them by the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Republican Party says Dallet is a &quot;hypocrite&quot; because she &quot;took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dallet has received campaign donations from lawyers who had cases in her court -- something that is common in judicial campaigns and allowed by state judicial ethics rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on the hypocrite part of the GOP&rsquo;s statement, Dallet did not pledge that she would not accept contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. Rather, her pledge was to recuse herself from cases in which her husband&rsquo;s law firm was involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-23T14:53:02.946109", "ruling_date": "2018-03-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin GOP attack on Supreme Court candidate Rebecca Dallet mostly misfires", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-gop-attack-supreme-court-candidate-rebec", "ruling_link_text": "Promise was about husband's firm, not campaign money from lawyers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Republican Party, <a href=\"https://www.wisgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Billboard-Mockup.jpg\">billboard</a>, March 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Alec Zimmerman, March 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Rebecca Dallet campaign spokeswoman Gillian Drummond, March 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://doubletalkdallet.com/\">DoubleTalkDallet.com</a>, accessed March 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JudgeDallet/videos/367532400385394/\">Supreme Court candidates event</a> (20:00), Jan. 29, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGfWkaB_BhU\">Wisconsin Eye interview of Rebecca Dallet</a>, Jan. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVPjbTv_Acc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33m40s\">video</a> (33:50) of Federalist Society Supreme Court debate, Jan. 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin State Journal, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/supreme-court-candidate-stayed-on-cases-despite-saying-she-would/article_da894258-40a1-5bf4-9ac9-c3cf33836c83.html\">&quot;Supreme Court candidate stayed on case despite saying she would step away,&quot;</a> March 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Republican Party, <a href=\"https://www.wisgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dallet-Judicial-Commission-Complaint-signed.pdf\">Judicial Commission complaint</a>, March 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Circuit Court Access Program, <a href=\"https://wcca.wicourts.gov/courtRecordEvents.do;jsessionid=DE3B94E6E5B384B02228A44B84A6BDCC.render6?caseNo=2015CV008323&amp;countyNo=40&amp;cacheId=513B15E791057D9538E0ED40FE5B62C9&amp;recordCount=1&amp;offset=0&amp;linkOnlyToForm=false&amp;sortDirection=DESC\">Howard Sicula case</a>, accessed March 21, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 863, "last_name": "Republican Party of Wisconsin", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "republican-party-wisconsin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GOP_elephant_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/863/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.wisgop.org"}, "statement": "<p>Says Rebecca Dallet is a &quot;hypocrite&quot;
