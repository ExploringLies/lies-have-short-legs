Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, made a specific claim about public support for such checks during a floor debate about Senate Bill 101, which she feared would expand access to guns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks,&quot; Orrock said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSB 101 would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they&rsquo;ve completed basic military training, as long as they were not dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless a ban is required by federal law or regulation. It passed the Senate by a 41-10 vote and is being reviewed by the state House of Representatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia decided to do some checking to see whether the senator is correct or is she exaggerating public support for such guidelines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the December shootings of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., President Barack Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of coming up with legislation to stem such violence. In January, Obama announced a series of proposals that includes background checks for all gun sales.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check, which is commonly known as a &quot;universal background check.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeveral Democrats, including Obama, have said about 40 percent of all guns are sold without a background check. PolitiFact has reviewed this claim several times and noted it&rsquo;s based on a 1997 study, rating it Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLiz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the state Senate Democrats, sent us several polls she says support Orrock&rsquo;s point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s a look at some of the polls Flowers sent us and some we found:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">\r\n\t\tThe Pew Research Center conducted a poll Jan. 9-13 that found 85 percent of Americans support background checks for private and gun show sales.

About one-half of the respondents were interviewed on land lines; the other half on their cellphones. One-third of those polled said they had a gun in their home.

The poll was conducted Feb. 18-21. The respondents were asked &quot;do you favor or oppose requiring all gun buyers to pass a criminal background check, no matter where they buy the gun and no matter whom they buy it from?&quot; The largest portion of respondents, 38 percent, said they were Democrats.
