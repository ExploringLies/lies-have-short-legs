This follow-up, too, <a href=\"http://theusa-news.com/breaking-crash-killed-tucker-carlson-no-accident\">ended up</a> <a href=\"http://conservativefighter.com/breaking/breaking-crash-that-killed-tucker-carlson-was-no-accident/\">on other</a> <a href=\"http://www.redbox.news/2017/05/13/breaking-crash-killed-tucker-carlson-no-accidentbreaking-crash-that-killed-tucker-carlson-was-no-accident/\">websites</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, we know the story is fake, because Carlson is alive. A Fox News Channel spokeswoman confirmed to us that the articles are a hoax. She also noted that Carlson is based in Washington, not New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post is yet another fake news story created by the parody purveyor TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/31/blog-posting/fake-news-post-wrongly-says-ken-starr-died-plane-c/\">website that</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/23/blog-posting/former-first-grandma-marian-robinson-caught-anothe/\">has been the</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/28/blog-posting/trump-did-not-give-every-working-american-612-thro/\">source of several</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/09/blog-posting/image-obama-handcuffs-wiretapping-trump-fake-photo/\">fake news stories</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/13/blog-posting/it-trap-story-fbi-issued-warrant-obama-trump-wiret/\">that we&rsquo;ve</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/31/blog-posting/no-meryl-streeps-anti-trump-rant-didnt-cost-her-ha/\">previously checked</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site&rsquo;s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don&rsquo;t rely on facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original fake post that Carlson had been in a crash <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fox-star-tucker-carlson-in-critical-condition-after-head-on-collision-driving-home/\">appeared on the site on May 13</a>, and its follow-up <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-crash-that-killed-tucker-carlson-was-no-accident/\">was published May 14</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then TheLastLineOfDefense.org published another story on May 14 that said the death rumors were actually <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/busta-troll-just-lowered-your-cholesterol/\">a hoax perpetrated by someone who goes by the name Busta Troll</a>. He had been paid more than $100,000 by billionaire George Soros to make up the story, the post said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the update is written to make it sound as if TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled into thinking Carlson had died because of Busta Troll, the real story is that Wilekenmeyer (or whatever his true name may be) actually is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheRealBustaTroll/#\">Busta Troll</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troll character is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QfhbcEY-6u4\">part of a years-long saga</a> involving the author &quot;<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=goating\">goating</a>&quot; conservative web pages and using pseudonyms to spread contrived stories aimed at fooling conservative readers. A complex scheme to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-goats-take-over-facebook-page-20140624-column.html\">expose the identity of Busta Troll in 2014</a> turned out to be yet another trolling scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org had followed a similar strategy in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/may/01/blog-posting/reports-about-ted-nugent-dying-or-not-hunting-trip/\">April 2017 when saying that conservative rocker Ted Nugent</a> had first been killed in a hunting accident, then had been assassinated, then had actually faked his own death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nugent was still alive, and so is Carlson.
