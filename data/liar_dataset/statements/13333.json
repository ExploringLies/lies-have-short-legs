Let&rsquo;s look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has already looked into Hassan&rsquo;s claim that Ayotte voted against a proposal to expand background checks and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2016/jun/21/maggie-hassan/challenger-maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-a/\">found it Mostly True. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we are going to look at what ISIS says about buying guns in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hassan&rsquo;s camp pointed us to a series of news articles in which members of various terrorist groups talk about the ease of getting guns in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A former Islamic State recruit <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/world/middleeast/isis-german-recruit-interview.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times in August</a> that the terrorist group tries to draw its recruits from within the U.S. because they can buy guns without a middleman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For America and Canada, it&rsquo;s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb &mdash; they have open gun policies,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/04/the-islamic-state-likes-americas-dumb-gun-laws-defector-says/\">Harry Sarfo told the Times from a German prison, when explaining attitudes within the terror group.</a> &quot;They say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don&rsquo;t need to have a contact man who has to provide guns for them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hassan&rsquo;s camp also directed us to a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/11/politics/al-qaeda-video/index.html\">2011 video</a> featuring American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn in which he talked about lax gun laws in the U.S. and urged followers to take advantage of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,&quot; Gadahn said, according to CNN. &quot;You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gadahn was with al-Qaeda, not ISIS. Still, he urged terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those two examples are enough to show that terrorists have advertised the U.S. gun laws, and &quot;it is something they think about internally,&quot; said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine if these are part of a widespread advertising campaign, or just isolated examples. A lof of ISIS communication is never circulated on the internet, Gartenstein-Ross cautioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On other occasions, PolitiFact has examined whether people can buy guns without background checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/05/barack-obama/obama-violent-felons-can-buy-guns-online-without-b/\">Currently federal law requires prospective gun buyers undergo background checks when they buy guns from federally licensed dealers -- but there are notable exceptions. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms &quot;with the principal motive of making a profit&quot; has to get a dealer&rsquo;s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the law does not require a dealer&rsquo;s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if an individual buys a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet, or at a gun show, he or she would not be subject to a background check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are <a href=\"http://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c4_009.htm#ep308518\">many restrictions on shipping guns</a>, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers &quot;can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,&quot; Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/05/barack-obama/obama-violent-felons-can-buy-guns-online-without-b/\">has previously told PolitiFact</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, several states &mdash; California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington &mdash; and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-study-finds-vast-online-marketplace-for-guns-without-background-checks/2013/08/05/19809198-fd73-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html\">according to a 2013 study by Third Way</a>, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website <a href=\"http://www.armslist.com/\">Armslist.com</a>, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, <a href=\"http://www.thirdway.org/report/the-virtual-loophole-a-survey-of-online-gun-sales\">Third Way found</a> 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional efforts to expand background checks for purchases made at gun shows or online have failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent review by the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html\"> New York Times</a> found the majority of guns used in 16 recent mass shootings were obtained legally, including the attack in Orlando that left nearly 50 people dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shooter in that incident, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before he gunned down patrons at the Pulse nightclub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hassan said the Islamic State knows its followers can buy firearms &quot;online and at gun shows&quot; and is &quot;advertising it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interview in the New York Times with a former Islamic State recruit shows group members acknowledge American recruits can buy guns, so long as they don&rsquo;t have a record. And a 2011 video from an al Qaeda spokesman urges terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is little evidence to suggest a widespread advertising campaign, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell, because not all ISIS communication is on the Internet, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-24T11:49:52.633630", "ruling_date": "2016-10-24T11:47:28", "ruling_headline": "Maggie Hassan says ISIS advertises lax U.S. gun laws", "ruling_headline_slug": "maggie-hassan-says-isis-advertises-lax-us-gun-laws", "ruling_link_text": "Examples exist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>New York Times,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/world/middleeast/isis-german-recruit-interview.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">How a Secretive Branch of ISIS&nbsp;Built a Global Network of Killers</a>, August 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/11/politics/al-qaeda-video/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Al Queda Video</a>,&nbsp;April 12, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html\" target=\"_blank\">How They Got Their Guns</a>,&nbsp;June 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Aaron Jacobs, spokesman for the Maggie Hassan campaign, October 5, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with&nbsp;Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, October 21, 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Candidate for governor", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Maggie", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 2073, "last_name": "Hassan", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "maggie-hassan", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitifactHassan.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Hampshire", "edition": "New Hampshire", "edition_slug": "new-hampshire", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 47, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Hampshire Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/47/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2073/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.maggiehassan.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;With her solution, terrorists can still today &mdash; and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it &mdash; buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate", "statement_date": "2016-10-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 211, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/211/", "subject": "Islam", "subject_slug": "islam", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kelly ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 1627, "last_name": "Ayotte", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "kelly-ayotte", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Ayotte_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1627/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://ayotte.senate.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
