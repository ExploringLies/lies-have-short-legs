Iran, which was within three months of getting a nuclear bomb, committed to not pursue nuclear weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deal contains other elements, but a key one is that all of the European Union and most American sanctions against Iran were lifted. Critics say that effectively amounts to a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-gets-keep-150-billion-even-if-us/\">$150 billion</a> check (though some say it&rsquo;s more like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-gets-keep-150-billion-even-if-us/\">$100 billion</a>) to Iran -- a reference to the amount of Iran&rsquo;s assets frozen in foreign banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/world-leaders-gathered-in-anticipation-of-iran-sanctions-being-lifted/2016/01/16/72b8295e-babf-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html\">reported</a> that Iran has more than $100 billion in available frozen assets &mdash; most of it in banks in China, Japan and South Korea &mdash; but that slightly less than half will more or less automatically go to preexisting debts. &quot;How the rest is spent will reveal the direction of internal power struggles between Iranian hard-liners and pragmatists,&quot; the article said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>John Kerry</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back the claim about the Obama administration and funds going directly to terrorism, the Johnson campaign email links to a January 2016 <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/defense/266619-kerry-some-iran-sanctions-relief-will-go-to-terrorists?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=25532714&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9KcAIM4ZWAL0_bnAPVmR2MS03X1Jo5yENQdIq6oKjl0ODvM21UhxqoXMrlX8bFqem6oi7zgY3YOOV2U0y4bX-EbD6z0kO0kF01ebPJoLt9uqozUA4&amp;_hsmi=25532714\">news article</a> in The Hill about comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry had told <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/21/sec-of-state-kerry-iran-was-hurtling-toward-a-full-fledged-nuclear-weapon-program.html\">CNBC&rsquo;s &quot;Squawk Box&quot;</a> that Iran would get only $55 billion of the $150 billion referenced, saying the rest is committed to China and other countries:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.

In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC&rsquo;s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately will end up with organizations involved in terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not the same as funds going directly to terrorism, as Johnson claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry did tell reporters the same day, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/kerry-rejects-iranian-criticism-us-sanctions-36419935\">according to</a> the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is &quot;already complaining that they are not getting the money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kerry also said the Obama administration believes the amount of money that might flow to terrorist groups will be limited because &quot;the demands of Iran and of the Rouhani administration and of the supreme leader for development in their country are such that there is no way they can succeed in doing what they want to do if they are very busy funding a lot of terrorism and if they are putting money into that kind of enterprise and not into things they need to do to fund their economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Kerry&rsquo;s comments weren&rsquo;t the first of their kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s campaign cited to us statements made in August 2015 by senior administration officials to a U.S. Senate committee.
