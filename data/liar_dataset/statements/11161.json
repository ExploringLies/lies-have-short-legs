Scott Walker&#39;s talking points -- a claim about the size of Wisconsin&rsquo;s budget stabilization fund -- is striking in seemingly contradictory ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is how Walker phrased the claim Aug. 3, 2015 at a presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327157-1/2016-republican-candidates-voters-first-forum&amp;live\">forum</a> in New Hampshire:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our rainy day fund&#39;s 165 times bigger than when we first took office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one hand, &quot;165 times&quot; sounds like a huge increase. On the other, what was the size of the fund if it could be made 165 times larger?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&#39;s dig in a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Walker&#39;s claim, the governor&#39;s office cited two state reports. They show that the so-called rainy day fund was <a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Documents/DEBF/Financial%20Reporting/AFR/WI%202010%20AFR.pdf\">$1.68 million</a> when Walker took office and now is <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2015-17%20Budget/Documents/Joint%20Finance/2015_07_07%20WI%20Leg%20Structural%20Deficit.pdf\">$280 million</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s more than 165 times bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some history</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wisconsin Legislature <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/31/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-has-made-first-back-back/\">created</a> the budget stabilization fund with a 1985 <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/16/III/518/3\">law</a>. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/informational-papers/documents/2015/76_budget%20stabilization%20fund%20and%20general%20fund%20reserve%20requirements.pdf\">No significant deposits</a> were made during the first 20 years of the fund&rsquo;s existence, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state&rsquo;s budget scorekeeper. But the 2001-&rsquo;03 state budget added a requirement that whenever the state budget runs a surplus, 50 percent of the surplus must be transferred to the fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, a governor is required to put money in the rainy day fund whenever there is a surplus; it&#39;s not a voluntary act. At the same time, a governor can take some credit for there being a surplus in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/informational-papers/documents/2015/76_budget%20stabilization%20fund%20and%20general%20fund%20reserve%20requirements.pdf\">three deposits</a> to the rainy day fund as a result of budget surpluses since Walker took office in January 2011:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fall 2011:</strong> $15 million. That was a result of a surplus in the final budget of Walker&rsquo;s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. (The end of that budget, it should be noted, came at the beginning of Walker&#39;s term. So, adjustments and actions in the final six months under Walker helped lead to the surplus.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fall 2012:</strong> $109 million. While that was the largest deposit to the fund in state history at the time, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-steering-1087-million-of-surplus-to-rainy-day-fund-7i7831n-174264061.html\">noted</a>, it was only enough to run state government for about three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fall 2013:</strong> $153 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those deposits, plus interest earned, put the total in the rainy day fund at $280 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, with another surplus projected, Walker proposed a combination of tax cuts and adding another $117 million to the rainy day fund. But the tax-cut <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/acts/145/9437/_5?down=1\">legislation</a> he later signed suspended the required contributions to the fund for the 2013-&rsquo;15 biennium. (The state&#39;s fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had the requirement remained in effect, it would have meant another <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Bill-Summaries/Documents/2013-15Bills/2014_02_27%20WI%20Leg%20Jan%20SS%20AB%201%20SB%201.pdf\">$113 million</a> in the rainy day fund. Walker instead used the money instead to help cut taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, there&rsquo;s no question the fund has grown significantly under Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said Wisconsin&rsquo;s &quot;rainy day fund&quot; is &quot;165 times bigger than when we first took office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $280 million currently in the budget stabilization fund is 165 times larger than the $1.68 million when Walker took office. Walker signed a tax cut law in 2014 that contained a provision voiding a requirement that would have put another $113 million into the fund. But that doesn&rsquo;t change how much larger the fund is..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Walker&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#39;s note: </strong>After this item was published, a spokeswoman for Walker&#39;s gubernatorial office noted that the budget that resulted in the Fall 2001 contribution overlapped with Walker&#39;s time in office. The item has&nbsp;been adjusted to reflect that.
