Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise,&quot; the post said. (The presidential election was held more than seven months ago, Nov. 8, 2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article speculated on Cher&rsquo;s relocation, even though the headline presented a more affirmative claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger,&quot; the post said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/stars-who-threatened-to-leave-the-u-s-if-trump-was-elected/\">Several</a> <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7572631/musicians-moving-canada-twitter-staying-going\">celebrities</a> <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/20-stars-who-pledged-flee-country-trump-was-elected-are-they-945888/item/whoopi-goldberg-leaving-country-945908\">did say</a> they would leave the United States,<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/entertainment/celebs-canada-donald-trump/index.html\"> including to Canada</a>, if Trump was elected. On her part, Cher joked she would move to <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2016/11/05/cher-if-donald-trump-wins-im-leaving-this-planet/\">another planet</a>, Jupiter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reply to a Twitter user, Cher wrote on June 16, 2015, the day Trump announced his candidacy: &quot;IF HE WERE TO BE ELECTED,IM MOVING TO JUPITER \ud83d\ude16&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the singer via social media for comment but did not get a response. Cher&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.cher.com/#/\">website</a> lists a series of upcoming performances in Las Vegas and Washington for the rest of the year. And while her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cher?lang=en\">Twitter feed</a> features a series of tweets criticizing Trump and his policies, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=canada%20canada%20from%3Acher&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">search</a> of the word &quot;Canada&quot; in her tweets did not yield any message saying she had moved up north.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cher also attended the Women&rsquo;s March on Washington on Jan. 21. &quot;I want to let people know that I&#39;m here for them and I believe in this movement,&quot; Cher <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/92390951-132.html\">told the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that conservativearmy88.com&rsquo;s website does not have any information identifying who runs it, its mission, where it&rsquo;s based or other information that credible news organizations publish on their website. Its post don&rsquo;t have author names and are all posted by a site administrator, &quot;admin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservativearmy88.com&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/Conservativearmy88/about/?ref=page_internal\">Facebook page</a> lists a Hotmail email address. We reached out but did not get a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While several celebrities claimed they would move to Canada if Trump won the presidency, Cher joked she would to Jupiter. Cher&rsquo;s still on planet Earth, but there&rsquo;s no indication she&rsquo;s in Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate conservativearmy88.com&rsquo;s post False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-25T17:23:25.321076", "ruling_date": "2017-07-26T15:15:22", "ruling_headline": "Did Cher move to Canada because of Donald Trump?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-cher-move-canada-because-donald-trump", "ruling_link_text": "Still in USA", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Conservativearmy88.com, <a href=\"http://conservativearmy88.com/breaking-hollywood-star-moving-canada-president-trump/\">BREAKING: A Hollywood Star Is Moving To Canada Because Of President Trump</a>, July 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservativearmy88.com&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Conservativearmy88/about/?ref=page_internal\">Facebook page</a>, accessed July 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, @Cher, June 16, 2015 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cher/status/610956742545911809?lang=en\">tweet</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=canada%20canada%20from%3Acher&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">search</a> of @Cher&rsquo;s account for &quot;Canada&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/stars-who-threatened-to-leave-the-u-s-if-trump-was-elected/\">Stars who threatened to leave the U.S. if Trump was elected</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Billboard.com, <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7572631/musicians-moving-canada-twitter-staying-going\">Musicians on Moving to Canada: Who&#39;s Going, Who&#39;s Staying, Who&#39;s Offering Shelter?</a>, Nov. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hollywood Reporter, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/20-stars-who-pledged-flee-country-trump-was-elected-are-they-945888/item/whoopi-goldberg-leaving-country-945908\">20 Stars Who Pledged to Flee the Country If Trump Was Elected: Where Are They Now?</a>, Nov. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/entertainment/celebs-canada-donald-trump/index.html\">Celebs moving if Donald Trump wins</a>, Nov. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Page Six, <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2016/11/05/cher-if-donald-trump-wins-im-leaving-this-planet/\">Cher: If Trump wins, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have to leave the planet&rsquo;</a>, Nov. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cher.com, <a href=\"https://www.cher.com/#/\">Upcoming events</a>, accessed July 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Los Angeles Times,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/92390951-132.html\">Cher with Jesse Jackson at the Women&#39;s March on Washington</a>, Jan. 21, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Cher &quot;is moving to Canada because of President Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2017-07-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
