It goes on to say that he took &quot;$36,550 from payday lenders, then let them stick our troops with outrageous fees. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is no secret that payday lenders routinely sock consumers with excessively high charges and fees. But did Barr &quot;let them&quot; stick military families with outrageous fees, while also taking money from them for his campaign?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes and no.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">First, some background</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2005/fil1405a.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</a> &quot;payday loans are small-dollar, short-term, unsecured loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck or regular income payment.&quot; Payday loans often include very high interest rates or fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama through the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010,&nbsp;launched the nation&#39;s first program for supervising &quot;non-bank&quot; financial services, which include payday loan providers, as well as debt collectors, mortgage companies and credit-score companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">So what did Barr do, exactly?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At issue is Barr&rsquo;s 2017 vote for the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/10/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22CHOICE+act%22%5D%7D&amp;amp;r=1\" target=\"_blank\">Financial CHOICE Act</a>, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Barr was one of seven original cosponsors of the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill would make sweeping changes and repeal provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, in part by weakening the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the plan, the agency would lose its oversight of payday lenders. There is a line in the <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170605/BILLS-115HR10-HAmdt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legislation</a> that says, &quot;the agency may not exercise any rulemaking, enforcement, or other authority with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Honor spokeswoman Ellen Zeng also pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/06/07/major-financial-bill-may-eliminate-some-troop-protections.html\" target=\"_blank\">June 2017 Military.com</a> article that grappled with whether the bill would undo certain protections for active and retired service members and their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bureau has played a major role in &quot;providing restitution and help to troops taken advantage of by illegal financial practices,&quot; the article states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One program, in the bureau&#39;s&nbsp;Office of Servicemember Affairs department, has fielded over 74,000 complaints about predatory financial practices from the military community since 2011, <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/our-office-servicemember-affairs-guides-you-through-financial-hurdles-your-military-career/\" target=\"_blank\">a 2017 CFPB report says</a>, resulting in more than $130 million in relief to affected service members.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">But then there&rsquo;s the Military Lending Act</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Barr&rsquo;s campaign released a <a href=\"https://www.andybarrforcongress.com/dark-money-group-supporting-amy-mcgrath-falsely-attacking-congressman-andy-barr/\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> after the ad aired calling it misleading. There are&nbsp;existing laws that protect military families from payday lenders, the campaign said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.responsiblelending.org/payday-lending/research-analysis/Summary-of-MLA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2006 Military Lending Act</a>&nbsp;put a 36 percent cap on the amount of interest small-dollar lenders could charge on loans to military families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When veterans groups raised concerns about the Financial CHOICE Act, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who sponsored the bill and chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said it would not touch protections for veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Financial Choice Act does not weaken the laws that specifically protect active-duty and retired members of our armed forces,&quot; he said in a June 2017 statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zeng says the group stands by the ad, as the bill would have drained the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she says plays a vital role in protecting military veterans and their families from predatory payday lenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Did Barr collect over $36,000 from payday lenders?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This part is pretty straight-forward. Yes, he did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F1420&amp;cycle=All&amp;recipdetail=H&amp;mem=Y\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, an authoritative database of campaign finance data, Barr has accepted $36,550 from PACs and individuals associated with the payday lending industry since his 2014 campaign. He has received $7,500 from payday lenders in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>With Honor says Barr &quot;would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops&quot; and that he received $36,550 in campaign donations from payday lenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that Bar has accepted $36,550 in donations from payday lenders. But the other part is more complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barr voted for legislation that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&rsquo;s power over payday lending agencies, which could indirectly affect military families as the agency fields complaints from the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a 2006 law provides servicemembers protection, with a 36 percent cap on the interest small-dollar lenders could charge families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while the CFPB could have provided more protections to the military community than the 2006 law, the ad makes it appear as if Barr&rsquo;s actions were connected to legislation specifically about veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"0191e990-a67f-4b21-ae23-5f4a27ba400d\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ClaimReview\"> <div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">2018-10-09 16:37:45 UTC</div> <div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"> <div itemprop=\"name\"><a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">PolitiFact</a></div> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://dhpikd1t89arn.cloudfront.net/logos/politifact_logo.png\" alt=\"PolitiFact\" /> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\">4</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"worstRating\">1</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"bestRating\">7</div> <img style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://dhpikd1t89arn.cloudfront.net/rating_images/politifact/tom-halftrue.jpg\" alt=\"PolitiFact rating logo\" /> PolitiFact Rating: <div style=\"font-weight: bold\" itemprop=\"alternateName\">Half True</div> </div> <div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\" itemprop=\"claimReviewed\">Says Kentucky Rep.
