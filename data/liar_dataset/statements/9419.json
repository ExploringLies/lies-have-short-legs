We found that it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, the Islamic terrorist organization Hamas captured Israeli Sgt. Gilad Shalit after tunneling into Israel and attacking an army outpost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel&rsquo;s first attempt to free Shalit, by launching a military invasion into Hamas-controlled Gaza, failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shalit was held captive for five years. During that time, many Israelis pleaded with their government to strike a deal for Shalit&rsquo;s return. Israel had already failed to secure the freedom of Air Force Navigator Ron Arad, who had crashed his warplane in Lebanon 25 years before his death in 2008 while in the control of Shiite captors. Many Israelis worried that Shalit&rsquo;s capture would end the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shalit returned home on Oct. 18, 2011, following Israel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/17/world/meast/israel-prisoner-swap-explainer/\"><u>freeing</u></a> of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not clear that all 1,027 were &quot;terrorists,&quot; but some<strong> </strong>were indeed terrorists serving several life sentences for killing Israeli citizens. (In addition, the definition of &quot;terrorist&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/jul/09/whats-definition-terrorism/\">varies quite a lot</a> depending on who is using the term.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Israeli minister who voted against the exchange called it &quot;a great victory for terrorism.&quot; That fear has been echoed in the wake of the Bergdahl exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krauthammer took issue with such claims in an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-free-bowe-bergdahl-then-try-him/2014/06/05/6aae0e50-ecd4-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html\"><u>op-ed</u></a> in the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The (Obama) administration might have tried honesty here and said: Yes, we gave away five important combatants. But that&rsquo;s what you do to redeem hostages,&quot; Krauthammer wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for what to do with Bergdahl, Krauthammer concludes that the right course is, &quot;Free him, then try him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krauthammer said Israel &quot;gave up 1000 terrorists in return for one sergeant.&quot; In 2011, Israel freed 1,027 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive by Hamas since 2006. While we can&#39;t confirm that all 1,027 were terrorists, some definitely were, and the definition of &quot;terrorist&quot; is often fuzzy.
