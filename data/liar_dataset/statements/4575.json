In one current case among metro Atlanta elected officials, a coming deadline has resulted in some attempted horse-trading and an interesting 11th-hour debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCounty commissioners and mayors across the 10-county region are attempting to finalize a list by Oct. 15 of transportation projects that area residents will vote on next year, along with a 1 percent sales tax to fund those projects. One area they&rsquo;re debating is a proposal to spend about $602 million on transit projects along the Atlanta Beltline.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta Mayor Kasim Reed wrote an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution arguing for money for the effort, which is located in the city limits and he argues will benefit the region. Sandy Springs Mayor Eva Galambos countered in a separate op-ed in the AJC that the $602 million should be spent on other projects that will better serve the region.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;These are worthy purposes for the city of Atlanta, but they are not related to relieving the Atlanta region&rsquo;s traffic congestion,&quot; Galambos wrote, referring to the Beltline. &quot;A close examination of the Beltline website map reveals an astounding fact: Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn astounding fact! Such a claim seemed ideal for PolitiFact Georgia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Beltline is a 22-mile loop of largely unused railroad tracks that circle around the core of Georgia&rsquo;s capital city. Atlanta political and business leaders embraced a Georgia Tech graduate student&rsquo;s suggestion to make better use of those lines and began an effort several years ago to build more homes, office space, parks and trails and construct a light-rail line along the Beltline. The effort is expected to take at least another decade before it is completed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeltline spokesman Ethan Davidson sent us an e-mail contending that Galambos was wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is absolutely false ... the Atlanta Beltline corridor will have at least three additional connections to MARTA at the following areas: Lindbergh/Armour, Inman Park/Reynoldstown and West End/Oakland City,&quot; Davidson wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe also sent us a YouTube video by the Beltline that says the Beltline environmental impact study area intersects with six MARTA stations. The study area extends a quarter-mile east and west of the Beltline&rsquo;s existing and former rail lines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at the same Beltline map that Galambos referred to when we talked to her. We spotted two MARTA stations that seemed to connect to the Beltline: Inman Park/Reynoldstown and Lindbergh Center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavidson explained that there are plans to connect the Beltline to the West End/Oakland City station.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;[The Beltline] doesn&rsquo;t work if it doesn&rsquo;t connect to MARTA. &hellip; That&rsquo;s the whole point of it,&quot; Davidson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn response to what we found, and the Beltline&rsquo;s argument, Galambos told us that the Lindbergh Center station did connect with the Beltline. Galambos admitted she erred in not saying the Beltline connects with the Lindbergh station.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That one is on the map,&quot; she said of Lindbergh.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mayor said her point about the Lindbergh MARTA station is that connecting it to the Beltline there won&rsquo;t help more people across the region to get around.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In terms of service, I didn&rsquo;t word it correctly,&quot; Galambos told us. &quot;In terms of additional connectivity, we&rsquo;re not getting any.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGalambos admitted she made a mistake by writing that the Beltline doesn&rsquo;t intersect MARTA at any of its stations. We thank her for her honesty. Still, her article went off the tracks on that point. We must give her a rating of False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-10T17:00:37.018921", "ruling_date": "2011-10-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mayor admits error on Beltline connection claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "mayor-admits-error-beltline-connection-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Claim veers off the tracks", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/opinion/should-the-beltline-get-1189292.html\">Pro &amp; Con: Should the Beltline get T-SPLOST money?</a>,&quot; Sept. 27, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta Beltline <a href=\"http://beltline.org/Portals/26/Images/materials/blp_map_packet_dld.pdf\">map</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta Beltline YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QntUgOUIuRA&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\">video</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from Atlanta Beltline Inc. spokesman Ethan Davidson, Sept. 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail exchange and telephone interview with Sandy Springs Mayor Eva Galambos, Sept. 29 and 30, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Mayor of Sandy Springs", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Eva", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1487, "last_name": "Galambos", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "eva-galambos", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Eva_Galambos.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1487/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an op-ed", "statement_date": "2011-09-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Claim about Beltline connection off-track"}
