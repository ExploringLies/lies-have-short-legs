Cuccinelli&rsquo;s statement referred to an Obamacare mandate &nbsp;-- scheduled to take effect in 2015 -- that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health care coverage to those working 30 hours or more a week or pay a fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obamacare became law in March 2010. We asked Cuccinelli&rsquo;s campaign for proof that most of the jobs created since then have been part-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, pointed us to a Sept. 2, 2013 <a href=\"http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/economy/hiring-explodes-in-part-time-and-contract-work/article_f653f2bb-291b-524b-84bc-dd94d20d2c61.html\"><u>article</u></a> in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that said the number of temporary U.S. workers had risen by 2.7 million -- a 50 percent jump -- since the recession ended in June 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those figures, however, don&rsquo;t verify Cuccinelli&rsquo;s claim that the majority of new jobs during the last 4-1/2 years have been part time. So we dug deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics each month reports the number of people who usually work full time and the number who usually work part time. It defines part-time employees as people who usually work less than 35 hours a week -- an even broader definition of part time than Cuccinelli cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2010, seasonally adjusted BLS figures show the U.S. had 111.2 million full-time workers. That rose to 116.2 million in &nbsp;August 2013, the latest month for which figures were available when Cuccinelli made his statement. That&rsquo;s an increase of about 5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of part-time jobs went from 27.5 million in March 2010 to just under 28 million in August 2013, an increase of about 500,000. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, contrary to Cuccinelli&rsquo;s claim, full-time jobs have grown 10 times faster than part-time employment since Obamacare was signed into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli would have been on more solid ground if he had confined his statement to this year. From January through August, there were increases of 290,000 full-time jobs and 532,000 part-time positions. In other words, nearly two out of three new jobs this year have been part time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many analysts think there&rsquo;s a connection between Obamacare and the surge in part-time jobs this year, although they also say the sluggish economy has a role in the increase. The employer insurance mandate originally was scheduled to begin next year, causing <a href=\"http://news.investors.com/politics-obamacare/100913-669013-obamacare-employer-mandate-a-list-of-cuts-to-work-hours-jobs.htm\"><u>hundreds</u></a> of businesses to announce they are hiring only part-time workers or scaling back hours to avoid the cost of providing benefits required by Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House announced in July it would push back the employer mandate to 2015. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco <a href=\"http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/august/part-time-work-employment-increase-recession/\"><u>wrote</u></a> in an Aug. 26 memo that the trend of part-time hiring might slacken now that the insurance requirement has been delayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fed researchers wrote that Obamacare&rsquo;s impact on part-time employment so far and in the future is &quot;likely to be small.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 19 percent of U.S. jobs are now part time. The researchers said once Obamacare is fully implemented, the proportion of part-time jobs is likely to increase by 1 to 2 percent &quot;or less.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Perry, a economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, recently cautioned against giving too much meaning to this year&rsquo;s part-time employment numbers, writing that the data is &quot;extremely volatile&quot; in the short term and needs to be considered over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note: Cuccinelli claimed that since the signing of Obamacare, most of the new jobs have been part time not only across the nation, but in Virginia as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spoke to several analysts while trying to research the state numbers. But there&rsquo;s no set of monthly numbers that shows the increase in full-time and part-time jobs between the signing of the Affordable Care Act and the time when Cuccinelli made his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli says that since President Barack Obama signed the health care law, most of the new jobs created in the country have been part time. He&rsquo;s flat out wrong. BLS figures show that since the signing in March 2010, there are 5 million more full-time workers and 500,000 more part-time employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli would have been on the putting for par if he&rsquo;d aimed his statement at the first eight months of this year, when 65 percent of new jobs were part time, although analysts differ on Obamacare&rsquo;s blame for that trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his shot at Obamacare since its inception wound up in the woods. We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-18T11:02:41.898569", "ruling_date": "2013-10-18T10:51:26", "ruling_headline": "Cuccinelli says most new jobs have been part-time since Obamacare became law", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuccinelli-says-most-new-jobs-have-been-part-time-", "ruling_link_text": "Criticism would have been better focused on this year", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Cuccinelli for Governor, <a href=\"http://www.standwithken.com/\"><u>&quot;Fighting for Virginia,&quot;</u></a>, Sept. &nbsp;19, 2013.
