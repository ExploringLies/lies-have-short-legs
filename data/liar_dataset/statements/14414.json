Wisconsin agrees to, among other things, provide up to $3 billion in incentives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sargent&rsquo;s staff told us her $1 million-per-job claim was based on a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-27/america-and-the-foxconn-dream\">column</a> posted on the Bloomberg Businessweek website that was written by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/columnists/AOZ1cdFX8mo/tim-culpan\">Tim Culpan</a>. Culpan is a Taiwan-based technology columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly, a commentary site. He wrote that Wisconsin &quot;is paying as much as $1 million per job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culpan&rsquo;s $1 million claim was widely circulated -- by state Superintendent of Schools <a href=\"https://rightwisconsin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/evers-email.jpg\">Tony Evers</a>, who is weighing a run for governor in 2018; state Senate Minority Leader <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenShilling/status/890587997565005825\">Jennifer Shilling</a>, D-La Crosse; and a host of national media, including <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/foxconn-wisconsin-investment\">Vanity Fair</a>, a Washington Post <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crampell/status/890541691945459714\">columnist</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/foxconned/535170/\">The Atlantic</a> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/07/27/the_wisconsin_foxconn_plant_will_be_staff_by_robots.html\">and</a> <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/716268/foxconns-big-jobs-promises\">others</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you take $3 billion in incentives -- the amount cited in Sargent&rsquo;s tweet -- and divide it by 3,000 jobs, you get $1 million per job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the $3 billion is the maximum -- to be paid only if Foxconn meets several requirements, including creating 13,000 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If fewer jobs are created, the incentives paid are less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what is the cost per job?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the per-job cost might be</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $3 billion -- up to $200 million per year for 15 years -- would amount to <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/28/foxconn-could-get-up-200-million-cash-year-state-residents-up-15-years/519687001/\">nearly 50 times</a> the previous record paid by Wisconsin taxpayers, when the state in 2010 offered $65 million in subsidies to keep Mercury Marine from moving a factory from Fond du Lac to Oklahoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates it would <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/bill_summaries/2017_19/0001_ss_ab_1_foxconn_fiserv_legislation_8_8_17.pdf\">take 25 years</a> for taxpayers to recover the bulk of that -- the $2.85 billion the state would be paying Foxconn in cash. (The other $150 million would be provided through a sales tax exemption.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the per-job cost, we turned to <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Foxconn-payments-for-jobs.pdf\">an analysis</a> by the Wisconsin Budget Project. The project is part of Kids Forward, formerly known as the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a left-leaning nonprofit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $2.85 billion in cash payments, according to the analysis, would amount to $219,000 per job if 13,000 jobs are created and $587,000 per job if 3,000 jobs are created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important note: As the analysis and Culpan noted, and as economist <a href=\"http://www.upjohn.org/about-us/who-we-are/research-staff/timothy-j-bartik\">Timothy Bartik</a> of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research told us, the more Foxconn gears its plant for robotics, the fewer jobs it will create -- and thus the per-job cost of the incentives will be higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about Sargent&rsquo;s taking down her tweet, one of her staff members told us the Bloomberg column &quot;was early,&quot; and that as more details of the incentive package were released, &quot;it became clear that estimates were more nuanced, and Melissa removed the tweet to prevent any confusion or misinformation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/07/26/scott-walker-heads-d-c-trump-prepares-wisconsin-foxconn-announcement/512077001/\">news</a> <a href=\"http://journaltimes.com/news/local/scott-walker-foxconn-won-t-get-b-unless-jobs-are/article_077c0330-26c1-576d-8d83-48f6577532ba.html\">reporting</a>, however, had been clear: up to $3 billion in incentives only if 13,000 jobs were created, not 3,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The staffer, citing the Wisconsin Budget Project analysis, also told us there will be costs to taxpayers beyond the $3 billion, such as local government spending on infrastructure improvements and state borrowing for Interstate 94 improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Sargent&rsquo;s tweet referred only to the $3 billion in incentives, not those other potential costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a tweet she later took down, Sargent said that on the Foxconn deal, &quot;3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways.
