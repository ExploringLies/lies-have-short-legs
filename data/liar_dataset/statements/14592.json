Conservative websites came down hard on Krugman for his error, taking it as a case study of mainstream media spreading fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no question that Krugman was wrong. Here&rsquo;s how the episode played out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/914167277175623681\">noon on Sept. 30</a>, Krugman tweeted, &quot;Cholera. In a US territory. Among US citizens. In the 21st century. Heckuva job, Trumpie.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/illness.html\">Cholera</a> is spread by bacteria in dirty water and can bring on severe diarrhea, so severe, it can even be&nbsp;fatal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within minutes, people peppered Krugman with tweets asking for his source and noting that that were no confirmed cases of cholera. A University of New Hampshire journalism professor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/914176416723415045\">wrote</a>, &quot;UPDATE (please share): Cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico is UNCONFIRMED at this time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About six hours after the initial tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/914258621327867905\">Krugman retracted his claim</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;OK, cholera not confirmed,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Conjunctivitis yes; lack of clean water (situation worsening, not improving) makes it a risk. But not certain.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>About half an hour before Krugman sent out his correction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/914249025263689728\">tweeted</a>, &quot;CDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Krugman&rsquo;s original tweet was shared over 14,000 times. The correction was retweeted 567 times (as of this writing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious about where this rumor came from and asked Krugman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said he saw it in a tweet from Kurt Eichenwald and &quot;was far too quick to assume it was validated.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurt Eichenwald, a liberal commentator and contributing editor to <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/913800760030384131\">tweeted on Sept. 29</a>, &quot;Cases of cholera now being reported in Puerto Rico. I can&rsquo;t believe this is America. We&#39;re too incompetent or uncaring to get them water?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That tweet was retweeted more than 13,000 times. We found no retraction by Eichenwald on Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warnings for the potential for cholera had been bouncing around the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of days before Krugman&rsquo;s tweet, the liberal information and political action website Daily KOS included and then retracted reports of the disease. &nbsp;The corrected headline for a Sept. 28 blog post said &quot;<a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/9/28/1702607/-SOS-Puerto-Rico-The-Suffering-Continues\">SOS Puerto Rico: The suffering continues; Update: Cholera cases possible (not confirmed)</a>.&quot; At the end of the post, was this note: &quot;An earlier version of this diary included a Tweet saying that cases of cholera had been reported. Given the facts of the ground &mdash; including, particularly, the lack of clean drinking water &mdash; this is definitely a possibility. &nbsp;Importantly, though, I have been unable to find confirmation of the information in that Tweet. I should not have posted it as fact, and have updated the title.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daily Beast had an article that underscored the potential for an eruption of cholera. Under the headline &quot;<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/outbreaks-begin-in-puerto-rico-while-trump-tweets-amazing-job\">Outbreaks begin in Puerto Rico while Trump tweets &lsquo;amazing job&rsquo;</a>,&quot; was&nbsp;the warning &quot;mayors and a top physician tell The Daily Beast the island faces deadly outbreaks of cholera and hepatitis unless the federal government surges help.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest tweet we found that declared that people had cholera in Puerto Rico came on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BiologistDan/status/913095002040958976\">Sept. 27</a> from a man in Boston who wrote, without any supporting evidence, that &quot;Reports of cholera already breaking out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservative websites took Krugman to task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/30/nyts-paul-krugman-falsely-blames-trumpie-for-non-existent-cholera-outbreak-in-puerto-rico/\">NYT&rsquo;s Paul Krugman falsely blames &lsquo;Trumpie&rsquo; for non-existent cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico</a>,&quot; read the Daily Caller&rsquo;s headline.
