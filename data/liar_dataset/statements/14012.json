Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has discussed the possibility of impeaching President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it was a bit of a surprise to hear her say she has &quot;not called for impeachment&quot; of Trump during a recent interview on MSNBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the backstory. On the morning of April 18, 2017, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxineWaters/status/854318909121581056\">tweeted</a>, &quot;The President is a liar, his actions are contemptible, &amp; I&#39;m going to fight everyday until he&#39;s impeached.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that day, when Waters sat for an <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5085698?8\">interview</a> with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-EAHXLS_Ss\">MSNBC&rsquo;s Craig Melvin</a>, the anchor read her tweet on air and asked her about it. Here&rsquo;s a portion of their exchange:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Melvin</strong>: &quot;You just started that by saying the question becomes, should we wait to call for impeachment until we have the answers to have that question...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Waters</strong>: &quot;Well, I have not...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Melvin</strong>: &quot;-- or some of the questions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Waters</strong>: &quot;-- I have not called for impeachment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Melvin</strong>: &quot;You said, &lsquo;I&#39;m going to fight every day until he&#39;s impeached.&rsquo; That&#39;s what you tweeted.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Waters</strong>: &quot;Yes, but here&#39;s what I&#39;ve said. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve said. I&#39;ve said that we need the information. We need to connect the dots. We need the facts in order to do the impeachment. And I&#39;m going to work every day to try and help get those facts and to reveal them to the republic, to our public until, of course, impeachment is taking place.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader asked us to look into Waters&rsquo; statement that &quot;I have not called for impeachment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that&rsquo;s not accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the interview on MSNBC, Waters seemed to draw a distinction between calling for impeachment and calling for investigations into matters that could lead to impeachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she has taken a more procedural approach at times, saying, for instance, during an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oPDJE1YeaQ\">April 2</a> CNN interview that &quot;we want to know about the hacking &hellip; and the interference with our elections. And I really want to know, because I know, if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable. A lot of people don&rsquo;t want to talk about that, but I do.&quot; (Waters&rsquo; office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, even if you grant that this distinction by Waters is valid, ample evidence exists showing Waters actually calling for impeachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, on Feb. 3, Waters gave an <a href=\"http://truepundit.com/maxine-waters-my-greatest-desire-is-to-lead-trump-right-into-impeachment-video/\">interview</a> on the streaming video channel Cheddar in which she said her &quot;greatest desire is to lead (Trump) right into impeachment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HzpfFlCY5LTeznr2pJFu8SZHR5h88BjsPPCiQbgmd2FKhrrIDFwW9FbySmdolACcXoBmp3FX2LanmUl9GlQ12nwvjurSYtbgWIste_3mLk2btLPXDnn_Qm06oGd2tQl6WhBSqJWE\" style=\"border:none; height:347px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, just three days before her appearance on MSNBC, Waters spoke at a rally on the Capitol grounds to demand that Trump release his tax filings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t respect this president,&quot; she told the crowd. &quot;I don&rsquo;t trust this president. He&rsquo;s not working in the best interests of the American people. &hellip; I will fight every day until he is impeached.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She then proceeded to start the crowd on a chant of &quot;Impeach 45,&quot; referring to Trump, the 45th president. The crowd responded to her invitation, and Waters led them by chanting &quot;Impeach 45&quot; three times. She then closed her speech saying, &quot;Go ahead: Impeach 45&quot; before exiting the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see Waters and the crowd chanting in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvnWM4kzIgw\">this video</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waters didn&rsquo;t seem to be hiding the fact that she had chanted &quot;Impeach 45.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same day she appeared on MSNBC, Waters retweeted a CNN video clip of her speaking and leading the chants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tmm9gpUmEtvWFNDOav7yV900DKhkALaX55ooi7WKR0vDyEYThTj30mZR5c1wsXT0BQu5E8quH0aYZRnQreKvmODrLxGlZ_s8EUZA620xtbGZXYQZan89vsJdkeC2es-OEUnttsjG\" style=\"border:none; height:394px; width:579px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waters said on MSNBC that &quot;I have not called for impeachment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has at times called for investigations that could lead to Trump&rsquo;s impeachment, rather than calling for impeachment directly. But on at least two occasions -- the Cheddar interview and the tax rally -- she did call for Trump&rsquo;s impeachment directly, in one case literally cheerleading for impeaching Trump at a rally at the U.S. Capitol. We rate her claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-19T16:29:08.584565", "ruling_date": "2017-04-19T16:49:39", "ruling_headline": "Maxine Waters wrong to say she has 'not called for' Trump's impeachment", "ruling_headline_slug": "maxine-waters-wrong-say-she-has-not-called-trumps-", "ruling_link_text": "She led a round of \"Impeach 45\" chants", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Maxine Waters, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-EAHXLS_Ss\">interview with MSNBC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5085698?8\">April 18, 2017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maxine Waters, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxineWaters/status/854318909121581056\">tweet</a>, April 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvnWM4kzIgw\">video</a> of Maxine Waters speaking at a Tax Day rally, April 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediaite, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/maxine-waters-leads-anti-trump-crowd-in-impeach-45-chant/\">Maxine Waters Leads Anti-Trump Crowd in &lsquo;Impeach 45&rsquo; Chant</a>,&quot; April 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/328979-waters-rallies-tax-march-crowd-for-trumps-impeachment\">Maxine Waters rallies Tax March crowd for Trump&#39;s impeachment</a>,&quot; April 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Caller, &quot;<a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/04/18/maxine-waters-falsely-denies-calling-for-trumps-impeachment-video/\">Maxine Waters Falsely Denies Calling For Trump&rsquo;s Impeachment [VIDEO]</a>,&quot; April 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True Pundit, &quot;<a href=\"http://truepundit.com/maxine-waters-my-greatest-desire-is-to-lead-trump-right-into-impeachment-video/\">Maxine Waters: &lsquo;My Greatest Desire&rsquo; Is to Lead Trump &lsquo;Right Into Impeachment&rsquo; (VIDEO)</a>,&quot; Feb. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "U.S. House of Representatives", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Maxine", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "California", "id": 3905, "last_name": "Waters", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "maxine-waters", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Maxine_Waters_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3905/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://waters.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I have not called for impeachment&quot; of President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on MSNBC", "statement_date": "2017-04-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "Maxine Waters wrong to say she has 'not called for' Trump's impeachment"}
