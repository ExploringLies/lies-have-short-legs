When there&rsquo;s a deficit, the government borrows money to cover the difference by selling treasury securities. Debt, meanwhile, is the net amount of accumulated deficits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s look at the two halves of the statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConor Sweeney, Ryan&rsquo;s budget committee spokesman, cited two reports:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tA <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/tables.pdf\">summary</a> of the fiscal 2012 federal budget, which shows revenue of $2.17 trillion and spending of $3.82 trillion. Sweeney divided the first figure by the second to show that 57 cents of every dollar the government spends comes from revenue, which means the other 43 cents are borrowed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tA June 2011 <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/122xx/doc12229/2011_05_MBR.pdf\">budget review</a> by the Congressional Budget Office which, using the same math, indicates 41 cents of every dollar spent is borrowed. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat puts Ryan&rsquo;s claim of 42 cents smack in the middle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur PolitiFact colleagues earlier in 2011 twice evaluated statements nearly identical to Ryan&rsquo;s, using the same approach Sweeney used. They rated both statements True, even though they were off by 3 cents. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo check the most recent data, we used the Treasury Department&rsquo;s May 2011 revenue and spending <a href=\"http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/mts0511.pdf\">report</a>, the latest available when Ryan did the radio interview. It indicates that, for the fiscal year to that point in time, the government borrowed 39 cents for every dollar it spends. Ryan is also within 3 cents of that figure, so we&rsquo;ll judge his first claim as essentially accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, to his second claim -- which is more complicated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;About half of (the borrowing) comes from countries like China&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy saying &quot;countries like China,&quot; Ryan meant borrowing the U.S. does from any foreign countries, according to Sweeney. So, for Ryan&rsquo;s second claim to be accurate, roughly half of the U.S. debt would have to be foreign owned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is no real dispute that the nation&rsquo;s total debt exceeds $14 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has twice used that figure in evaluating claims about the proportion of U.S. debt owned by China. In recent days, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/us/politics/13repubs.html?scp=2&amp;sq=%22%252414%20trillion%22&amp;st=cse\">cited</a> the current debt as $14.3 trillion and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, in a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-debt-primer-20110713,0,5064704.story\">primer</a> on the debt-limit talks, noted that the debt had reached that level in May 2011. Moreover, the <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It</a>, a daily debt tracking done by the Treasury Department, also shows the debt at $14.3 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, that figure just about equals the nation&rsquo;s debt limit -- which explains why there is urgency on the part of those who want to see the limit raised before what the Obama administration says is an Aug. 2, 2011 deadline.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut according to Sweeney, Ryan wasn&rsquo;t referring to that measure at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRather, he said, Ryan was pointing to a portion of the total debt, the far less known &quot;debt held by the public.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCiting a Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/119xx/doc11999/12-14-FederalDebt.pdf\">study</a>, Sweeney called that debt measure &quot;the most significant measure for economic purposes&quot; because it excludes treasury securities held by Social Security trust funds and other government accounts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe then pointed to the Treasury Department&rsquo;s daily debt tracking, which shows total debt at $14.3 trillion, including $9.74 trillion held by the public.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSweeney also cited a Treasury Department <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt\">report</a> which said foreign investment accounted for $4.49 trillion of U.S. debt as of April 2011. (China, by the way, was the top foreign debt owner, with $1.15 trillion.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the $4.49 trillion figure would mean that foreign investors own 46 percent of the debt held by the public, which is the proportion Ryan claimed -- but only 31 percent of the total debt, which is debt measure most familiar to most people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what&rsquo;s the bottom line?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview about raising the federal government&rsquo;s debt limit, Ryan made two claims in one statement: &quot;We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today and about half of that comes from countries like China.&quot; The first claim is essentially on the money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we believe Ryan owed his listeners more detail if he expected them to accept his second claim. It has long been widely reported that both the nation&rsquo;s debt and its debt limit are $14.3 trillion. And that&rsquo;s what the radio discussion was about. So when Ryan said that half of the nation&rsquo;s borrowing comes from foreign countries -- singling out China for emphasis -- his listeners would assume he meant half of the $14.3 trillion in total debt, not the much smaller debt measure he now says he was referring to, even if that second measure has strong merit in the debt limit discussion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Ryan&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-14T13:43:21.355244", "ruling_date": "2011-07-15T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP Rep.
