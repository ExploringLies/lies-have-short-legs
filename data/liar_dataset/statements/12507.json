Ron Johnson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After saying Wisconsinites talked about hot topics such as income inequality, paid family leave and Social Security, Feingold turned his attention to Johnson and college students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Finally, I didn&rsquo;t hear a single student in this state agree with Sen. Johnson&rsquo;s comment that students like to take out student loans because they think it&rsquo;s free money,&quot; said Feingold, a Democrat who lost to Johnson in 2010. &quot;Students don&rsquo;t like that. It&rsquo;s actually scary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The average debt coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like $28,000.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With in-state tuition ringing up at just over <a href=\"https://registrar.wisc.edu/tuition_&amp;_fees.htm\">$5,000 a semester</a>, we wondered if Feingold was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Behind the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked a similar claim about student debt from Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in 2014. She claimed that &quot;this generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they&rsquo;ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated her claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/04/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-claims-college-students-graduate-300/\">Half True</a>, as she didn&rsquo;t mention the data&rsquo;s limitations and some cases suggest the level may be lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For backup to Feingold&rsquo;s, his team sent us links to a <a href=\"https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/03/15/the-cost-of-knowledge-overwhelming-loan-debt-now-the-norm/\">few news articles</a> that cited the average debt incurred by students at UW-Madison. We reached out to the officials to confirm the numbers, which come from UW&rsquo;s Office of Student Financial Aid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent year for which statistics are available is 2014-15 and the average debt for students at the time of graduation that year was $28,769. That&rsquo;s slightly higher than the figure Feingold used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loans taken out by students through the university are tracked by the office through its Student Information System. Loans not borrowed at UW-Madison are fed into the system through the National Student Loan Data System, a student aid database from the U.S. Department of Education. Loans taken out by parents on behalf of students are not included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the number is a little over reaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When UW&rsquo;s Office of Student Financial Aid calculates the average debt of students, it only counts those who take out loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how many students are included?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the office, just about half of students at UW-Madison graduate with debt -- 3,374 of the 6,798 students who graduated in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we spread out the loans among all students, average debt would hover around $14,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think the best way to measure the amount of debt incurred is to examine only students who take out loans. And that tracks more closely with what Feingold said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another qualifier: The numbers doesn&rsquo;t take into account other ways students could be in debt -- credit cards, car loans, for instance. But that is impossible to track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the entire UW System, 73.5 percent of students borrow money, with the average debt at graduation for those students reaching $30,651.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold said the average student debt &quot;coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like 28,000 dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His number was on target, but he failed to mention the average only included about half of all students -- those who borrowed money for their educational expenses. The other half left with no debt at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold&rsquo;s statement is accurate, but needs additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s our definition of Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-13T12:47:16.199139", "ruling_date": "2016-06-17T07:19:25", "ruling_headline": "Russ Feingold says average UW-Madison student graduates with $28,000 in student debt", "ruling_headline_slug": "russ-feingold-says-average-uw-madison-student-grad", "ruling_link_text": "Some leave with no debt", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange with Meredith McGlone, director of news and media relations, University of Wisconsin-Madison, June 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WisconsinEye, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94WE1JO8Oj4\">Democratic party of Wisconsin State Convention - Day 1</a>, June 3, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/04/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-claims-college-students-graduate-300/\">Tammy Baldwin claims college students graduate with $30,000 in student loan debt</a>, June 4, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Michael Tyler, communications, Russ Feingold, June 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Badger Herald, <a href=\"https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/03/15/the-cost-of-knowledge-overwhelming-loan-debt-now-the-norm/\">The cost of knowledge: Average UW student graduates with nearly $30,000 in loan debt</a>, March 15, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Capital Times, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/writers/pat_schneider/student-loan-debt-at-uw-madison-rises-still-below-national/article_bb66adf9-5ff7-5e6e-ae95-aa9f4b442b2e.html\">Student loan debt at UW-Madison rises; still below national average</a>, Jan. 15, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Wisconsin-Madison, News release, <a href=\"http://news.wisc.edu/uw-madison-students-take-less-debt-than-national-average/\">UW-Madison students take less debt than national average</a>, Jan. 13, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Wisconsin System,<a href=\"https://www.wisconsin.edu/accountability/cost-and-efficiency/\"> Accountability dashboard, Cost and efficiency</a>, accessed June 10, 2016.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Russ ", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 528, "last_name": "Feingold", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "russ-feingold", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Russ_Feingold_Pfact_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/528/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.progressivesunited.org/about/russ-feingold"}, "statement": "<p>The average student debt &quot;coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like 28,000 dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2016-06-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "What is student debt picture for average UW-Madison grad?"}
