Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, has been making headlines in the last month pushing for Senate passage of the DISCLOSE Act, which would -- with some exceptions -- require special-interest groups to reveal the identities of their large donors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis Republican opponent, Barry Hinckley, has criticized Whitehouse, saying it&#39;s hypocritical to rail against the influence of special-interest groups such as political action committees (PACs) while taking their money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring a news conference in front of Whitehouse&#39;s Providence office, Hinckley wondered aloud &quot;how someone can take $2 million from the special interests when he&#39;s crying out against special-interest money in politics?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I agree [that] special-interest money is polluting politics,&quot; Hinckley said. &quot;Thirty percent of his money is coming from special interests. I&#39;ve taken 1 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if the 30-percent figure was accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHinckley&rsquo;s campaign told The Journal that the percentage came from OpenSecrets.org, the website of the nonprofit nonpartisan Center for Responsible Politics, which tracks political donations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked the website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt lists Whitehouse as <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=RIS1\">getting 29 percent of the $4.3 million</a> he has raised for the current campaign from political action committees. That&#39;s where Hinckley got his figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Hinckley said 30 percent is special-interest money, a category that includes more than just donations from PACs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTop officials from a variety of businesses, professionals (such as lawyers), labor unions and other groups also give money as individuals, hoping to foster their agendas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Hinckley campaign knows this. It released a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyQprGHbrtU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;hd=1\">YouTube video</a> in conjunction with the news conference, citing examples of &quot;Special Interest Money Given to Sheldon Whitehouse.&quot; The amounts in that ad total $4 million, not $2 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut defining <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/special%20interest\">special-interest</a> money isn&#39;t easy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder federal law, anyone who gives more than $200 in a federal race is asked to reveal his or her occupation and employer. OpenSecrets puts those donations in various donor categories, listed by &quot;industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the website, during Whitehouse&#39;s two Senate runs, he has collected more than $1.5 million from the &quot;lawyers and law firms&quot; industry; 91 percent of that money came from individuals. It&#39;s impossible to know which individual donors were pushing an agenda and which donors simply thought that Whitehouse, a fellow attorney, was a great guy to give money to.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert Biersack, senior fellow with the Center for Responsive Politics, argued that virtually all campaign donations might be considered special-interest money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly a tiny fraction of the public contributes to political campaigns and, he said, even with a small donor, &quot;they&#39;re looking for some policy outcome&quot; by supporting one particular candidate over another. &quot;It may not be on an economic question. It may be on a social issue. And the opportunity to get the ear of a member of the Senate is a pretty helpful thing whatever interest you may be pursuing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWendy Schiller, a professor of political science and public policy at Brown University, had a slightly less-strict assessment, saying that leeway should be given to smaller donors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Most, if not all, campaign money comes from special interests,&quot; including large donations from people who say they are retired, she said. &quot;I think anything over $250 is more orchestrated and typically more professional,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how much special-interest money has Whitehouse been getting?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you want to think of all PAC and large donations ($200 or more according to the way the feds classify them) as being special-interest money, 84 percent of the $4.3 million Whitehouse has raised for his campaign committee has come from special interests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(For Hinckley, it&#39;s 78 percent of the $1 million he has raised.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlternatively, OpenSecrets categorizes all donations of $200 or more -- from PACs and individuals -- by &quot;industry&quot; and lists the top 20.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cid=N00027533&amp;cycle=2012\">as of June 30, 2012</a>, Whitehouse had raised $4.3 million for his campaign committee. His top 20 &quot;industries&quot; gave him $3.1 million, or 72 percent. If all of that is special-interest money, that&#39;s much more than 30 percent. (The vast majority of the money -- 89 percent -- came from individuals.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat percentage could be higher because the list doesn&#39;t include smaller industry-related donations and some donations couldn&#39;t be placed into an &quot;industry&quot; category by OpenSecrets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe percentage could be lower if some of the donors don&#39;t have a special-interest agenda. But there&#39;s no way to determine that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said, &quot;30 percent of [Sheldon Whitehouse&#39;s campaign] money is coming from special interests.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf Hinckley was referring exclusively to political action committees, we would rate his statement True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut &quot;special-interest group&quot; is a broader -- if ill-defined -- category that includes lots of individual donors. By one rough estimate the amount could be 84 percent. By an even rougher estimate it could be 72 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHinckley&#39;s 30 percent figure is way off the mark, which makes him ineligible for a True reading on the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut our judges felt that, in this case, the data back up his point that Whitehouse is getting a significant amount of money from special interests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe will note, for the record, that while Hinckley is saying he has only gotten 1 percent of his money from special interests, the fact that 78 percent of his funds come from larger donors (not much different from Whitehouse&#39;s 84 percent) argues otherwise. A list of his donors by industry, we suspect, would also show a significant special-interest pattern, based on how Hinckley&#39;s campaign is defining special-interest money. However, OpenSecrets has not complied that list for Hinckley&#39;s donors because it doesn&#39;t have the resources to do every challenger, according to the organization.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause his statement has a significant element of truth but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"> Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> @politifactri</a>.
