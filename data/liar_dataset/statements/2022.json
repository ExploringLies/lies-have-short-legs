Jan Brewer rejected President  Barack Obama&rsquo;s claim that the White House had talked to police officers opposed  to Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law. She shook her head no and  said, &ldquo;Law enforcement in the state of Arizona supports Senate bill  1070,&rdquo; referring to the new law that directs police to question  individuals if they reasonably suspect they are in the U.S. illegally.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Later in the  interview, she said, &ldquo;We have many organizations and groups of the  officers on the ground that understand the problem, need another tool in  order to address the problem and support it wholeheartedly. And  everybody that I come across in law enforcement, other than a couple of  sheriffs in a couple of areas--other than that, you know, the majority  of law enforcement support the bill! So that&rsquo;s just a misrepresentation  again on behalf of the federal government!&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">She summed it up later  by saying of Obama&rsquo;s comments, &ldquo;the bottom line is that he&rsquo;s wrong&rdquo;  about law enforcement opposition to the bill.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> Listening to the  governor, you get the distinct impression that law enforcement  opposition to the bill is either non-existent or negligible. But, is  that accurate?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Brewer's office sent us a document listing those who favored and opposed the law,  which the Obama administration is now challenging in federal court.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Supporters include  groups representing police officers, such as the Phoenix Law Enforcement  Association, and the Arizona Police Association, which describes itself  as &ldquo;an association of associations, not an association of individual  members.&rdquo; Nonetheless, its website says that it &ldquo;represents nearly 9,000  federal, state and local law officers in the state of Arizona.&rdquo; The  governor&rsquo;s office notes that the two are the state&rsquo;s largest law  enforcement groups.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">The  same document noted, however, that the 140-member Arizona Association  of Chiefs of Police had spoken in opposition to the measure. The  document also noted that Gregg Stanton, Arizona&rsquo;s deputy attorney  general for legislation, policy, and strategic planning, had also  opposed the law. Attorney General Terry Goddard, the state&rsquo;s top law  enforcement official, is running for the Democratic nomination for  governor and will likely face Brewer as an opponent. His office has opposed the law.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">When the Obama  administration filed suit July 6 to block the law from taking effect, it  filed supporting declarations from the chiefs of police in Arizona&rsquo;s  two largest cities, Phoenix and Tucson, and from the sheriff of Santa  Cruz County, which includes Nogales, Arizona&rsquo;s largest town on the  Mexico border. All three opposed the measure. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">So, was Brewer right  to claim law enforcement support for the measure? She has numbers on her  side, because there are more rank and file officers than there are  chiefs of police. But to minimize the opposition as &ldquo;a couple of  sheriffs in a couple of areas,&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t convey the split in law  enforcement when it comes to the law. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">The police chiefs who filed  declarations supporting the Obama administration&rsquo;s attempt to block it  stressed their own concerns about illegal immigration. But when it came  to the new law, they expressed worry that it will stop undocumented  witnesses from coming forth in serious crimes, impose large new amounts  of work on police forces without additional compensation, invite  lawsuits against police departments and divert police from  focusing on crimes such as kidnappings and illegal drug smuggling. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Brewer suggests  unified support from police. Yes, there is support from two police  groups, but there&rsquo;s also opposition from police chiefs. We find her  claim Half True.</span><br /><br /><a href=\"http://gretawire.blogs.foxnews.com/page/9/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://www.azpolice.org/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/declaration-of-roberto-villasenor.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/declaration-of-tony-estrada.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/declaration-of-jack-harris.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"></a><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></span></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-08T15:12:02.431588", "ruling_date": "2010-07-08T16:59:45", "ruling_headline": "Jan Brewer says law enforcement supports Arizona's immigration law ", "ruling_headline_slug": "jan-brewer-says-law-enforcement-supports-arizonas-", "ruling_link_text": "Some do.
