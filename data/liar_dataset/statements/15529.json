Putnam touted his <a href=\"https://adamputnam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Secure-Florida-First-Agenda.pdf\">Secure Florida First Agenda</a>, which includes establishing a community deportation system with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In other words, Florida should have that relationship with ICE because Florida taxpayers are sick of paying tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens who ought to be in the custody of the feds and oughta be deported,&quot; Putnam <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamputnam/status/1005058459082125312\">said</a> June 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/23/donald-trump/does-immigration-policy-impose-300-billion-annuall/\">economic impact of immigration</a> is widely debated, so we wanted to take a look at Putnam&rsquo;s statement. We found it&rsquo;s uncertain how much money &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants in Florida prisons cost taxpayers. That&rsquo;s because Florida doesn&rsquo;t keep&nbsp;tabs on whether inmates are in the country legally or illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Flaws in Putnam&rsquo;s evidence</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Putnam campaign spokeswoman Meredith Beatrice said that there are two ways to calculate the &quot;tens of millions&quot; dollar figure he is referring to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem, though, is that his calculation for &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; includes inmates who are not U.S. citizens but are in the country legally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putnam&rsquo;s team multiplied the total state Department of Corrections budget ($2.3 billion) by the percent of &quot;criminal illegal aliens&quot; in Florida&rsquo;s prisons, which Putnam said was 4.8 percent. That 4.8 percent of Corrections budget is roughly $110 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second calculation, Putnam multiplied the average cost to incarcerate an inmate for a day ($55.80, according to the <a href=\"http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1617/FDC_AR2016-17.pdf\">Florida Department Of Corrections</a>) by the number of days in a year. Then he multiplied that total ($20,367) by the number of &quot;criminal illegal immigrants&quot; in Florida prisons, which he said was 4,754.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That works out to around $96.8 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But terminology matters. Putnam is referring to that 4,754 figure as all &quot;illegal aliens,&quot; but in fact the state prison system <a href=\"http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1516/stats/ip_alien.html\">labels them simply &quot;aliens.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That might sound like a small difference, but it isn&rsquo;t. The term &quot;aliens&quot; actually refers to all people who are not U.S. citizens, those who arrived both legally and illegally. The state of Florida only keeps a count of all aliens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Florida Department of Corrections, &quot;the vast majority of alien inmates&quot; are released to ICE for further immigration processing, including possible deportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s possible undocumented immigrants make up a good share of the &quot;alien&quot; population, but Putnam still would have no way of knowing the exact numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If the state of Florida doesn&rsquo;t track illegal immigrants in prison (they don&rsquo;t) then that number is not knowable,&quot; said Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem is that even if 4.8 percent of the prison population were released from the prison system, it does not mean it would have a direct 4.8 percent reduction on the total budget because of fixed costs, such as the cost to keep a prison running and administrative and security costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce Peterson, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said that reducing a small number of people from the prison will only really reduce the cost of clothing, food and direct health care service to that individual. &quot;If they were to release all 5 percent of those people that&rsquo;s probably not going to be enough to start laying off people and closing prison,&quot; Peterson said. &quot;It&#39;s unrealistic to think it&#39;s going to have a direct five percent impact on their total budget.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Putnam said Florida taxpayers &quot;pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putnam&#39;s estimates for how much&nbsp;undocumented immigrants in prisons cost Florida&nbsp;taxpayers have several major problems. For starters, the state only tracks inmates who are not U.S. citizens, without diving into whether they are in the country legally or illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if we had the right numbers, experts told us that fixed costs for the prisons mean reducing the population yields uncertain cost savings. Eliminating a small percentage of inmates doesn&rsquo;t mean the overall prison budget can be reduced by the same percentage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-25T11:56:19.358848", "ruling_date": "2018-06-26T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": " Do Florida taxpayers pay tens of millions of dollars a year on undocumented immigrants in prison?", "ruling_headline_slug": "do-florida-taxpayers-pay-tens-millions-dollars-yea", "ruling_link_text": "Florida doesn't track inmates by immigration status", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Meredith Beatrice, Putnam&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, June 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews with Michelle Glady, Florida Department of Corrections spokesperson, June 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Bryce Peterson, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, June 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Joshua Cochran, University of Cincinnati, School of Criminal Justice, June 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Alex Nowrasteh, senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, June 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, David Dyssegaard Kallick, director of immigration research at the Fiscal Policy Institute, June 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annual Report: Florida Department of Corrections, <a href=\"http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1617/FDC_AR2016-17.pdf\">2016-17</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/dec/06/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-says-illegal-immigration-costs-flori/\">PolitiFact Florida</a>, Vern Buchanan says illegal immigration costs Florida taxpayers $4 billion a year, Dec. 6, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/30/ritch-workman/workman-misquotes-immigration-report/\">PolitiFact Florida</a>, Workman misquotes immigration report, June 30, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/immigration-terms-and-definitions-involving-aliens\">IRS</a>, Immigration Terms and Definitions Involving Aliens, last updated Jan. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/\">PolitiFact</a>, Trump immigration claim has no data to back it up, July 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1516/stats/ip_alien.html\">Florida Department of Corrections</a>, Inmate Population, 2015-16</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Florida Commissioner of Agriculture", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Adam", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 192, "last_name": "Putnam", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "adam-putnam", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Putnam.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/192/", "total_count": 16, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.freshfromflorida.com/About/Meet-Commissioner-Putnam"}, "statement": "<p>Florida taxpayers &quot;pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview with Fox News", "statement_date": "2018-06-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
