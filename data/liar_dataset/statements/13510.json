According to a calculation by <a href=\"http://time.com/4587866/donald-trump-election-map/\"><em>Time </em>magazine</a>, Trump won 220 counties that had voted for Obama in 2012, while Hillary Clinton took far fewer -- 17 -- that had gone for Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Trump outperformed Romney&rsquo;s vote share in 2,728 counties, compared to just 383 where Clinton outperformed Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the places where Clinton performed better than Obama did were almost always in much more populous counties. According to Time&rsquo;s calculations, the counties where Clinton gained ground on Obama had a median of 75,554 voters in 2016. The comparable figure for the counties where Trump exceeded Romney&rsquo;s performance was 9,905 voters. So the median Clinton-trending county was more than seven times bigger than the median Trump-trending county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The divide doesn&rsquo;t stop at population. Mark Muro and Sifan Liu of the Brookings Institution <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/\">crunched the numbers</a> on the overall economic output of Clinton and Trump counties. Their finding? Clinton&rsquo;s comparatively tiny number of counties &quot;encompassed a massive 64 percent of America&rsquo;s economic activity,&quot; compared to 36 percent for Trump&rsquo;s much larger stable of counties. Here&rsquo;s a graphical representation of what they found, with Clinton counties in blue and Trump counties in red, and each county&rsquo;s rectangle scaled to the size of the output in that county:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6lcMUNpjbMJ1_TaRxHqxvd_PHFoKxeAN5a45sTiL3SQ95Uw1HUeOUEAWQnCmGLVJ8DVjSIdZpm1Neo1A5rhJaOyrb1iefcomqJFH7L4hqJ8myfMtxOaAm0TyL2aZJh20bkNUHRM_\" style=\"height:320px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Here you can see very clearly that with the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized county economy in the country,&quot; the authors wrote. &quot;Trumpland consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny low-output locations that comprise the non-metropolitan hinterland of America, along with some suburban and exurban metro counties.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this illustrates a general pattern for Democrats in recent election cycles: They have run strongly in populous and economically growing urban and suburban areas, but poorly in lightly populated rural areas. This has been true for the entire period we&rsquo;re looking at -- in fact, Bill Clinton never managed to win more counties during his two victories in the 1990s -- but the partisan disparity has been growing steadily. And the pattern reached a new apogee with the Trump vs. Clinton race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This helps explain why Clinton has so far <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/edit#gid=19\">won</a> 2.6 million more votes than Trump did -- almost 2 percentage points more -- while losing so many counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Loving County, Texas, has a population of 82, while California&rsquo;s Los Angeles County has over 9.8 million,&quot; said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. &quot;The number of counties won is not necessarily a meaningful indicator, absent any consideration of the population of these counties.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seth Masket, a University of Denver political scientist, agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Partisanship increasingly correlates with urbanism,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot more rural counties than urban ones, so I&#39;d expect Republicans to be winning more and more counties over time. So the claim that the GOP is winning more counties is possibly an interesting reflection on residential living patterns, but it doesn&#39;t really reflect what the voters wanted or what the government has a mandate to address.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence said that Trump &quot;won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The electoral results leave little doubt that Trump expanded Republican success compared to Romney&rsquo;s baseline in many corners of the country. However, it&rsquo;s important not to overstate the importance of the statistic Pence cited. Clinton may have won fewer counties overall, but the ones she did win tended to be much more populous and economically dynamic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate, but it needs an asterisk, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea7c6f37-927c-4edc-9de7-f78fd53257aa\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea7c6f37-927c-4edc-9de7-f78fd53257aa</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-04T15:08:54.795867", "ruling_date": "2016-12-04T17:54:39", "ruling_headline": "Mike Pence says Donald Trump won most counties by a Republican since Ronald Reagan", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-pence-says-donald-trump-won-most-counties-rep", "ruling_link_text": "He's right, but not so shocking", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mike Pence, interview on NBC&rsquo;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/\">Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections</a>, accessed Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brookings Institution, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/\">Another Clinton-Trump divide: High-output America vs low-output America</a>,&quot; Nov. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washingtpn Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/2016-election-results/us-presidential-race/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.09c820b0285a\">live results of election 2016</a>, accessed Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Wasserman, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/edit#gid=19\">National Popular Vote Tracker</a>, accessed Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em> Fix blog, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/15/thanks-to-a-bad-map-and-bizarre-math-breitbart-can-report-that-trump-won-the-real-popular-vote/?utm_term=.398bf6d549e2\">Thanks to a bad map and bizarre math, Breitbart can report that Trump won the REAL popular vote</a>,&quot; Nov. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Time </em>magazine, &quot;<a href=\"http://time.com/4587866/donald-trump-election-map/\">See a Map That Shows Exactly How Donald Trump Won</a>,&quot; Dec. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Dave Leip, creator of the &quot;<a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/\">Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections</a>,&quot; Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Costas Panagopoulos, Fordham University political scientist, Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Seth Masket, University of Denver political scientist, Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Alan Abramowitz, Emory University political scientist, Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steven Cheung, spokesman for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, Dec. 4, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Pence", "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 14, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "Indiana", "id": 124, "last_name": "Pence", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "mike-pence", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_VASH107_CAMPAIGN_2016_PE.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/124/", "total_count": 49, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm"}, "statement": "<p>Says Donald Trump &quot;won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\"", "statement_date": "2016-12-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Mike Pence says Donald Trump won most counties by a Republican since Ronald Reagan"}
