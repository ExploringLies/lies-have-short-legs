Nathan Deal has a new television ad out that says his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jason Carter, plans to go on a spending spree if elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s part of the GOP&rsquo;s strategy to paint Democrats as the tax-and-spend party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Jason Carter&rsquo;s plan: increase spending by $12.5 billion,&quot; the ad&rsquo;s narrator says at one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a head-turning forecast given that the state&rsquo;s annual budget is about $21 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact decided to review this one further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deal spokeswoman Jen Talaber said the governor&rsquo;s campaign developed the $12.5 billion projection based on Carter&rsquo;s pledges to restore full funding to k-12 education and expand Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School systems have not been fully funded by the state since 2003. That&rsquo;s become a major issue in this year&rsquo;s governor&rsquo;s race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Austerity cuts to education this year are about $747 million, and that&rsquo;s better than the recent past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talaber said the $12.5 billion forecast assumes that Carter will spend $1 billion a year in each of the next 10 years, $10 billion total, to fully restore education funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that also assumes Carter, if elected governor, would serve more than the two-term maximum (eight years) the law allows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, it assumes that the Legislature, now in Republican control, would follow his recommendation and approve the money every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, at least for next year, the $1 billion is off the mark. Although adjustments have to be made for factors such as enrollment growth, school systems would need about $747 million to be fully funded, based on the extra money put into education this year on Deal&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign does the same thing with its math for Georgia&rsquo;s cost to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It&rsquo;s $2.5 billion projection is for a decade, not a single year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That makes the figure disingenuous on its face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the number does exist, in a 2012 Kaiser Family Foundation study that focused on the ACA&#39;s Medicaid expansion plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If states sign up, the federal government pays all the costs for newly eligible enrollees in 2015 and 2016 and no less than 90 percent thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar state study projected the cost to be about $2.1 billion &ndash; still in the same general range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Missing from the spending claim: the $31 billion to $35 billion in federal money that will come back into Georgia under expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, Georgia&rsquo;s spending would create a 17-fold return on investment in actual dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state study projects the spending also would stimulate $65 billion in economic activity over the decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To say that the state is going to have to come up with $2.5 billion on its own is incorrect. There will be extra money coming back from the federal government,&quot; said William S. Custer, the author of the state report and director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deal has adamantly opposed expansion and say there&rsquo;s little reason to believe the debt-ridden federal government will continue to pay 90 percent of the costs far into the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further complicating the math, Georgia must spend some of the $2 billion projection, even without expansion, to meet ACA requirements. But without expansion, there is no counterbalance of federal money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, from a state budget standpoint, there also are areas where expansion could cut spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The studies don&rsquo;t count cost reductions in state-funded health care to those who are incarcerated or in some mental health programs, who could be transferred to an expanded Medicaid program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state has not done the calculations to determine the potential savings, which would likely need to be done on a case-by-case basis to determine Medicaid eligibility, said Timothy Sweeney, director of health policy at the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Sweeney said &quot;substantial savings&quot; could be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are serving these people already, with state funding,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;It&rsquo;s clear that transferring that service to federal funding would cut state costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those figures help prompt many health care leaders in Georgia to push for expansion. State lawmakers, though, backed Deal&rsquo;s stance that expansion would be a fiscal trap by passing House Bill 990 last spring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure requires the GOP-controlled General Assembly to approve any expansion of Medicaid &quot;through an increase in the income threshold.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves a loophole for Georgia to expand the program only via a loophole such as Arkansas did, by using the federal subsidy to buy private health care insurance, not Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That more or less leaves the fate of Medicaid expansion &ndash; and the potential costs &ndash; in the hands of the Legislature, not the governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad says Carter&rsquo;s plans will result in taxes on small businesses and the middle class, something Carter flatly denies. It calls Carter &quot;silver tongued&quot; and &quot;untrustworthy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter says additional funding for education will come from cuts in government waste, recovery of delinquent taxes and economic growth. That&rsquo;s typical campaign banter. (We&rsquo;ve ruled <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2014/sep/23/jason-carter/carters-plan-go-after-tax-cheats-has-challenges/\">Half True</a> a claim by Carter that education funding can be increased significantly if the state goes after $2.5 billion in delinquent taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the ad claim that Carter&rsquo;s plan will cost $12.5 billion?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those cost projections cannot be taken seriously. They are for a period of 10 years -- longer than Carter could legally be in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They leave out other critical facts -- like lawmakers would have to sign off on any major spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the ad claim as False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-17T16:31:14.809686", "ruling_date": "2014-10-20T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Deal attack ad misfires on claim Carter will spend billions", "ruling_headline_slug": "deal-attack-ad-misfires-claim-carter-will-spend-bi", "ruling_link_text": "Education spending a major campaign theme", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Political <a href=\"http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/10/06/with-four-weeks-left-nathan-deal-launches-bruising-tv-attack-on-jason-carter/\">Insider </a>blog, &quot;With four weeks left, Nathan Deal launches bruising TV attack on Jason Carter,&quot; Oct. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study, Healthcare Georgia Foundation, The <a href=\"http://www.healthcaregeorgia.org/uploads/file/Georgia_Medicaid_Economic_Impact.pdf\">Economic</a> Impact of Medicaid Expansion in Georgia, February 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Budget &amp; <a href=\"http://gbpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cover-Georgia1.pdf\">Policy</a> Institute, &quot;The Dollars and Sense of Expanding Medicaid in Georgia,&quot; February 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Jen Talaber, Deal spokeswoman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Bryan Thomas, Carter spokesman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review of state Department of Education records on austerity cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review of state budget records, Governor&#39;s Office of Planning and Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study, Kaiser Commission on Medicaid<a href=\"http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8384.pdf\"> and</a> the Uninsured: The Cost and Coverage Implications of the ACA Medicaid Expansion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Legislature, 2013-2014 Session, House Bill <a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20132014/HB/990\">990,</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, William Custer, director, Center for Health Services Research, Georgia State University, Oct. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email and phone interview with Timothy Sweeney, director of health policy, Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, Oct. 15 and Oct. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Nathan", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "", "id": 441, "last_name": "Deal", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "nathan-deal", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NathanDeal.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/441/", "total_count": 52, "true_count": 13, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p><strong>&quot;Jason Carter&rsquo;s plan: increase spending by $12.5 billion.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "television attack ad", "statement_date": "2014-10-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 212, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/212/", "subject": "Medicaid", "subject_slug": "medicaid", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
