Pricey Harrison of Greensboro recently tweeted statistics that emphasize America&rsquo;s obsession with guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The US has approximately 5% of the world&#39;s population and 42% of civilian gun ownership,&quot; Harrison <a href=\"https://twitter.com/priceyharrison/status/964309974649274368\">tweeted</a> on Feb. 15. She has about 4,000 Twitter followers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She continued: &quot;We must change the gun culture to gun violence prevention. NC Dems have filed comprehensive gun safety bills repeatedly since the Sandy Hook tragedy w/zero movement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s roughly correct about the United States accounting for 5 percent of the world&rsquo;s population, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. Experts agree that Americans have more guns than citizens of any other country in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, globally speaking, is Harrison right about the United States&rsquo; share of gun ownership?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10-year-old stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>She cited a story on Vox.com &ndash; &quot;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/21/17028930/gun-violence-us-statistics-charts\">America&rsquo;s gun problem, explained in 5 facts</a>&quot; &ndash; as the source for her tweet. Vox, for its part, cites a <a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2007/en/full/Small-Arms-Survey-2007-Chapter-02-EN.pdf\">2007 study</a> by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;... in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world&rsquo;s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people,&quot; the writer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/germanrlopez\">German Lopez</a>, explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world&rsquo;s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world&rsquo;s privately held firearms,&quot; Lopez wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Switzerland-based group actually offered a less specific estimate. On page 46 of the survey itself, the group estimated that the United States is home to &quot;roughly 35-50 percent&quot; of the world&rsquo;s civilian-owned guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lopez, for his part, told PolitiFact that he split the difference in the range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s pretty typical in research to just take the average of a range,&quot; he said. &quot;So the range here is 35-50. If you take the average of this, it lands at about 42. That&#39;s with a margin of error of about 7.5, obviously, but it&#39;s just a shorthand for what the research finds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Small Arms Study from 2007 remains the most comprehensive research private gun ownership worldwide, said Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama and author of the widely-cited study &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26822013\">Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries</a>,&quot; published in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Small Arms Study is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva that&rsquo;s supported by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as donations from other governments. The project compiles data using a &quot;worldwide network&quot; of researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lankford agreed with Lopez&rsquo;s methodology. If you take the survey&rsquo;s average total of civilian firearms in the U.S. (270 million) and compare that with the survey&rsquo;s average total globally (645 million), you get 41.8 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Guns are hard to track</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2009 National Institute of Justice report found the number of civilian-owned guns in the United States to be about 310 million, but didn&#39;t provide comparable global data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, one of the world&rsquo;s leading nonpartisan research firms, recently published a <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/americas-complex-relationship-with-guns/\">study on guns in America</a> that found 42 percent of Americans live in a household with a gun. But the center hasn&rsquo;t collected data from other countries, &quot;so we can&rsquo;t compare our US gun data to the rest of the world,&quot; spokeswoman Haley Nolan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governments don&rsquo;t track firearms across the board. And many surveys rely on people to self-report guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We only have a rough guess of what there is in the U.S. We have no idea how many guns are in South America,&quot; said Philip J. Cook, professor of public policy studies at Duke University and co-author of the book &quot;Gun Violence: The Real Costs.&quot; &nbsp;South America has a lot of guns that were bought underground, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the ballpark?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/david-hemenway/\">David Hemenway</a>, professor of health policy at Harvard University and author of the book &quot;Private Guns, Public Health,&quot; agreed that global estimates are squishy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s very, very hard,&quot; Hemenway said. The best way to estimate the number of firearms in each country would be to have every country track guns that are bought and sold, he said. &quot;Even then, you only get the legal guns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, he thinks Harrison&rsquo;s claim is generally accurate compared to other estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That sort of number is thrown around all the time,&quot; Hemenway said. &quot;It&rsquo;s pretty high validity. This seems to be in the ballpark of the figures I&rsquo;ve seen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harrison said that the United States has approximately 5 percent of the world&#39;s population and 42 percent of civilian gun ownership. Those numbers are based on a study that&rsquo;s now 10 years old. And experts say tracking guns is very difficult. But Harrison&rsquo;s claim is on roughly par with the information available. We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-05T15:31:40.059764", "ruling_date": "2018-03-05T15:27:33", "ruling_headline": "Does America own 42 percent of the world's guns?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-america-have-42-percent-worlds-guns", "ruling_link_text": "The guns we know about", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email correspondence with state <a href=\"https://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/members/membersByDistrict.pl?sChamber=H&amp;nDistrict=57\">Rep.
