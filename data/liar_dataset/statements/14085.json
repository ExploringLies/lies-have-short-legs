The <em>New York Times</em> had reported the network paid about $13 million to settle claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The confrontation turned aggressive when the liberals (as identified in the story) attacked O&rsquo;Reilly, dragging him into the street and kicking him until &quot;until he was unconscious and bleeding.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attackers ran off, the post said, leaving O&rsquo;Reilly with four broken ribs and a punctured lung. He possibly suffered &quot;a cardiac event,&quot; the story said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except none of the details about an attack are true.
