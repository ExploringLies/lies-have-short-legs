If you are getting shot or doing the shooting, overwhelmingly you&#39;ve been involved in the criminal justice system and the correctional system is not correcting.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey was also startled by the data. So, we researched Booker&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNewark spokeswoman Anne Torres said Booker&rsquo;s &quot;statement should have been shot and killed, instead of shot,&quot; but beyond that he&rsquo;s right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statistics come from a study Anthony Braga, a professor with Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice is conducting, as a program called &quot;Operation Ceasefire&quot; is implemented in Newark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, along with Braga and Anne Piehl, a Harvard professor at the time, implemented Ceasefire in Boston in 1996, with the city&rsquo;s police department. The strategy aims to reduce gun violence through targeted law enforcement efforts, social services outreach and community interaction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThough Braga&rsquo;s study is not yet completed or published, Braga said he briefed Booker and his staff on the progress of his research on homicides and nonfatal shootings in the city.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The exact numbers are... 85% of 165 murder victims in Newark between 2009 and 2010 were known to the criminal justice system before they were killed (&quot;known&quot; meaning that they were arrested at least once before the homicide event),&quot; Braga wrote in an email. And those &quot;victims, had, on average, 10 prior arrests on their criminal records.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBraga said he determined those figures by running the names and dates of birth of the homicide victims through the state&rsquo;s database of criminal history files.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKennedy said that pattern of violence is not unique to Newark. &quot;This is the way the streets work,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea that ordinary people kill each other is nearly never true.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The folks who pick up a gun and kill another human being are the exception, even within an active criminal population and they almost always kill people in their same social networks. So they&rsquo;re killing each other, in effect. Contrary to what a lot of people think, this stuff is not random. It&rsquo;s not stranger on stranger,&quot; said Kennedy. &quot;It&rsquo;s people that know each other.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBooker said &quot;if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you&#39;ve been arrested before an average of 10 times.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mayor should have said shot and killed, but the rest of his statistic is on point -- and backed by the research of a Rutgers-Newark criminal justice professor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/politifact_nj_cory_booker_cite.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-21T15:10:14.706651", "ruling_date": "2011-10-24T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Cory Booker says Newark shooting victims have high chance they\u2019ve been arrested an average of 10 times", "ruling_headline_slug": "cory-booker-says-newark-shooting-victims-have-high", "ruling_link_text": "Shot and killed, not just shot", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWBGO, <a href=\"http://www.wbgo.org/internal/mediaplayer/?podcastID=1485&amp;type=newarktoday\">Newark Today</a>, Oct. 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and email interview with Anne Torres, spokeswoman for the <a href=\"http://www.ci.newark.nj.us/\">City of Newark</a>, Oct. 17 &amp;18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Anthony Braga, professor at <a href=\"http://www.newark.rutgers.edu/rscj/\">Rutgers University&rsquo;s School of Criminal Justice</a>, Oct. 19 &amp;
