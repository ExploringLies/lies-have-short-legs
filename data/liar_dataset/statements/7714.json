I don&rsquo;t think they do,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe had to know: Do new Medicare billing guidelines include &quot;nine codes for turkeys&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Outdated codes</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst, a little background about this code thing. It&rsquo;s not just a U.S. system &mdash; it&rsquo;s international.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(And in case you were wondering, it has nothing to do with Obamacare.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe &quot;new&quot; set of diagnosis codes that Poe talked about is known as <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/Downloads/ICD10FAQs.pdf\">ICD-10</a>. &quot;ICD&quot; stands for &quot;International Classification of Diseases.&quot; It&rsquo;s published by the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/\">World Health Organization</a>, then adapted for use in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe United States now uses ICD-9, which is more than three decades old.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDoctors&rsquo; offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims, among other things. Their billing and practice management software is based on them. Their employees are trained to use them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/washington/icd10-opposition-letter-17jan2012.pdf\">American Medical Association says</a> that depending on the size of the medical practice, it&rsquo;ll cost $83,290 to more than $2.7 million to switch.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDoctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes, the association has <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/washington/icd-10-comment-letter-10may2012.pdf\">begged since 2011</a> to delay or give up on the switch altogether.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther countries have charged ahead.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey started to adopt the &quot;new&quot; set of codes nearly 20 years ago, and most developed countries now use it, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/Downloads/ICD10SmallMediumPracticeHandbook.pdf\">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCMS will require American doctors, indeed, any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA, to switch by Oct. 1, 2014.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe federal government says the United States <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/factsheet.asp?Counter=3407&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=2&amp;srchType=2&amp;numDays=0&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=icd%252D10&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=6&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=1&amp;pYear=&amp;year=0&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date\">needs to upgrade</a> partly because ICD-9 has outdated medical terms and <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/Downloads/ICD10SmallMediumPracticeHandbook.pdf\">not enough detail</a> for accurate claims processing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tClaims for two different injuries might seem like duplicate filings if you couldn&rsquo;t specify <a href=\"http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_049803.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_049803\">right vs. left hand</a>, for example.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs Poe suggested, the new system does have far more diagnosis codes than the version developed in the 1970s &mdash; 68,000 instead of 13,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Poe, in his Stossel interview, said the new system has 140,000 codes, but that&rsquo;s only if you group both diagnosis and procedure codes &mdash; not a direct comparison with 13,000.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow much detail are we talking?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe codes allow doctors to specify not just injuries from turkeys, but from parrots, macaws, ducks and geese.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s a different code for being &quot;struck&quot; vs. &quot;pecked&quot; or suffering from &quot;other contact&quot;&mdash; with specification for the first time, an unlucky repeat or even worse, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/sequela\">sequela</a>.&quot; (That would be some &quot;negative afteraffect&quot; resulting from your turkey encounter.

His office pointed us to the new codes, which will be required for Medicare claims by October 2014. Indeed, if your Thanksgiving tradition takes a tragic turn that year, your doctor will be able to describe it in seven-digit detail. (We hope it&rsquo;s just W61.42XA and not W61.43XS.)
