The asteroid in question, 2016 NF23, is on that list.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to that database, the asteroid is predicted to be closest to the Earth on Aug.&nbsp;29, 2018. It will be travelling at 20,000 miles per hour, or about 5 and a half miles per second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database also says the asteroid is estimated to be 70 meters to 160 meters in diameter, or about 75 to 175 yards. That&rsquo;s roughly the size of a soccer field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s actually no reason to worry about 2016 NF23. That&rsquo;s because even at its point of closest approach to the Earth, the asteroid will be more than 3 million miles away (or, a lot of soccer fields). That&rsquo;s more than 13 times the distance between the Earth and its moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;From an astronomical perspective, that may be close, but from a human perspective, it&rsquo;s obviously not very close at all; the asteroid is certainly not &lsquo;skimming&rsquo; past the Earth, as the story claims,&quot; said Paul Chados, the manager of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, in an interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added, &quot;In no way is our prediction a &lsquo;warning,&#39;&nbsp;as the story intimates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wakefield Express is also incorrect in saying that 2016 NF3 &quot;has been labelled &#39;potentially hazardous&#39;&quot; by NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Chamberlin, a senior engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told PolitiFact, &quot;The object is not classified as a PHA (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid) as defined in our <a href=\"https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/neo_groups.html\">CNEOS website</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because the asteroid has too high of an absolute magnitude (a measurement for determining how bright asteroids appear) and is too small of an object to be considered a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Chados and Chamberlin suggested that the article was misleading and recommended that readers who are concerned about asteroids and other objects possibly striking the Earth&nbsp;look at NASA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/\">Sentry page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the close approach database, the Sentry page only lists asteroids &quot;that have even the slightest chance of colliding with our planet over the next century or two,&quot; as Chados put it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wakefield Express did not respond to a request for comment sent to the editorial email listed on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/contact-us\">Contact Us page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline on the website Wakefield Express claimed that &quot;NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA has indeed confirmed a large asteroid is heading in the direction of Earth.
