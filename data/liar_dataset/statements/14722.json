It said Kelley was &quot;an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by &lsquo;targeting white conservative churches&rsquo; and causing anarchy in the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also said he &quot;was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers &lsquo;this is a communist revolution&rsquo; before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of those details have been confirmed by law enforcement agencies, or reported by reputable media outlets. Authorities said their initial investigation showed the attack was likely motivated by a family dispute, and not a broader movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story was an incomplete copy of a <a href=\"http://yournewswire.com/texas-church-shooter-antifa/\">longer post on fake news website YourNewsWire.com</a>, which attributed many of its assertions to Kelley&rsquo;s alleged Facebook profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Devin Kelley&rsquo;s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included &lsquo;Civil and social rights&rsquo; and &lsquo;Civil rights&rsquo; as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons,&quot; the post read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YourNewsWire.com claimed that they had Facebook images of Kelley and an AR-15-style rifle, although there was no indication it was the <a href=\"http://www.ruger.com/products/ar556/models.html\">Ruger AR-556 rifle</a> police have reported finding at the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could not find a Facebook profile for Kelley, so we could not independently verify the content of his alleged profile. The <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/11/06/who-is-devin-patrick-kelley-gunman-who-officials-say-killed-churchgoers-in-sutherland-springs/?utm_term=.fda38b04f8d8\">Washington Post</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-texas-church-shooting-20171105-htmlstory.html\">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, among others, reported that the profile with those photos had been taken down shortly after the shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top of the YourNewsWire.com story contained the two images, plus a third of an Antifa flag. Antifa United debunked the use of the flag image in a Facebook post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s go ahead and lay this to rest right now. The far-right (badly) put together a collage of images/mock up of a FB profile and are claiming the Texas shooter uploaded a picture of his antifa flag.
