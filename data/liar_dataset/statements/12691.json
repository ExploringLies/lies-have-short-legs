Just how popular is college basketball in North Carolina?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some alumni of UNC, Duke, Wake Forest and N.C. State may be surprised to learn that not all North Carolinians are crazy for college hoops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/NCCulturalPoll.pdf\">a poll taken just before last season</a> by Public Policy Polling, 52 percent of North Carolinians consider themselves college basketball fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another PPP poll commissioned in early July by MomsRising and other groups that mostly focused on paid leave &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/07/NCToplines1.pdf\">the same poll</a> their Twitter claim referenced &ndash; college basketball received 53 percent support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet even just two years prior, in 2013, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/08/a-new-north-carolina-tobacco-and-moonshine-relics-of-the-past.html\">59 percent of North Carolina respondents</a> told PPP they were college basketball fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other polls have documented the sport&rsquo;s declining popularity nationwide. Gallup, for instance, found that while the number of fans didn&rsquo;t drop <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/4735/sports.aspx\">between 2001 and 2012</a>, the number of people saying they were definitely not fans (as opposed to on the fence) has grown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And <a href=\"http://www.theharrispoll.com/sports/Americas_Fav_Sport_2016.html\">according to the Harris Poll</a>, college basketball was perhaps at its height in 1989, when 10 percent of Americans said it was their favorite sport. In 2015, that number was 4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time Magazine <a href=\"http://time.com/3744860/march-madness-selection-sunday-college-basketball/\">analyzed the sport&rsquo;s declining popularity</a> last year and attributed it to a number of factors, including low scoring, conference realignment that ended some popular rivalries, and a schedule that forces it to compete for attention with both college and professional football.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Support for paid leave</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s now take a break to watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyCrrahigMM\">some</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKI9dGHxL_A\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7woZs4yTRU\">our</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhgYXcpGB5k\">favorite</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K3UJUmHREQ\">college</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQZkq726WYE\">basketball</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoVM9nm42E\">moments</a>, then get back to the subject at hand: paid leave policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to one <a href=\"http://ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_242615.pdf\">United Nations study</a> of 170 countries, only the U.S. and the tiny Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea don&rsquo;t require paid family leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has previously checked several people claiming the U.S. is lagging behind the rest of the world in its paid leave policies; it was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-every-other-major-country-has-/\">particularly popular with Bernie Sanders</a> during his run for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could be expensive. PolitiFact&rsquo;s &quot;Obameter,&quot; which tracks promises made by the president, noted that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/100/provide-a-1-5-billion-fund-to-help-states-launch-/\">he has failed in his promise</a> to spend $1.5 billion to start paid family and medical leave in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In North Carolina, the poll from Public Policy Polling that MomsRising commissioned found 49 percent of people strongly favor paid family leave&nbsp;and another 19 percent somewhat favor it, for a total of 68 percent support. To jog your memory, college basketball has recently been polling about 15 percentage points lower than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know the partisan breakdown of this poll, but in national polls, paid leave typically has bipartisan support &ndash; although moreso among liberals &ndash; and among politicians, it&rsquo;s far more popular among Democrats than Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of that, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the poll in question was paid for by a&nbsp;liberal group&nbsp;pushing for more paid leave policies, and that Public Policy Polling is itself a liberal-leaning organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So take these numbers with a grain of salt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unfortunately, there has been little to no other statewide polling on the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling &ndash; which does polls for private clients as well as for public distribution &ndash; has never before asked about paid family leave in a public poll.&nbsp;Similarly, we weren&rsquo;t able to find any other statewide polling on the subject (although if you know of any, please let us know).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But nationally, the polling does mirror what PPP found in North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, <a href=\"http://ap-gfkpoll.com/featured/findings-from-our-latest-poll-15\">an AP-GfK poll</a> found two-thirds of Americans supported paid family leave &ndash; about the same as the recent North Carolina poll, but lacking the political biases, and an AP-NORC poll two months ago&nbsp;found 75 percent support among people age 40 and older.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/03/business/income-inequality-workers-rights-international-trade-poll.html\">New York Times-CBS poll</a>, in 2015, found 80 percent support for paid family leave nationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MomsRising said that &quot;paid family leave is more popular than college basketball&quot; in North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is little polling on this topic at the state level, but what there is does line up with national polling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since data is sparse but does support the claim,&nbsp;we rate it&nbsp;Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0963b149-97d8-405c-b3e4-2bc010444fab\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0963b149-97d8-405c-b3e4-2bc010444fab</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-15T10:59:46.513926", "ruling_date": "2016-07-15T10:45:37", "ruling_headline": "Is paid family leave more popular than college basketball in North Carolina?", "ruling_headline_slug": "paid-family-leave-more-popular-college-basketball-", "ruling_link_text": "College ball's popularity is surprisingly low", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, Oct. 14, 2015, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-every-other-major-country-has-/\">&quot;Bernie Sanders says &#39;every other major country&#39; has family paid leave except United States&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, The Obameter: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/100/provide-a-1-5-billion-fund-to-help-states-launch-/\">&quot;Provide a $1.5 billion fund to help states launch programs for paid family and medical leave&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MomsRising/status/753298955996368896  \">MomsRising post</a>, July 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling, August 2013, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/08/a-new-north-carolina-tobacco-and-moonshine-relics-of-the-past.html\">&quot;A New North Carolina: Tobacco and moonshine relics of the past&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling, July 2016, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2016/07/NCToplines1.pdf \">polling for MomsRising on paid leave, basketball and other topics</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling, September 2015, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/NCCulturalPoll.pdf\">2015 N.C.
