So far, her toughest battle is not  with the incumbent, John Eaves, but getting on the Nov. 2 ballot.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">&ldquo;Georgia has the most  restrictive ballot access laws in the country,&rdquo; Norwood, a former  two-term Atlanta city councilwoman, said during a television interview  Tuesday evening.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">That  claim was too juicy for PolitiFact Georgia to resist checking out.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">We began by asking the  Norwood camp for details. Anne Fauver, her campaign manager, explained.  Georgia requires independent candidates running for countywide offices  to get at least 5 percent of all registered voters eligible to vote in  the last election in that jurisdiction to sign a petition supporting  their placement on the ballot.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how restrictive it was in  comparison to other states,&rdquo; said Fauver, who served with Norwood on the  City Council.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Norwood  needs about 22,700 signatures to get on the ballot. Thus far, she is  &ldquo;more than halfway&rdquo; to her goal, Fauver said. Norwood has until July 13  to reach the magic number.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Norwood has taken Eaves to court over what  she calls a &ldquo;hypertechnical interpretation&rdquo; of the law to discount about  3,000 of the signatures she has collected. The Eaves campaign says each  petition signer must write &ldquo;Fulton,&rdquo; along with their address, on the  form. Norwood says Fulton election officials told her she could pre-type  &ldquo;Fulton&rdquo; on the form. A judge dismissed Norwood&rsquo;s complaint on this  point Thursday, saying, in part, that any ruling before the deadline  &ldquo;would constitute an advisory opinion.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">As for the 5 percent  rule, we reached out to Richard Winger, the California-based editor of  Ballot Access News. He has studied ballot issues for more than four  decades. Winger was called a &ldquo;savant&rdquo; on the topic by Columbia  University professor Nate Persily and &ldquo;the nation&rsquo;s encyclopedia on this  stuff&rdquo; by Capital University Law School professor Bradley Smith.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">&ldquo;That is the toughest  such law in the country,&rdquo; Winger said of Georgia.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Until 1943, any  political party could gain across-the-board ballot access by registering  a slate of officers with the secretary of state. State leaders changed  the system that year, primarily to discourage Communist Party candidates  from getting on the ballot, Winger said. Some Southern states also used  such rules to ensure that a white candidate would win, Smith said.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">The laws gradually  changed over the years for some offices, Winger said. Statewide  independent candidates now need the signatures of 1 percent of  registered voters to get on the ballot. The rules stayed the same for  independent candidates seeking a municipal or countywide office, or  seats in Congress or the Georgia Legislature.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Why hasn&rsquo;t the law  changed? For some reason, Winger said, state lawmakers couldn&rsquo;t agree in  the 1980s on several proposed bills that would have made it easier for  people to get on the ballot to potentially run against them.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">A bill that would have  removed the requirement that independent candidates gather signatures  on a petition to run for office did not pass earlier this year.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Winger ranks North  Carolina as having the second-most-restrictive ballot access guidelines  for independent countywide candidates. The Tar Heel State requires those  candidates to get the signatures of 4 percent of registered voters in  the county to get on the ballot. Winger ranked Illinois as third, but  it&rsquo;s worth noting that state also requires independent countywide  candidates to get 5 percent of the signatures of voters who cast ballots  in the 2008 election.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">As for her claim on Georgia&rsquo;s rules about  ballot access, the Peach State and Illinois both have similar ballot  access guidelines.
