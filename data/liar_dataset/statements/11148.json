Today, there are less than 30,000.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Hanna&rsquo;s claim about the lion population was true. Has the population really shrunk by&nbsp;more than 90 percent in 68 years, and if so, why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to counting lions, accurate numbers are almost as elusive as the animals themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1940s</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most scientists and researchers agree that the number of lions in the wild is in decline.&nbsp;The Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as &quot;vulnerable&quot; on its threat scale, just one level below &quot;endangered.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the speed of the decline that is in dispute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson for Hanna said he was citing loose figures from the National Geographic Society&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Big Cats Initiative</u></a>. The organization&rsquo;s page on lions <a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/lion-decline-map/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>estimates</u></a> that there were around 450,000 African lions in the 1940s, 100,000 in the 1980s, and 20,000 today &mdash; almost exactly mirroring what Hanna said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other research questions some of Hanna&#39;s figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&nbsp;claimed more than 450,000 lions roamed the savannahs in the 1940s, but&nbsp;detailed studies of the population weren&rsquo;t conducted back then. That means data for that period is virtually nonexistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Susie Weller, a spokeswoman for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.panthera.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Panthera</u></a>, another big cats advocacy group, cited her organization&rsquo;s own estimate that there were already as few as 200,000 &quot;over a century ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, no one really knows how many lions there were in the 1940s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You might even see numbers in the millions,&quot;&nbsp;said Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University and a contributor to the Big Cats Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1970s</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanna then claimed there were 100,000 lions in the wild during the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No empirical data exists for that time either,&nbsp;not that scientists haven&#39;t tried to make a best guess.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996, a team of researchers employed land-use data to predict there were around 75,800 lions in 1980. The study, which was not published, is widely cited and&nbsp;was conducted at Cranfield University&rsquo;s International Eco Technology Research Centre in the United Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pimm said that this strategy was one of the more reliable ways to estimate the size of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What we can consider,&quot; he said, &quot;is how much lion habitat there was back then, and then approximate how many lions fit into that area. But if you&rsquo;re going to put a number on it, you have to be careful to couch it in very, very approximate terms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The geographic analysis is the closest anyone has come to a population count for that time, and it&rsquo;s a rough guess at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason Riggio, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Davis and the author of a study on lion populations, said the 1980 number &quot;arguably should not be cited as fact&quot; because it doesn&rsquo;t take into account expert opinions or survey data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanna&rsquo;s claim that there were 100,000 lions left in the 1970s isn&rsquo;t far off from the closest estimate for that decade, yet isn&rsquo;t based on any convincing data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Today</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanna was more on target when he said there &quot;are less than 30,000&quot; lions left in the wild today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A widely used figure for the present population comes from the 2012 <a href=\"http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0381-4/fulltext.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">study</a> led by Riggio. The paper, which combines data from two counts in the early 2000s, puts the population &quot;between 32,000 and 35,000.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other organizations cited the<strong> </strong>IUCN&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Red List of Threatened Species</a> as an authoritative source for species population numbers and trends. The Red List questions Riggio&rsquo;s numbers, arguing that, among other issues, his team&rsquo;s use of older figures ignored downward trends that may have taken place in some regions. &quot;We have greater confidence in the estimate of fewer than 20,000 lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15951/0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reads the group&rsquo;s file on lions</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Hanna&rsquo;s claim that there are fewer than 30,000&nbsp;lions left in the wild today is within the range of these two estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lions, Pimm said said, stake out in some of the most unforgiving natural habitats in the world, making them hard to locate, spot&nbsp;and count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are roughly 30,000 lions in Africa,&quot; said Pimm, &quot;and they&rsquo;re spread out over a massive area. People just don&rsquo;t realize how big the continent really is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some researchers in the field, including Riggio, are reluctant to mention specific numbers for the changing lion population given the problematic data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the experts agreed that Hanna&#39;s general point about a massive decline in the species is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The threat lions pose to farms means that &quot;they are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa,&quot; according to the IUCN, and growth in the bushmeat market has led to a decrease in the abundance of their prey.&nbsp;While hunters claim that trophy hunting in small numbers is a valuable way to finance conservation, the IUCN has reported an unsustainable number of kills in regions across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanna said, &quot;In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions. In the mid-&#39;70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Counting lions in the wild is extremely difficult and requires a lot of estimation. Any hard numbers, therefore, should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanna&rsquo;s claim&nbsp;reflects the consensus among researchers that lion numbers are in decline. The exact figures are up for some deabte, but his point is certainly valid.&nbsp;We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-03T10:41:24.656949", "ruling_date": "2015-08-03T13:21:08", "ruling_headline": "Jack Hanna talks Cecil on \"This Week,\" claims Africa's lion population is in major decline", "ruling_headline_slug": "jack-hanna-talks-cecil-week-claims-africas-lion-po", "ruling_link_text": "Counting lions an inexact science", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jason Scott Riggio, et al., &quot;<a href=\"http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0381-4/fulltext.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The size of savannah Africa: a lion&rsquo;s (</u><u>Panthera leo</u><u>) view</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 2, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15951/0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Panthera leo</u></a>,&quot; Version 2015.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Geographic Big Cats Initiative, &quot;<a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/lion-decline-map/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Declining Lions</u></a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.
