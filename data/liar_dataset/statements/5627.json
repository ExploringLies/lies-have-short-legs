Rick Perry pointed out that similar identification is already required for some activities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview with Fox News on March 16, 2012, Perry told anchor Bill Hemmer: &quot;It goes without saying that in today&rsquo;s world, having a photo ID -- whether it&rsquo;s to get on an airplane, or whether it&rsquo;s to cash a check or whether it&rsquo;s to check a library book out -- is pretty standard fare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHemmer interjected: &quot;Well, you need a photo ID in New York to buy Sudafed.&quot; Chuckling, Perry replied: &quot;And I might add, in Texas too.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe issue was raised a few days after the U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/ltr/l_031212.php\">concluded </a>that a Texas mandate that voters present photo IDs could prevent thousands of Hispanic Texas voters from casting ballots &mdash; thus violating federal voting-rights laws. According to a March 12, 2012, Associated Press <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/justice-dept-opposes-texas-voter-id-law-15901863#.T3C0psUgcg4\">news article</a>, the government&rsquo;s objection means the Texas law, which Perry signed in 2011, cannot be enforced unless a federal court in Washington clears the way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn aside: Perry may have overstated the hurdle for library books. In December 2010, we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/dec/11/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-you-cant-check-out-library-boo/\">rated Mostly False</a> a similar claim by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst.after finding that libraries did not require photo IDs at checkout, though patrons of most libraries had to show a photo ID when applying for a library card.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe burrowed in to see if it&rsquo;s correct that Texas purchasers of Sudafed must present a photo ID.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSudafed, a decongestant, contains pseudoephedrine, which is a precursor drug to manufacturing illegal methamphetamines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2005 Texas law required pharmacies to make a person purchasing pills containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or nopseudoephedrine to display a driver&#39;s license or other ID containing the purchaser&#39;s photograph, as<a href=\"http://www.tsbp.state.tx.us/pseudoephedrine.htm\"> noted online</a> by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA legislative summary of the <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=79R&amp;Bill=HB164\">proposal</a>, offering the measure&rsquo;s rationale, <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/79R/analysis/html/HB00164S.htm\">said</a> that in 2000, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse reported that 1,821 people were admitted into Texas treatment centers for methamphetamine abuse; as of 2004, that number had risen to 11,238.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, case closed?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPretty much, Gay Dodson, executive director of the state pharmacy board, told us, and she pointed out by email that a <a href=\"http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/meth/index.html\">federal act</a>, also approved in 2005, includes a photo ID requirement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to information on a Department of Justice <a href=\"http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/meth/q_a_cmea.htm#12\">web page</a>, the federal law requires customers purchasing products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine to show a photo ID issued by a state or federal government. If the purchaser lacks such an ID, <a href=\"http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/meth/alternate_ID2.pdf\">other types may be used</a>, such as a U.S. passport, certain unexpired foreign passports, a school ID card with a photograph or voter registration card, among alternatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.486.htm\">Texas law</a> requires a business making an over-the-counter sale of a product containing ephedrine, &nbsp;pseudoephedrine or norpseudoephedrine to make the purchaser show a driver&rsquo;s license or other form of photo ID that indicates the person is 16 or older. Dodson noted, too, that legislators in 2011 amended the law to specify that the presented IDs must be government-issued.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUpshot: Perry&rsquo;s Sudafed statement reflects both state and federal ID requirements. It&rsquo;s True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-26T14:36:02.867065", "ruling_date": "2012-03-28T18:28:40", "ruling_headline": "Rick Perry says photo ID required to purchase Sudafed in Texas", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-perry-says-photo-id-required-purchase-sudafed", "ruling_link_text": "All over the Achoo S A", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTexas State Board of Pharmacy, web page &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tsbp.state.tx.us/pseudoephedrine.htm\">NEW STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SELLING PSEUDOEPHEDRINE PRODUCTS!!!&quot;</a> (accessed March 21, 2012)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWeb page, <a href=\"http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/meth/q_a_cmea.htm#12\">&quot;Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 Questions &amp; Answers&quot;</a>, U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control (accessed March 21, 2012)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1W7dQBh-XI-KDk-gVJx7kT8I3BnoR3SyiERUCFEze3Bk\">response</a> to PolitiFact Texas, Gay Dodson, executive director, Texas State Board of Pharmacy, March 21, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 30, "current_job": "U.S. Energy Secretary", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 42, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 291, "last_name": "Perry", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "rick-perry", "pants_count": 18, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Perry_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/291/", "total_count": 176, "true_count": 26, "website": "https://energy.gov/management/history/secretaries-energy"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays you need a photo ID to purchase Sudafed in Texas.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Fox News interview.", "statement_date": "2012-03-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
