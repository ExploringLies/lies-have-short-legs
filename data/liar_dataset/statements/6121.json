Chris Christie makes it sound, Democrats in the state Assembly are a bunch of crazed junkies looking for their next fix of raising taxes and he&rsquo;s the one forcing them into withdrawal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a June 13 town hall meeting in Atlantic County, the Republican governor pointed to his opposition to a proposed gas tax increase as an example of him fighting off the Democrats&rsquo; addiction.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Now I&rsquo;ve been governor now for over 800 days and we vetoed two income tax increases. They wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that,&quot; said Christie, according to a video posted June 14 on YouTube. &quot;Imagine now if you&rsquo;re paying 20 to 25 cents more a gallon. That&rsquo;s what the Assembly Democrats would have gotten for you. We&rsquo;re saying no to all that stuff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So now&hellip;you got to see what&rsquo;s happening with the Assembly Democrats. They&rsquo;re like people going through withdrawals. They haven&rsquo;t gotten to raise a tax in over 800 days. They&rsquo;re down on the ground. They&rsquo;re sweating. They&rsquo;re twitching. It&rsquo;s ugly, &lsquo;cause I keep saying no.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuch colorful language, and yet so misleading, PolitiFact New Jersey found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere has been a proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but despite Christie&rsquo;s suggestion, it hasn&rsquo;t been pushed by the Assembly Democratic leadership and stopped by the governor. In fact, the legislation has never made it to the governor&rsquo;s desk for him to take any action.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Assemblyman Albert Coutinho (D-Essex) has introduced the bill twice over the last roughly two years, but has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. The full Assembly has never voted on the proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Coutinho put it, &quot;this bill is going nowhere.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst introduced in May 2010, Coutinho&rsquo;s bill called for annual increases of 8-cents-per-gallon in fiscal years 2011 through 2013. According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, those increases were projected to generate a total of about $2.4 billion over the three-year period to go toward the state&rsquo;s Transportation Trust Fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCoutinho said the tax hike would allow the state to stop borrowing for the fund, which supports various transportation projects.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the bill, which Coutinho reintroduced in January for the current legislative session, hasn&rsquo;t moved an inch since being referred to an Assembly committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Leadership&rsquo;s not looking to do this,&quot; Coutinho told us. &quot;Nobody seems willing to politically have that conversation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, explained that Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver does not support raising the gas tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Hundreds if not thousands of bills are proposed each session without getting a hearing. Nothing unusual about it at all,&quot; Hester said in an e-mail. &quot;The governor is once again misleading the public.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie spokesman Michael Drewniak noted how other Democrats have indicated support for a gas tax increase, including state Sen. Raymond Lesniak and state Assemblyman and state Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Christie&rsquo;s role in stopping such a tax hike, Drewniak added: &quot;The Governor was emphatic many times amid this discussion by Democrats that he would not sign legislation increasing the gasoline tax and add a new tax burden on over-taxed New Jersey residents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The unambiguous promise of a veto is often just as effective in stopping legislation in its tracks as is the actual act of a veto.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Assembly Democrats &quot;wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that.&quot; Now Democrats are &quot;down on the ground. They&rsquo;re sweating. They&rsquo;re twitching. It&rsquo;s ugly, &lsquo;cause I keep saying no,&quot; Christie added.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s right about there being a Democratic proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but Assembly Democratic leaders have stopped the bill from moving forward. Since its first introduction in May 2010, the bill has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Christie&rsquo;s claim &quot;ignores critical facts that would give a different impression,&quot; we rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/politifact_nj_christie_claims_6.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-20T13:32:33.555545", "ruling_date": "2012-06-21T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims he stopped Assembly Democrats from raising the gas tax by $2.4 billion", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-he-stopped-assembly-democrat", "ruling_link_text": "Democrats never pushed bill", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzh84Lfugpc&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.9108655973090389\">Chris Christie - We Have to Cut Taxes</a>, a video posted on YouTube on June 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssembly Bill A-1633, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A2000/1633_I1.HTM\">Increases motor fuels tax eight cents per year for three years with later CPI adjustment and requires all motor fuels taxes to be credited to Transportation Trust Fund</a>, introduced Jan. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssembly Bill A-2718, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2010/Bills/A3000/2718_I1.HTM\">Increases motor fuels tax eight cents per year for three years with later CPI adjustment and requires all motor fuels taxes to be credited to Transportation Trust Fund</a>, introduced May 13, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssembly Bill A-2718, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2010/Bills/A3000/2718_E2.HTM\">Fiscal Estimate</a>, June 1, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNorthJersey.com, <a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/news/Christie_to_taxpayers_Assembly_Democrats_are_lying_to_you.html\">Christie to taxpayers: Assembly Democrats are &#39;lying to you&#39;</a>, April 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsbury Park Press, Gov blasts Democrats at town hall, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with state Assemblyman Albert Coutinho, June 19-20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Tom Hester Jr., spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, June 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/motorfuels_over.shtml\">Motor Fuels Tax: Overview</a>, accessed June 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Michael Drewniak, spokesman for Gov.
