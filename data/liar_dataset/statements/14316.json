Greg Abbott for <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/gov-abbott-calls-for-sweeping-special-session-conservative-goals/BvNzVVKhFENQ9JNj4nUmDK/\">trying to rein in regulations imposed by cities</a>, including Austin, says municipal development fees for building an apartment complex in the capital run nearly 10 times ahead of what&rsquo;s charged in Dallas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Readers asked us to check that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Rep. Paul Workman said in his June 2017 <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/opinion/commentary-abbott-agenda-isn-austin-bashing-liberty-protecting/YjYbLEEULtzHSwDg4v9fLJ/\">commentary</a> in the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>: &quot;I have received a document from an apartment builder that demonstrates the difference in total development fees for building a project in Dallas versus building the same project in Austin. Total fees in Dallas: $120,081. Total fees in Austin: $1,026,852 &ndash; nearly 10-times higher for the same project! There is no way to argue that these fees are not contributing to the affordability crisis in Austin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We zeroed in on the declared figures after Brian Mitchell in Workman&rsquo;s state office emailed us an <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGVm9jZ0ZlWE1HLXM/view?usp=sharing\">undated document</a> showing fees attributed to the cities of Dallas and Austin, respectively, in each case to authorize construction of a four-story, 243,000-square-foot, 322-unit apartment project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workman didn&rsquo;t say who created or provided the document. But John Burnham, managing director of Argyle Residential, which develops multi-family projects in major cities including Austin and Denver, told us he created the document in June 2016 or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham said by phone the Austin figures on the document relate to a 322-unit project, anticipated at Gonzales and Tillery streets in East Austin, and the Dallas figures were based on adjusting up city fees associated with plans to build a 260-unit project on the east side of Dallas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham said by email: &quot;The purpose of my spreadsheet was to illustrate the difference in permitting costs associated with a 322-unit wrap-style apartment project in Austin vs that same project in Dallas. I was not attempting to display a summary of actual fees paid on a specific project. The fees that I outlined are accurate fees based on adopted ordinances and city codes. We have paid roughly these amounts on several projects in Austin and Dallas recently.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Variation&nbsp;in figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham didn&rsquo;t provide more data. For our part, we asked Austin city officials to review the 23 fees listed in Burnham&rsquo;s document for the described project in that city and we asked Dallas officials to check the nine fees listed for such a Dallas project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the respective officials, the presented dollar-for-dollar comparison missed some fees while overstating and understating a few. Still, it came out that there were far higher total fees likely in Austin than in Dallas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dallas fees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, a Dallas city spokesman, Richard Hill, provided a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5WTc2zU3WVlSUFeNHn8k9D64ky0RV2QEDY89VdwYwg/edit?usp=sharing\">document</a> showing what he described as the best estimate by city officials there of the fees likely associated with a 322-unit complex in that city in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That Dallas document suggests total costs of $124,792.02, some $4,711 or 4 percent greater than the total fee costs estimated by Burnham about a year before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big added cost, according to the city, would come from at least $23,000 for a base permit for the complex&rsquo;s garage, compared with $16,645 in Burnham&rsquo;s document. The Dallas document also specifies $1,500 in fees for up to three engineering reviews of paving/grading/drainage as well as $2,690.66 for a fire sprinkler review for the garage; the document cited by Workman did &nbsp;not specify those fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dallas document also suggests some lower costs than estimated by Burnham such as $8,250 related to the city&rsquo;s express review of the development plan compared with $12,000 estimated by Burnham. Similarly, the Dallas document indicates $2,714 in fees for two four-inch water meters and a wastewater connection compared with $7,380 in the document Workman touted, and $735 for irrigation meter permits compared with $2,650 in the other document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Austin fees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email and phone, a City of Austin spokeswoman, Sylvia Arzola, confirmed most of the city fees listed in the Workman-cited document in connection with the envisioned project, but she said the garage fees would be about $6,000 lower if that facility didn&rsquo;t have plumbing and wasn&rsquo;t heated or air-conditioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arzola noted that a major cost shown for Austin and not Dallas--a parkland dedication fee--increased as of October 2016 so the up-to-date charge on the described project would be $346,230, nearly $43,000 greater than the fee shown on what Workman cited. Arzola noted too that <a href=\"https://www.austintexas.gov/department/parkland-dedication\">developers may donate land</a> in lieu of paying the fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arzola wrote that the Workman-cited document appears to have missed a fee--the city&rsquo;s Commercial Building Plan Review fee calculated based on a builder&rsquo;s valuation of labor and materials. Working from the city&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Development_Services/Commercial_Fees.pdf\">web post</a> of commercial review and permit fees, it looked to us like the fee on the project would start at $655.20 plus $1.30 for every $1,000 in labor-materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arzola further confirmed Austin doesn&rsquo;t offer an expedited review like the one described for Dallas, but she said one is in the works; its target rollout date is October 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Water-wastewater fees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spotted another wide contrast.&nbsp;Both cities, the Workman-cited document says, charge a fee for domestic water and wastewater meters, but Austin&rsquo;s fee, $380,000, greatly outpaces the Dallas fee, $7,380. A note on the document says the Austin figure assumes the development site requires a replat. If that&rsquo;s not so, the note says, the Austin water/wastewater fee drops to $55,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Joseph Gonzales, a finance administrator for the Austin Water Utility, said the document&#39;s Austin figures for water and wastewater meter and irrigation meter fees appeared accurate. Asked to speak to Austin charging considerably more than Dallas for such fees, Gonzales said: &quot;We&rsquo;re trying to balance the impact of development between the development community and our ratepayers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dallas-Austin contrasts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we inquired generally into&nbsp;why the&nbsp;cities&nbsp;have dramatically distinct fee schedules in connection with building&nbsp;apartment complexes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-wren-070755b4/\">Carl Wren</a>, assistant director of Austin&rsquo;s Development Services Department, told us some Austin fees reflect the greater complexity of the city&rsquo;s municipal code. He said Dallas, for instance, doesn&rsquo;t have the Save Our Springs limits put in place in the 1990s to protect waters flowing into Barton Springs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Austin developers told us the city&rsquo;s development fees amount to one of various factors affecting affordable housing. <a href=\"http://momarkdevelopment.com/team/terry-mitchell/\">Terry Mitchell</a>, a veteran local developer, said by email: &quot;On one affordable project of which I am aware, $3,000 per unit is being spent on tree replacement (even after preserving all heritage trees).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-stauch-73a4a31b/\">David Stauch</a>, president of Capital Project Management, an Austin construction company, said he&#39;s helped build projects in both cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stauch said Austin&rsquo;s plan review fees run considerably higher &quot;likely owing to the greater number of departmental reviews required, and the greater level of scrutiny by each,&quot; perhaps a tradeoff for &quot;quality of the built environment, but folks in Dallas like it just fine,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stauch further said the &quot;increased fees might also be due to Austin&rsquo;s low density. The more spread out a city is, the more infrastructure needed to serve the residents.&quot; A 2015 U.S. Census Bureau <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p25-1142.pdf\">report</a> based on 2013 population estimates pegs the density of Dallas at 3,684 residents per square mile,&nbsp;29 percent greater than Austin&rsquo;s density of 2,855 residents per square mile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://indytexans.org/wp-content/uploads/Brian-Rodgers-Bio.pdf\">Brian Rodgers</a>, an Austin civic activist and real estate investor, said it makes good sense for developers to pay for&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/business/market-forces-keep-squeezing-austin-area-apartment-renters/kVD2vai4K4WOYL2gXGo6xK/\">impact of their development on public infrastructure</a>. Rodgers further noted by email that it&rsquo;s been <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/LG/htm/LG.395.htm\">state law since 1989</a> that cities may recoup water, wastewater, roads and drainage costs related to extending city services. &quot;Austin doesn&rsquo;t charge&quot; developer fees &quot;for roads or drainage,&quot; Rodgers added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our &nbsp;ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workman said it&rsquo;s documented that City of Austin fees for building an apartment complex are nearly 10 times Dallas&rsquo;s fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found accurate multiple&nbsp;itemized entries in the 2016 document cited by Workman though there also were missing fees and some figures that weren&#39;t right. On balance, it looks&nbsp;like city fees for building the project in Austin could exceed Big D&rsquo;s&nbsp;fees by eight times or more, still making for a considerable difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the&nbsp;claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
