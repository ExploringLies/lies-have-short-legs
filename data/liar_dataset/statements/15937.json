Doctors were handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place &quot;Candy Land.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attacks on Baldwin began in early 2017 from <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/americas-pac/\">a super PAC</a> <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cmte=C00559906&amp;cycle=2018\">largely funded</a> by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. The group claimed in a radio ad that Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about &quot;overmedicated veterans,&quot; she made &quot;deadly mistakes&quot; and &quot;three veterans died.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/05/americas-pac/super-pac-attack-blaming-tammy-baldwin-deaths-3-ve/\">We rated that False</a>, based on how and when the deaths occurred and the &quot;deadly mistakes&quot; part of the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to Vukmir&rsquo;s claim, which doesn&rsquo;t go so far as to blame Baldwin for a death.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">1. Baldwin &lsquo;only one&rsquo; to have a report</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part of Vukmir&rsquo;s claim is that, among the Wisconsin members of the U.S. House and Senate, only Baldwin received a report &quot;outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids&quot; at the Tomah VA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4936793-VA-report.html\">The report</a> was done by the Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo; Office of Inspector General following a 2&frac12;-year investigation of Tomah. <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/26/wisconsin-senate-race-6-things-you-need-know-tomah-va/1358782002/\">Baldwin&rsquo;s office</a> received it on Aug. 29, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2015/01/19/sen-baldwin-had-tomah-va-report-for-months/22025759/\">Baldwin did not</a> make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. <a href=\"https://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/21/baldwin-fire-inaction-tomah-report-offers-answers/22133469/\">The report was not given</a> to any other member of Congress at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Baldwin had been informed about the problems at the Tomah VA before they were exposed publicly. And she doesn&rsquo;t dispute that she was the first member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation to get the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/politifact.wisconsin/\">Like us on Facebook</a>.

He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simcakoski death, however, occurred Aug. 30, 2014 &nbsp;&mdash; just one day after Baldwin received the VA inspector general&rsquo;s report about Tomah that Vukmir highlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s misleading to say &quot;later a veteran died,&quot; given that Baldwin had not had time to act on the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">3. Baldwin &lsquo;covered it up&rsquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The third part of Vukmir&rsquo;s claim is that Baldwin &quot;covered it up&quot; &nbsp;&mdash; a reference to the entire Tomah VA matter, not solely to Simcakoski&rsquo;s death. In the interview, Vukmir elaborates by saying Baldwin tried to &quot;fire one of her aides that brought the issue forward, offering the aide &quot;taxpayer hush money&quot; and hiring &quot;Hillary Clinton&#39;s attorneys&quot; to &quot;cover this up.&quot; Let&rsquo;s break down these sub-points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important point: It&rsquo;s clear Baldwin did not take steps publicly on the scandal until the Center for Investigative Reporting&rsquo;s expose &nbsp;&mdash; months after she received the inspector general&rsquo;s report and Simcakoski&rsquo;s death. At the same time, there is no evidence that she took active steps to cover up the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Firing:</strong> Baldwin did fire an aide, but it&rsquo;s not entirely clear she did so because the aide &quot;brought the issue forward.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2015, after the Center for Investigative Reporting&rsquo;s expose, Baldwin had called for the VA to investigate Tomah but remained under fire for inaction on the scandal. <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/sen-tammy-baldwin-ousts-aide-over-va-controversy-b99431970z1-289737031.html/\">Baldwin then fired</a> Marquette Baylor, her deputy state director, without explanation, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed. Whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee Ryan Honl told the newspaper he had talked with Baylor for two hours in late November 2014 about the Tomah VA and that she discouraged him from going public with his concerns, saying that doing so might get her and others fired. <a href=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/8c3c45231ef03741c0f9afba5/files/3f02c852-94b0-4b54-a1a8-93c719020efa/WI_Marquette_Baylor_Ethics_Complaint_against_Senator_Tammy_Baldwin.pdf\">Baylor later said</a> she had prepared three memos on the Tomah situation for Baldwin&#39;s review and forwarded them to her supervisors; she alleged they were either not delivered to Baldwin or were ignored by Baldwin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Hush money&rsquo;, Clinton lawyer:</strong> Baldwin did offer a severance payment to the fired aide and did hire a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer. But this needs further explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the firing, Baldwin&#39;s office offered a severance package to Baylor that would have included a confidentiality agreement and a payment, the Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/sen-tammy-baldwin-ousts-aide-over-va-controversy-b99431970z1-289737031.html/\">reported</a>.

The complaint asked the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee to investigate Baldwin.
