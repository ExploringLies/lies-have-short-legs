House of Representatives, said it&rsquo;s an overwhelming consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The one thing where we&rsquo;ve seen nearly unanimous &ndash; well, nothing&rsquo;s unanimous &ndash; but 80 percent support out there is the concept that men should not be in women&rsquo;s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, et cetera &ndash; that that shouldn&rsquo;t happen,&quot; Moore said in a May 5 discussion with reporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked into polling on bathroom policy and found a wide range of results. Most don&rsquo;t reach 80 percent, but clearly substantial numbers of people in North Carolina have told pollsters they oppose letting transgender people choose what bathroom to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polls have found safety concerns are also on some people&rsquo;s minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one can say that there will never be any privacy or safety issues &ndash; of course there could be. But in a previous fact check, we looked for instances of sexual predators using the cover of transgender-friendly bathroom laws to dress up as the other sex and prey on people in bathrooms, the scenario many have said they&rsquo;re concerned about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/01/chris-sgro/equality-nc-director-no-public-safety-risks-cities/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>We found it Mostly True</u></a> that such a scenario has never happened. We didn&rsquo;t give it a True because there have been a few unproven allegations in the U.S. and one conviction in Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Obama administration also hasn&rsquo;t put stock in those concerns, and has said banning transgender people from the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is a civil rights violation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in that context, along with the administration&rsquo;s threat to withhold federal funding from North Carolina, that Moore made his &quot;nearly unanimous,&quot; &quot;80 percent&quot; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Uncertainty abounds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find one poll from the conservative Raleigh-based Civitas Institute that was close to backing up Moore&rsquo;s claim. We&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s the poll he was citing or if he was citing a poll at all &ndash; Moore didn&rsquo;t respond to our questions &ndash; but we&rsquo;ll proceed anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poll asked: &quot;Do you agree or disagree with a Virginia federal court ruling ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker room, bathroom and shower facilities?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poll did find that 80 percent of people said they disagreed with the court ruling. However, we have several issues with the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question is not only leading and inflammatory but also fundamentally misconstrues what the court ruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No boys and girls were ordered to shower, change or use the bathroom together. Instead, a federal appeals court ruled that a judge in Virginia had to reconsider a transgender boy&rsquo;s request to use the boys&rsquo; facilities at school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court also said the Obama administration acted legally in defining sex-based discrimination to include discrimination against transgender people. That&rsquo;s the part that may have given rise to the poll question&rsquo;s wording, since the student is likely to win now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly said that although schools should recognize transgender students&rsquo; rights, schools should also recognize other students&rsquo; right to privacy and that no student should be forced to openly share a changing area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In school districts around the country that have already recognized transgender students&rsquo; gender identities, officials have typically put <a href=\"http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160115/news/160119309/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>private stalls in locker rooms</u></a> and/or offered <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-transgender-locker-20160211-story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>unisex one-person bathrooms</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the issues with that question, let&rsquo;s look at another. Another earlier poll from Civitas asked people a more accurate and nuanced question about transgender people in bathrooms, describing the arguments on both sides. This poll came before the state overturned Charlotte&rsquo;s LGBT ordinance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Charlotte City Council passed a new bathroom ordinance for transgender people that allows biological men and biological women, who identify as the opposite sex, to use the bathroom or locker room of their choosing,&quot; the question stated, asking people to pick sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly 70 percent said they opposed the idea. Not 80 percent, but close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about polls from groups with less political bias?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a joint poll from SurveyUSA in partnership with Time Warner Cable News, 51 percent of North Carolinians think transgender people should not be able to choose which bathroom to use. That&rsquo;s not &quot;nearly unanimous&quot; like Moore said; it&rsquo;s barely a majority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another joint poll from SurveyUSA and a different TV station, WRAL, found 56 percent in agreement that transgender people shouldn&rsquo;t be able to choose which bathroom to use &ndash; again, a majority, but not close to 80 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A prominent conservative group, Civitas, did find 70 and 80 percent in two polls, although we had some serious doubts about the question that found the 80 percent support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two polls from&nbsp;the less partisan SurveyUSA in partnership with local TV stations have found 56 percent and 51 percent of North Carolinians support the idea. That&rsquo;s still a majority, but it&rsquo;s certainly not the &quot;nearly unanimous,&quot; &quot;80 percent support&quot; that Moore claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/49f0e634-7574-479d-ae14-5c89d8dee47e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/49f0e634-7574-479d-ae14-5c89d8dee47e</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-14T18:31:23.157993", "ruling_date": "2016-05-14T18:30:21", "ruling_headline": "NC House speaker says 80 percent think bathrooms should be separated by biological gender", "ruling_headline_slug": "nc-house-speaker-says-80-percent-think-bathrooms-s", "ruling_link_text": "Some polls say 50 percent", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Chicago Daily Herald, Jan. 15, 2016 <a href=\"http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160115/news/160119309/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Transgender student gains locker room access at Fremd High School&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Los Angeles Times, Feb. 11, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-transgender-locker-20160211-story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Transgender student&#39;s use of locker room causes stir at San Diego high school&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The News &amp; Observer, May 13, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article77383862.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;US gives directive to schools on transgender bathroom access&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NC Civitas Poll, <a href=\"https://1ttd918ylvt17775r1u6ng1adc-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CivitasNCPollApril2016.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>April 2016 results</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NC Civitas Poll, <a href=\"https://www.nccivitas.org/2016/17523/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>March 2016 results</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, April 19, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/us/appeals-court-favors-transgender-student-in-virginia-restroom-case.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Appeals Court Favors Transgender Student in Virginia Restroom Case&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time Warner Cable News Central NC and SurveyUSA poll, May 13, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.twcnews.com/nc/triangle-sandhills/politics/2016/04/4/exclusive-poll--majority-of-voters-approve-of-hb2--but-worry-it-hurts-state-business---image.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Exclusive Poll: Majority of Voters Approve of Overturning Charlotte Anti-Discrimination Ordinance&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WRAL-TV and SurveyUSA poll, April 12, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.wral.com/asset/news/state/nccapitol/2016/04/12/15637752/PollPrint.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;NC Voters Continue to Wrestle With HB2 Fallout: Majority in State Now Opposes New &#39;Bathroom&#39; Law in General, But Supports Specific Birth-Gender Provision&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights memo, Dec. 1, 2014, <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/faqs-title-ix-single-sex-201412.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Questions and Answers on Title IX and Single-Sex Elementary and Secondary Classes and Extracurricular Activities&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of the Attorney General memo, Dec. 15, 2014, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2014/12/18/title_vii_memo.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Treatment of Transgender Employment Discrimination Claims Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Speaker of the N.C.
