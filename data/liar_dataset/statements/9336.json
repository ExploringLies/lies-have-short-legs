Malin directed us to this statement: &quot;Slightly more than half of the U.S. population experiences poverty at some time before the age of 65.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s very different from what Malin said. Poverty and hunger often correlate. But experts - including the report&rsquo;s author - underscore that they are not one and the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture and many nonprofit or non-governmental organizations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>use the term &quot;food insecurity,&quot; that is, &quot;people who lack consistent access to adequate food and are unable at times during the year to acquire adequate food because they lack sufficient money or resources.&quot; Plainly stated: they have difficulty putting food on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USDA defines hunger as a physiological condition &quot;that might result from food insecurity.&quot; A government panel has recommended a national assessment of hunger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caroline Ratcliffe, co-author of the Urban Institute Report that Malin cites, said, &quot;The 50 percent number that he quotes echoes findings in the poverty literature that half of the population will be poor before 65.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The percentage of Americans who experience poverty and economic hardship is very high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we also know, but isn&rsquo;t exactly the number he cites, is that people who are poor - a lot of them are food insecure,&quot; Ratcliffe said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers &quot;move together, but they are not the same thing,&quot; Ratcliffe said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also interviewed Alisha J. Coleman-Jensen, PhD, a sociologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Economic Research Service and author of numerous articles and reports on household food insecurity. That includes &quot;Household Food Security in the United States in 2012.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, &quot;by our estimate, 14.5 percent of households were food insecure,&quot; she said. That translates to roughly 49 million people in 17.6 million households. Of those, &quot;5.7 percent of households are at a high risk for food insecurity, meaning they are not getting enough to eat, have disrupted eating patterns or go whole days without food.Those numbers are &quot;not anywhere near 50 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Malin&rsquo;s claim, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know where that&rsquo;s from ... I haven&rsquo;t seen that figure anywhere.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coleman-Jensen wondered aloud if Malin had misinterpreted the close to 50 million people living in food-insecure households as 50 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If they&rsquo;re talking about somebody going hungry at any point in their lives &hellip; we do not have data that would allow us to measure the percent of people who will experience food insecurity or low food security &lsquo;at some point in their lives.&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; She noted that &quot;our data [are] for a single year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University, in St. Louis, has conducted research that found that half of all American children will at some point be in a household that uses food stamps. But he said he knew of no studies that addressed lifetime risk of hunger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One could argue that if you&rsquo;re using food stamps you&rsquo;re at risk of experiencing hunger, but that would be as far as one could go,&quot; Rank said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kathleen Gorman, director of the University of Rhode Island&rsquo;s Feinstein Center for a Hunger-Free America, says she does not find Malin&rsquo;s statement unreasonable, &quot;but it is extremely difficult to prove.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First of all, we do not have any good measures of &lsquo;hunger&rsquo; -- it is a pretty amorphous idea. &nbsp;When we measure hunger, we typically use the USDA Household Food Security survey -- and while they are not identical, most people accept that one is an indicator of the other,&quot; she said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anti-poverty activist Robert Malin said half of all Americans will go hungry at some point in their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we talked with knew of no research that supported Malin&rsquo;s claim. And studies show the percentage of Americans facing &quot;food insecurity&quot; annually is closer to 15 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some studies, however, have found that half of all Americans will be poor at some point in their lives. And researchers say hunger and poverty are linked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(<em>Correction: Robert Malin is an activist with the Rhode Island Mobilization Against Poverty.
