This, they argue, is one reason metro Atlanta needs to support a 1-cent sales tax to fund an overhaul of the region&rsquo;s transportation system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When housing and transportation costs are combined, Atlanta&rsquo;s cost of living -- typically perceived as relatively low -- ranks as 7th worst out of 51 metros nationally,&quot; the ad said. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeventh-worst? And here we were, feeling smug about paying less for a mortgage on a three-bedroom house than our Yankee cousins shell out to rent a studio apartment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs this true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf voters approve this tax hike July 31, it would raise an estimated $7.2 billion to build transportation projects across the region. About $1 billion would go to projects with a more local focus. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBackers argue the transportation special local option sales tax, also known as T-SPLOST, would reduce congestion and bring jobs to town. Opponents think it would cost too much and pay for the wrong projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe fished around for data on Atlanta&rsquo;s cost of living and found a new but widely used measure called the &quot;H+T Affordability Index.&quot; Certain urban planners consider it to be a better measure of a town&rsquo;s cost of living because it takes transportation into account. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s published by the Center for Neighborhood Technology, a Chicago-based nonprofit that researches and promotes &quot;sustainable&quot; communities, or ones designed to provide a better quality of life, help the environment and be affordable. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIts index is based, in part, on mathematical models. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Census Bureau tracks yearly costs for housing but not transportation. So the index uses mathematical models created with the help of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution to estimate transportation costs. The methodology was peer-reviewed and published by an academic journal in 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe index has been well received. Last year, the planning agency for the Washington area used the H+T approach to study that region&rsquo;s affordability, while the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it is building on the model to create its own affordability index.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn February, the Center for Neighborhood Technology released a ranking of annual transportation costs for the nation&rsquo;s 51 metro areas with populations of 1 million and up. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt found that if a typical American family moved to the New York City metro area, they&rsquo;d spend nearly $10,160 per year on transportation. That&rsquo;s the cheapest on the list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most expensive is Birmingham. If a typical family moved there, their costs would rise to $14,930.<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta is eighth-highest, or one notch less expensive than Citizens for Transportation Mobility said in its ad. Yearly costs topped $14,300,<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut this particular H+T ranking addresses transportation costs only -- not housing and transportation costs combined. The group, however, does have that information.<br />\r\n\tSo we built our own list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIncomes, the price of housing, the number of cars a household owns and other factors vary by metro area. This means that comparing dollar values for these expenses may shed little light on the true impact of these costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA better approach is to look at what percent of income a typical metro household spends on housing and transportation. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe H+T index calculates these percentages, so we ranked them for the nation&rsquo;s 51 largest metro areas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur analysis found that metro Atlanta ranks as the 16th-most-expensive area in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe typical metro Atlanta household spends more than 52 percent of its income on housing and transportation combined. This is higher than the national average, which is slightly more than 51 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Washington metro area was the cheapest at 43 percent. Households in the Miami area spend the most at 60 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome areas of metro Atlanta are vastly more affordable than others, according to the index. In parts of the Roswell area, households spend nearly 80 percent of their incomes on housing and transportation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn parts of downtown Atlanta, that number plummets to 21 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, Citizens for Transportation Mobility missed the mark. Its ad said that metro Atlanta is the seventh-most-expensive major metro area when you consider housing and transportation costs combined.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s not. Metro Atlanta is the 16th-most-expensive, according to H+T index data. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSixteen out of 51 isn&rsquo;t great. And it reinforces the group&rsquo;s overall point that transportation costs significantly add to the cost of living in metro Atlanta.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s not as bad as Citizens for Transportation Mobility said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt earns a Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-03T16:50:56.239721", "ruling_date": "2012-05-04T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Atlanta cost-of-living worse than advertised, group says", "ruling_headline_slug": "atlanta-cost-living-worse-advertised-group-says", "ruling_link_text": "It's not great, but not as bad as you think.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGeorgia Trend, <a href=\"http://www.georgiatrend.com/Untie_Atlanta.pdf\">&quot;Untie Atlanta&quot; advertising supplement</a>, received April 16, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCenter for Neighborhood Technology, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.htaindex.org/map/\">H+T Affordability Index</a>,&quot; accessed April 24, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tH+T Affordability Index, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnt.org/repository/2012-Fact-Sheet-Rankings.pdf\">Average Annual Transportation Costs for the National Typical Household</a>,&quot; Feb. 28, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, &quot;<a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2011/HUDNo.11-180\">HUD Launches Development of a National Housing and Transportation Affordability Index</a>,&quot; Aug. 30, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTransportation Research Board of the National Academies, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, &quot;<a href=\"http://trb.metapress.com/content/g73825l372u56587/?referencesMode=Show\">Estimating Transportation Costs</a><br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://trb.metapress.com/content/g73825l372u56587/?referencesMode=Show\">by Characteristics of Neighborhood and Household</a>,&quot; 2008.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Saba Long, spokeswoman, Citizens for Transportation Mobility, April 24, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Linda Young, research director, Center for Neighborhood Technology, April 24, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Stephanie Morse, research coordinator, Center for Neighborhood Technology, April 24, 2012.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 1831, "last_name": "Citizens for Transportation Mobility", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "citizens-transportation-mobility", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact_mugs_PolitiFact_silhouettes_18.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1831/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;When housing and transportation costs are combined, Atlanta&rsquo;s cost of living -- typically perceived as relatively low -- ranks as 7th worst out of 51 metros nationally.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an ad", "statement_date": "2012-04-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
