Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn&rsquo;t happy about President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/business/trump-tariffs-washing-machines-solar-panels.html\">authorizing tariffs</a> on solar energy cells and panels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No state generates as much solar power as California, or has as many people whose jobs depend on it. This is an attack on California,&quot; Harris <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/956252336497840129\">tweeted</a> Jan. 24, two days after Trump signed the order.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Harris was correct about how California ranks in U.S. solar power generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a word about the tariffs. They will start at 30 percent and then fall over a four-year period to 15 percent, with some exceptions. The biggest expected loser will be China, which has become the world&rsquo;s largest supplier of solar equipment. The U.S. solar industry has been divided on the tariffs. Two companies &mdash; Suniva Inc. and SolarWorld Americas &mdash; pushed for them, though many end users of solar equipment and solar energy expressed concern about the impact on consumer prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most complete state-by-state data on solar power comes from the Solar Energy Industries Association, the industry&rsquo;s trade group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2018-01/Federal_2017Q3_California_0.pdf\">data</a> shows that California ranked first among states nationally in installed solar capacity in 2016 with 18,296 megawatts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California ranks far ahead on this score. The <a href=\"https://www.seia.org/research-resources/top-10-solar-states\">next-closest</a> state is North Carolina, with less than one-sixth the amount of installed solar capacity. The other states in the top 10 are, in order, Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey, Utah, Massachusetts, Georgia, Texas and New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As for jobs, California also ranks No. 1, with 100,050 positions tallied by the group. The second-ranking state in solar jobs is Massachusetts with 14,582 &mdash;only about one-sixth as many as California.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That isn&rsquo;t entirely surprising: California is the nation&rsquo;s most populous state and <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/state-area.html\">third-biggest by land area</a> behind Alaska and Texas. It also tends to get a lot of sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a per capita basis, the group&rsquo;s data shows California ranks fourth in solar capacity behind Nevada, Utah and Hawaii. It also <a href=\"https://www.solarstates.org/#states/per-capita/2016\">ranks fourth</a> in solar jobs per capita, behind Massachusetts, Nevada and Vermont.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, there&rsquo;s little question that California has actively encouraged solar energy in recent years due to state policy efforts and consumer preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris said, &quot;No state generates as much solar power as California, or has as many people whose jobs depend on it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The raw numbers back her up, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the state&rsquo;s size is a factor. On a per capita basis, California ranks fourth in both solar capacity and solar-related jobs. We rate her statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-25T12:26:56.382602", "ruling_date": "2018-01-25T17:31:44", "ruling_headline": "Is California No. 1 in solar power and solar jobs?", "ruling_headline_slug": "california-no-1-solar-power-and-solar-jobs", "ruling_link_text": "Correct, though not per capita", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Kamala Harris, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/956252336497840129\">tweet</a>, Jan. 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solar Energy Industries Association, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.seia.org/research-resources/top-10-solar-states\">Top 10 Solar States</a>,&quot; accessed Jan. 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solar Energy Industries Association, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2018-01/Federal_2017Q3_California_0.pdf\">Solar Spotlight: California</a>,&quot; accessed Jan. 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solar Energy Industries Association, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.seia.org/news/us-solar-market-sets-new-record-installing-73-gw-solar-pv-2015\">U.S. Solar Market Sets New Record, Installing 7.3 GW of Solar PV in 2015</a>,&quot; Feb. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solar Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.solarstates.org/#states/solar-jobs/2016\">Solar Jobs Census</a>, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/state-area.html\">State Area Measurements and Internal Point Coordinates</a>,&quot; Jan. 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/business/trump-tariffs-washing-machines-solar-panels.html\">Trump Slaps Steep Tariffs on Foreign Washing Machines and Solar Products</a>,&quot; Jan. 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Alex Hobson, senior communications manager at the Solar Energy Industries Association, Jan. 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tyrone Gayle, Harris&rsquo; press secretary, Jan. 24, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kamala", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "California", "id": 2010, "last_name": "Harris", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "kamala-harris", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kamala_Harris_AP_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2010/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://oag.ca.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;No state generates as much solar power as California, or has as many people whose jobs depend on it.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2018-01-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 115, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/115/", "subject": "Technology", "subject_slug": "technology", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Is California No. 1 in solar power and solar jobs?"}
