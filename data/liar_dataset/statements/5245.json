Steve Cohen says the United States has neglected its roads and bridges, but in November argued that the nation had an opportunity to repair them by passing President Barack Obama&#39;s jobs bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mGtKpl_Uwk&amp;feature=player_embedded#%21\">speech on the House floor</a>, the Memphis Democrat said the U.S. was lagging behind other nations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No longer is America the top nation in the globe on infrastructure; it&rsquo;s the countries in Asia and other places. We&rsquo;re 15th on the list of infrastructure,&quot; Cohen said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat jobs bill may be going nowhere, but President Obama, in Tuesday&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/24/remarks-president-state-union-address\">State of the Union speech</a>, called for &quot;a broader agenda to repair America&rsquo;s infrastructure.&quot; He said that &quot;so much of America needs to be rebuilt&quot; and that it was time &quot;to do some nation-building right here at home.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered: Is the United States really falling behind other countries when it comes to infrastructure?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCohen&#39;s office says the source of his information was the Building America&rsquo;s Future Education Fund, which bills itself as a &quot;bipartisan national infrastructure coalition&quot; and lobbies for more governmental spending on infrastructure -- especially roads and bridges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCohen accurately quotes from the group&rsquo;s report entitled, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bafuture.com/sites/default/files/ReportRelease.pd\">Falling Apart and Falling Behind</a>,&quot; which attributes the ranking to &nbsp;the World Economic Forum, a Switzerland-based international organization funded by more than 1,000 companies that promotes interaction among nations and conducts research with a declared commitment to &nbsp;&quot;improving the state of the world.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tActually, Building America&rsquo;s Future slightly overstates America&rsquo;s infrastructure rating by the World Economic Forum -- <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-2011-2012/\">it&rsquo;s No. 16 among 139</a>countries in the 2011-12 rankings, not No. 15. &nbsp;The United States was 15th last year, having slipped from &nbsp;first back in 2005.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Forum infrastructure ranking is based on nine measures ranging from the number of airline seats available (we&rsquo;re No. 1!) &nbsp;to the number of mobile phones per 100 residents (we&rsquo;re No. 83). So it&#39;s worth noting that the overall ranking goes well beyond &nbsp;the point of the congressman&rsquo;s speech, namely the need to build or repair roads and bridges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, on road rankings, perhaps the most relevant to Cohen&rsquo;s commentary, the United States is listed 20th, just below Cyprus and just above Bahrain, so it&#39;s even lower than the overall number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInfrastructure is one of 12 &quot;pillars&quot; the World Economic Forum uses in compiling a &quot;Global Competitiveness Index.&quot; (The United States ranked fifth in the overall index, down from fourth in the previous year and first as recently as 2008.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Cohen is off by a notch in the current overall rankings, while for roads and bridges, the U.S. actually ranks slightly lower, providing more evidence for his point. That&#39;s close enough to earn a True.</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-25T17:02:14.163944", "ruling_date": "2012-01-25T16:00:12", "ruling_headline": "Steve Cohen pushes Democratic claim that U.S. has fallen behind on infrastructure", "ruling_headline_slug": "steve-cohen-pushes-democratic-claim-us-has-fallen-", "ruling_link_text": "U.S. sliding, by many measures", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div>\r\n\tBuilding America&rsquo;s Future Education Fund report, <a href=\"http://www.bafuture.com/sites/default/files/ReportRelease.pd\">&quot;Falling Apart and Falling Behind,</a>&quot; Aug. 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWorld Economic Forum, <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-2011-2012/\">Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012,</a>May, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/24/remarks-president-state-union-address\">2012 &quot;State of the Union&quot; speech</a>, Jan. 25, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mGtKpl_Uwk&amp;feature=player_embedded#%21\">Rep.
