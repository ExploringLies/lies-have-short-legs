But the Democratic vice presidential candidate responded that explanation didn&rsquo;t meet the &quot;Nixon standard.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit,&quot; Kaine said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine often invokes Nixon in calling for Donald Trump to release his tax returns. Back in August, we checked a statement Kaine made where he said that Nixon made his tax returns public &quot;when he was running for president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/aug/22/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-wrongly-says-richard-nixon-released-tax-/\">found</a> that statement was Mostly False, because while Nixon made his tax forms public as president, he never did so while running for the country&rsquo;s highest office. Kaine worded his statement differently this time around, so let&rsquo;s take another look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find Nixon&rsquo;s tax returns for 1969 through 1972 at the <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/web/presidentialtaxreturns\">website</a> for the Presidential Tax History Project, which is run by Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based nonprofit that specializes in tax issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That group has <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/web/presidentialtaxreturns\">compiled</a> tax returns online for past presidents and major-party presidential nominees. Nixon&rsquo;s returns were released in December 1973, a year after he was re-elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, the 37th president was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, and questions were being raised about whether something also was amiss with his tax filings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports had surfaced that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal tax for several years, Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts told us in August. To quell lingering concerns, Nixon released tax returns to the public as well as to the Joint Committee on Taxation. &nbsp;Nixon was under an IRS audit at the time, Thorndike told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an April 2016 blog post, Thorndike <a href=\"http://www.taxanalysts.org/tax-analysts-blog/donald-trump-won-t-release-his-tax-returns-while-under-audit-richard-nixon-did/2016/04/04/193536\">wrote</a> that the IRS audit found Nixon owed almost $500,000 in unpaid taxes and interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nixon released his returns even though he was under audit. Ultimately, the audit didn&rsquo;t go well for him-- it was unpleasant, embarrassing, and ultimately very expensive,&quot; Thorndike wrote. &quot;But it was also necessary, given the persistent questions about Nixon&rsquo;s returns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thorndike says Nixon&rsquo;s disclosure started a tradition where presidents and candidates seeking the highest office release their returns to the public. His successor, President Gerald Ford, didn&rsquo;t make his returns public, although he did release a summary of his returns. Every president since Jimmy Carter has made their tax forms public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine said, &quot;Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is accurate. We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/07d727d8-606f-4b56-b78f-9f6d04911142\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/07d727d8-606f-4b56-b78f-9f6d04911142</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-05T00:05:58.838890", "ruling_date": "2016-10-05T00:05:51", "ruling_headline": "Tim Kaine correctly notes Richard Nixon released tax returns despite audit", "ruling_headline_slug": "tim-kaine-correctly-notes-richard-nixon-released-t", "ruling_link_text": "Audit left Nixon with hefty tax bill", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Tim Kaine&rsquo;s comments at the vice presidential debate, Oct. 4, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/aug/22/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-wrongly-says-richard-nixon-released-tax-/\">&quot;Tim Kaine wrongly says Richard Nixon released tax returns during campaign,&quot;</a> Aug. 22, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign, Oct. 4, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Analysts, <a href=\"http://www.taxanalysts.org/tax-analysts-blog/donald-trump-won-t-release-his-tax-returns-while-under-audit-richard-nixon-did/2016/04/04/193536\">&quot;Donald Trump won&rsquo;t release his tax returns while under audit.
