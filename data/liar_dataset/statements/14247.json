It also points to thousands of photos taken by the Chinese Yutu moon rover, which launched in December 2013 and ceased to operate in July 2016, stating these &quot;showed no trace&quot; of the Apollo moon landing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the rover did take many photos, Andrew Jones, a journalist following China&rsquo;s space program, points out that Yutu landed far from the Apollo landing site, so there wouldn&rsquo;t be evidence one way or another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It had traveled tens of meters in total, when it would have needed to travel thousands of kilometers over varying and hazardous terrain to visit all the Apollo landing sites,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Yutu, with designed minimum lifetime of three (Earth) months and a range of up to 10 kilometers, lasted 31 months on the Moon, but was stationary for the vast majority of this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lunar Reconnaissance Spacecraft has captured ample evidence of the Apollo landing, though, which can be seen in this <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/revisited/index.html#.WUrdc-vysdV\">database</a>. This is the same spacecraft that the Chinese space agency used to determine Yutu&rsquo;s landing site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to photographs, the Apollo mission brought back rock samples that have fueled decades of scientific research, and are available upon <a href=\"https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/sampreq/requestdates.cfm\">request</a> from NASA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So far, no one has seen those samples and declared them to be fake,&quot; director of space policy at Planetary Society Casey Dreier said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story also claims the Chinese space program launched a petition demanding the United States declassify NASA information regarding the U.S. moon landing, signed by 200 of its highest-ranking officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the petition is nowhere to be found and alleged signee and &quot;world renowned nuclear engineer&quot; Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin is actually renowned in fake news circles as a Russian conspiracy theorist denying all moon landings. The only information available about him online, though, has been produced by Mukhin&nbsp;himself, leading Wikipedia to cast serious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Mukhin_(activist)\">doubt</a> on his profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story can be traced back to a 2014 post on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake news that assumes &quot;all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-22T09:39:36.207779", "ruling_date": "2017-06-22T10:32:44", "ruling_headline": "It's fake news that the United States didn't land on the moon", "ruling_headline_slug": "its-fake-news-chinese-lunar-rover-found-no-evidenc", "ruling_link_text": "Made-up story, made-up evidence", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>AntiNewsNetwork.in, <a href=\"http://www.antinews.in/chinese-lunar-rover-finds-no-evidence-american-moon-landings/\">&quot;Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings!&quot;</a> May 21, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WorldNewsDailyReport.com, <a href=\"http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/chinese-lunar-rover-finds-no-evidence-of-american-moon-landings/\">&quot;Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings,&quot;</a> Sept. 25, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Casey Dreier, director of space policy at the Planetary Society, June 21, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Andrew Jones, a journalist covering China&rsquo;s space program for gbtimes.com and contributor to Planetary.org, June 21, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/revisited/index.html#.WUrj4uvysdW\">&quot;Apollo landing sites revisited,&quot;</a> Sept. 30, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular Science, <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/after-40-years-new-results-from-moons-surface\">&quot;After 40 years, new results from the moon&rsquo;s surface,&quot;</a> Dec. 22, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planetary.org, <a href=\"http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/data/change3/pcam.html\">&quot;Chang&rsquo;e 3 data: Rover Panoramic Camera (PCAM),&quot;</a> Jan. 28, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nature Communications, <a href=\" https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9880\">&quot;Correlated compositional and mineralogical investigations at the Chang&rsquo;e 3 landing site,&quot;</a> Dec. 22, 2015.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3972, "last_name": "AntiNews.in", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "antinews", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3972/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://AntiNews.in"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2017-05-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
