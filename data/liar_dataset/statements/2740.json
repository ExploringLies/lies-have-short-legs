Jeb Bush signed a law in 1999 starting vouchers, which he called &quot;Opportunity Scholarships,&quot; that allowed students who attended schools that received an &quot;F&quot; two years in a row based on FCAT scores to transfer to private schools or higher-performing public schools. In 2001, the state started the Tax Credit Scholarship Program to allow corporate donors to give money to nonprofit scholarship-funding organizations, which then give scholarships to poor children. The companies in turn received tax breaks from the state.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"3359\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"3360\" />\r\n\tIn 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down the private school portion of the 1999 program, and the Legislature passed a bill to allow students who received those Opportunity Scholarships in the past to get the tax credit scholarships if they qualified based on having a low income.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"3798\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"3799\" />\r\n\tToday, the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program gives a maximum scholarship of $4,106. For the 2010-11 school year, 524 of these vouchers are used at Jewish schools out of 29,651 -- or about 1.7 percent, according to Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4027\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4028\" />\r\n\tThe students must be eligible for free or reduced-price lunches to qualify.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4105\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4106\" />\r\n\t<strong>Multiple mailers about Gelber</strong><br goog_docs_charindex=\"4136\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4137\" />\r\n\tNow, back to the committee that produced the mailers.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4191\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4192\" />\r\n\tElnatan Rudolph, chair of the Committee for Florida&#39;s Education, is a Jewish political consultant who lives in New Jersey and is a former Teaneck, N.J., council member.

It also sent a mailer about Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink, and did newspapers ads on Gelber,&nbsp;Sink and Democratic CFO candidate Loranne Ausley.

The article was about the state education commissioner at the time, Jim Horne, calling for an investigation into the Silver Archer foundation after about $400,000 in voucher money went missing. The article doesn&#39;t quote Gelber on his views on missing vouchers money, but here is his full quote: &quot;I don&#39;t want to prejudge Silver Archer -- I don&#39;t know what they did -- but this program was an invitation for fraud waste and abuse. This program needs major reformation. It&#39;s an embarrassment.&quot; This article doesn&#39;t support the claim in the ad -- it just shows Gelber was concerned about fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; &quot;Pathetic is zealously pursuing voucher programs that are not merely unconstitutional, but that bleed resources from a school system that can&#39;t afford to lose a dime.&quot; Gelber wrote an editorial for the <em><a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2005-07-04/news/0507010247_1_pathetic-gov-education-budget-seniors\">South Florida&nbsp;</a></em><em><a goog_docs_charindex=\"7361\" href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2005-07-04/news/0507010247_1_pathetic-gov-education-budget-seniors\">Sun Sentinel</a></em> July 4, 2005, that listed several things he found &quot;pathetic&quot; in response to Bush calling the Florida Democratic Party pathetic for payroll tax lapses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; &quot;Floridians want us to fix public schools not push some right wing agenda to privatize schools.&quot; Gelber was quoted in the <em>Miami Herald </em>Feb. 16, 2006, in an article about Bush calling for a constitutional amendment on private school vouchers about a month after the Florida Supreme Court tossed out the state&#39;s first voucher program as unconstitutional.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; &quot;We are funding vouchers while rolling back Bright Futures.&quot; Gelber was quoted in the <em><a goog_docs_charindex=\"7972\" href=\"http://www.dangelber.com/news/view_news.php?ID=328\">Tampa Tribune</a></em> March 30, 2010, in a story about the Democratic attorney general primary race.
