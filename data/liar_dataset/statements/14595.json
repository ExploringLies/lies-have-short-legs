As of this writing, there is no evidence any of that is true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the website Neon Nettle claimed that an eyewitness to the shooting reported &quot;multiple gunmen dressed as security guards.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As the mainstream media in the US attempts to lock down the &lsquo;crazy lone wolf gunman&rsquo; narrative for the devastating shooting attack in Las Vegas, the truth has started to seep through foreign news outlets who don&#39;t follow the same political agenda as the American MSM,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.neon-nettle.com/news/2854-las-vegas-shooting-witnesses-report-multiple-gunmen-dressed-as-security-guards\">post</a>, dated Oct. 3, 2017, reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post goes on to tell the story of Brian Hodge, an Australian who was reportedly staying on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, the same floor as the shooter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story talks about an Oct. 2 interview Hodge gave to the <em><a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/las-vegas-shooting-queensland-eyewitness-to-mandalay-attack/news-story/17c907f4046f30ccfedf831e27e93cc8\">Courier Mail</a>,</em> an Australian tabloid. In that article, Hodge said he hid in the bushes outside the casino hotel until police arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us,&quot; Hodge is quoted as saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, Hodge said: &quot;My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are some reports a security guard was shot, we are unable to confirm if that&rsquo;s accurate. And while Hodge is quoted as saying shooters plural, there is no evidence he&rsquo;d have any way of knowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Hodge gave an interview to the <em><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/world/hardcore-las-vegas-shooter-in-room-next-door-says-australian-man-brian-hodge-20171002-gysy9v.html\">Sydney Morning Herald</a></em> in which he more fully describes what he saw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hodge told that newspaper that he never made it to his room on the 32nd floor and after hearing the bullets he first went to a casino kitchen before hiding in a bush outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was just laying on the ground. It was like a scene from a movie. The shooter was up above, we didn&#39;t know where they were... I didn&#39;t want anyone to know where I was, so I just curled up and hid. It was the most terrifying moment of my life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hodge also posted on Facebook, &quot;There is a live shooter with a gun in my hotel in Vegas right now, but I got outside safely and hiding in bushes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly for this fact-check, it&rsquo;s clear to us the Neon Nettle post puts words in Hodge&rsquo;s mouth. Hodge never said in the <em>Courier Mail </em>article nor in any other article or social media post that the security guard was a shooter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he also disputed saying shooters.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>An online blog claims, &quot;Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story tracks back to real interviews given by a person who says he was at Mandalay Bay.
