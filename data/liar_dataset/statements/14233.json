There is no date provided for the decision, and we could not find any legislation relating to such news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is because Jamaica is its own country, declaring its independence from the United Kingdom and creating its own constitution in 1962. The United States then established diplomatic relations with the country and has maintained them to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump met with Jamaican Ambassador to the United States Audrey Marks in early April, when they discussed bilateral trade, but they made no mention of Jamaica becoming a U.S. territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story seems to prey on common geographical ignorance; we couldn&rsquo;t help noticing during our research that a frequently googled question is whether Jamaica is located in the United States. The fourth-largest island in the Caribbean is in fact located about 90 miles south of Cuba. The country does not require visas for visits under six months, but it does require passports from U.S. citizens and permanent residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rumor dates back to February of this year, when Mediamaxzone.com reported falsely that the Jamaican prime minister had hinted Jamaica would become a U.S. territory. While it has been circulating for a while, it&rsquo;s time we shed light on this hoax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-19T16:04:22.019470", "ruling_date": "2017-06-19T16:59:41", "ruling_headline": "Claim that Trump welcomes Jamaica as a U.S. territory is fake news", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-jamaica-became-us-territory-fake-news", "ruling_link_text": "Jamaica is a country, not a territory", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Cnewsgo.com, <a href=\"http://cnewsgo.com/trump-welcomes-jamaica-as-a-us-territory/\">&quot;Trump welcomes Jamaica as a US territory.&quot;</a> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jamaica Information Services, <a href=\"http://jis.gov.jm/information/jamaican-history/\">&quot;Jamaican History.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of State, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2032.htm\">&quot;U.S. Relations with Jamaica,&quot;</a> Feb. 28, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JamaicaObserver.com,<a href=\"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Trump-hails-Jamaica-s-beauty_95047\"> &quot;Trump hails Jamaica&rsquo;s beauty,&quot;</a> April 8, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CIA World Factbook, <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jm.html\">&quot;Jamaica,&quot;</a> June 15, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediamaxzone.com, <a href=\"http://www.mediamaxzone.com/jamaica-on-its-way-to-becoming-a-territory-of-the-united-states-hints-the-pm-andrew-holness/\">&quot;Jamaica on its way to becoming a territory of the United States hints the PM Andrew Holness,&quot;</a> Feb. 17, 2017.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Trump welcomes Jamaica as a U.S. territory&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a blog post", "statement_date": "2017-06-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
