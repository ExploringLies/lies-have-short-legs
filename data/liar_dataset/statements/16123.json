Users on <a href=\"http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/191117958/psyop-confirmed\">message boards like 4Chan</a> have pointed out that it&rsquo;s possibly a North Carolina soccer coach named Israel Hernandez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, it appears Sayoc did have a personal relationship with a man named Israel &quot;Izzy&quot; Hernandez: They were soccer buddies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times reported that Sayoc attended Brevard College in North Carolina, &quot;for a year beginning in the fall of 1980 and played on the soccer team but did not graduate, according to a spokeswoman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://library.digitalnc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/yearbooks/id/2420/rec/43\">digital archive of Brevard College&rsquo;s 1981 yearbook</a>, &quot;The Pertelote,&quot; a student named Cesar Sayoc appears on pages 152 and 155, in a team photo and playing soccer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The caption of one photo reads, &quot;Cesar Sayoc extends after a shot to the goal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A student named Cesar Sayoc also appears in <a href=\"https://library.digitalnc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/yearbooks/id/2439/rec/233\">Brevard College&rsquo;s 1982 yearbook</a> on pages 77 and 136, again in photos of the school&rsquo;s soccer team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Sayoc&rsquo;s arrest, former Brevard College <a href=\"https://www.wral.com/news/local/video/17949380/\">soccer coach Don Scarborough</a> on Oct. 26 <a href=\"https://www.wral.com/news/national_world/national/video/17949096/\">spoke to WRAL-TV</a> &nbsp;NBC affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina, about his experience coaching Sayoc. In it, Scarborough mentions that North Carolina Soccer Hall of Famer Israel &quot;Izzy&quot; Hernandez was on the same team as Sayoc and that the two were &quot;friends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cesar was just one of the guys. I mean looking back on it, I think that soccer team that he was on for two years was the best family and the only family that maybe he had during his life.
