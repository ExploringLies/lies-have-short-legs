Ben Cardin, D-Md., whether the Democrats&rsquo; made a strategic mistake deciding to filibuster Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination. Cardin said both parties are to blame, noting that Republicans engaged in the same type of action during President Barack Obama&rsquo;s first term, when Republicans held up Obama&rsquo;s judicial nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate,&quot; Cardin said <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/04/09/exclusive-general-h-r-mcmaster-on-decision-to-strike-syria.html\">April 9</a>. &quot;Both sides have blame here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard a similar claim on ABC&rsquo;s <em>This Week</em>. Former DNC pollster Cornell Belcher said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell &quot;who blocked more of President Obama&#39;s nominees than have been blocked in history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that so?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Defining, counting filibusters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardin used the term &quot;filibuster,&quot; but measuring filibusters is troublesome, experts say, because it has an overly broad meaning. Senators tend to consider any type of obstruction to scheduling a nomination or measure as a filibuster, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The whole use of the term filibuster is problematic, given its evolution over the years,&quot; added University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis. &quot;It ends up being a regular event, used all the more frequently in more partisan Congresses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, experts say a way to approximate &mdash; but not entirely count &mdash; filibusters is to count the number of times the Senate attempts to break a filibuster by forcing an up-or-down vote through a process called cloture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, a cloture motion required the approval of 60 senators. But in 2013, Democrats changed the rules so that a simple majority could invoke cloture for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/us/politics/filibuster-supreme-court-neil-gorsuch.html\">presidential appointments and lower court nominees</a>. The 60-vote threshold stood for legislation and the Supreme Court. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To confirm Gorsuch, Republicans eliminated the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees. It remains in place for legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the research shows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardin&rsquo;s claim stems from a <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/83d4b792-d34b-4215-be6d-4a3c4e976d2b.pdf\">2013 report</a> by the Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress. The document, along with a subsequent <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/838702-crs-filibuster-report.html\">memorandum on the report</a>, lists every instance in which a presidential nominee was blocked and cloture was filed through Nov. 20, 2013, when Democrats changed Senate rules. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Congressional Research Service, senators sought attempted cloture action on judicial nominations approximately&nbsp;86 times between 1967 and the end of 2013. (Pre-1967, the Congressional Research Service lists no cloture attempts -- so &quot;history&quot; as Cardin put it, is relatively short.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those, 50 were made before President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and 36 were made between 2009 and when the Senate changed its rules in 2013.&nbsp;Miguel A. Estrada, a judge nominated in 2001 to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, saw seven cloture attempts to break a logjam by Senate Democrats before withdrawing his nomination in 2003.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So through that prism, Cardin is off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardin is closer if you look at individual judicial nominees who were subject to a cloture filing (because nominees like Estrada were subject to a cloture filing multiple times). Pre-Obama, 36 judicial nominees were subject to a cloture filing, we found. From 2009-2013, it was the same -- 36 judicial nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put that in perspective, and to see Cardin&#39;s point, look at it this way: Less than one nominee per year was subject to a cloture filing in&nbsp;the 40 years before Obama took office. From 2009-13, the number of nominees subject to a cloture filing jumped to over seven per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was much closer to being correct when he said, &quot;In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents.&quot; His figure included non-judicial nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of that fact-check we noted that &quot;By our calculation, there were actually 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama&rsquo;s term, for a total of 147.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate Democrats&nbsp;made that same point in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSenFloor/status/850012006547689472\">tweet April 6</a>. (Cardin&#39;s team said Sen. Chuck Schumer&#39;s inquiry on the Senate floor was the basis of Cardin&#39;s claim.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardin said, &quot;We&rsquo;ve seen more filibusters on judicial nominees by the Republicans under President Obama than we saw in the whole history of the United States Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardin used an imprecise term, &quot;filibuster,&quot; to describe a precise Senate parliamentary procedure, &quot;cloture.&quot; As&nbsp;far as cloture data kept by the Congressional Research Service,&nbsp;Cardin would be on safer ground if he avoided focusing on &quot;judicial&quot; nominees. By our count, cloture was filed on 36 judicial nominations during the first five years of Obama&#39;s presidency, the same total&nbsp;as the previous 40 years combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-09T10:22:21.044157", "ruling_date": "2017-04-09T18:36:16", "ruling_headline": "Did Senate Republicans filibuster Obama court nominees more than all others combined?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-senate-republicans-filibuster-obama-court-nomi", "ruling_link_text": "Would've been safer dropping 'judicial'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Steven Smith, political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, April 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Burdett Loomis, University of Kansas political scientist, April 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Sarah Binder, professor of political science, George Washington University, April 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone, email exchange, Sue Walitsky, Communications director for Sen.
