Today, he said he wanted to &lsquo;beat the living crap out of&rsquo; his Republican opponent during their debate, at a campaign rally in Marmet.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WVSen?src=hash\"> #WVSen</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweet linked to an <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/manchin-took-every-bit-discipline-not-beat-living-crap-republican-opponent/\">article</a> in the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, that included verbatim text from the campaign appearance in Marmet, W.Va., as well as an <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Manchin-Beat-the-Crap.m4a\">audio clip</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what Manchin said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;You might have seen the debate the other night. (Applause) I want to tell you something. It took every bit of my discipline not to beat the living crap out of them. You don&#39;t come to someone&#39;s state. You don&#39;t come in here and not knowing who we are and just be spewing out horrible things. Every other word was trust, liberal, trust, dishonest, and I&#39;m thinking, &lsquo;Trust?&#39; Here&#39;s a man who ran for Congress, Patrick Morrisey ran for Congress in New Jersey in 2000. He ran in the primary and got beat, only got 9 percent of the vote. Who trusts who?&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrissey picked up on the &quot;beat the living crap&quot; remark, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorriseyWV/status/1058787347641368576\">tweeting</a> that &quot;the national media should look at so-called Mr. Civility in action.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the West Virginia Republican Party&rsquo;s tweet twisted Manchin&rsquo;s words by not reporting his entire remark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Marmet, Manchin did express his frustration with Morrisey&rsquo;s attacks in the recent debate -- enough frustration to feel an impulse to &quot;beat the living crap out of&quot; his opponent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the tweet leaves out an element of what Manchin said -- that &quot;it took every bit of my discipline&quot; not to do it. In other words, by the time he was speaking in Marmet, he had already extinguished that impulse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, even what Manchin did say does seem to conflict with a prior pledge in favor of civility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2018, Manchin <a href=\"https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-pledges-to-return-to-era-of-bipartisan-cooperation-and-agreement-\">took to the Senate floor</a> to pledge &quot;an era of bipartisan cooperation and agreement in order to restore civility to the United States Senate and our political discourse.&quot; Manchin urged his colleagues to join him in co-signing his pledge and &quot;taking the first step to show the American people that they are here to work towards a better United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, &quot;What did Joe Manchin say about civility? Today, he said he wanted to &lsquo;beat the living crap out of&rsquo; his Republican opponent during their debate, at a campaign rally in Marmet.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WVSen?src=hash\"> #WVSen</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This uses a portion of Manchin&rsquo;s remarks, leaving out the fact that Manchin had prefaced that comment by saying, &quot;It took every bit of my discipline not to&quot; beat up Morrisey. That said, even the substance of what Manchin did say conflicts with a high-profile civility pledge he made in February 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweet needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-05T09:03:49.989392", "ruling_date": "2018-11-05T11:53:14", "ruling_headline": "What did Joe Manchin say about beating up Patrick Morrisey?", "ruling_headline_slug": "what-did-joe-manchin-say-about-beating-patrick-mor", "ruling_link_text": "Leaves out part of the remark", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>West Virginia Republican Party, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WVGOP/status/1058872491878375424\">tweet</a>, Nov. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Free Beacon, &quot;<a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/manchin-took-every-bit-discipline-not-beat-living-crap-republican-opponent/\">Manchin: &lsquo;It Took Every Bit of My Discipline Not to Beat the Living Crap Out&rsquo; of Republican Opponent</a>,&quot; Nov. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Free Beacon, <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Manchin-Beat-the-Crap.m4a\">audio clip of Joe Manchin</a>, published Nov. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick Morrissey, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorriseyWV/status/1058787347641368576\">tweet</a>, Nov. 3, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "State party organization", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "West Virginia", "id": 4400, "last_name": "West Virginia Republican Party", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "west-virginia-republican-party", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/WVGOP_logo.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4400/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 4, "website": "https://wvgop.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;What did Joe Manchin say about civility?
