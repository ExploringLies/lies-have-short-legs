In his address, the president focused on the $447 billion <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/09/10/business/economy/20110910-the-american-jobs-act.html?ref=economy\">American Jobs Act</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tBaldwin&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.channel3000.com/politics/29220277/detail.html\">comments in favor of the Jobs Act </a>on Sept. 17, 2011 at a Madison rally dubbed &quot;Fighting Bob Fest&quot; after Progressive icon Robert La Follette.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Jobs Act is separate from Obama&rsquo;s broader &quot;Long-Term Deficit Reduction Plan,&quot; which would raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for the jobs bill and help fund a 10-year drive to reduce federal deficits by some $3 trillion. The president touted the principles of that plan in the same speech where the Jobs Act was unveiled but did not lay out the details until Sept. 19, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat announcement was what prompted the NRSC release -- and where the timing gets interesting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBond said because the Jobs Act and Obama&rsquo;s long term deficit reduction plan were linked in the initial speech and have somewhat overlapping funding sources, it&rsquo;s fair to say Baldwin supports the White House&rsquo;s deficit-reduction plan and the $1.5 trillion in tax increases to pay for it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is one big policy rollout that they are doing,&quot; Bond said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s look at the record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin indeed praised the Jobs Act -- specifically Obama&rsquo;s focus on creating construction jobs to erect public infrastructure so America doesn&rsquo;t &quot;sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/legislativeissues/economy/2011/09/baldwin-agrees-its-time-we-take-bold-action.shtml\">press </a><a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/legislativeissues/economy/2011/09/baldwin-agrees-its-time-we-take-bold-action.shtml\">statement </a>the night of the president&rsquo;s speech on jobs and deficits was both broad (praising his call for &quot;bold action&quot;) and specific (citing the Jobs Act infrastructure plan).

Those are the ones that tally out to $1.5 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe could not find any public comments by Baldwin in favor of the large package of tax hikes -- the one the NRSC says Baldwin is backing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Bond if he had evidence that Baldwin was specifically endorsing the tax package.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I haven&rsquo;t seen any politician say that,&quot; he told us. &quot;She hasn&rsquo;t done it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin&rsquo;s campaign confirmed this in an email: &quot;While Tammy Baldwin applauds the President&rsquo;s plan to create jobs, she hasn&rsquo;t taken a position on the (deficit-plan) revenue package and is concerned about some of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that have been proposed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama&rsquo;s deficit plan <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20108364-503544.html\">drew public </a><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20108364-503544.html\">praise </a>from some liberal Democrats, especially the new minimum tax rate for individuals making more than $1 million a year, the so-called <a href=\"about:blank\">Warren Buffett rule</a>.

She may ultimately side with many of Obama&rsquo;s ideas, which were sent to the congressional &quot;super committee&quot; that is to propose a major debt plan late this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the NRSC itself acknowledges Baldwin has not endorsed Obama&rsquo;s deficit plan, which is a much broader proposal than the Jobs Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-22T10:45:20.873242", "ruling_date": "2011-09-23T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Republican group says Rep.
