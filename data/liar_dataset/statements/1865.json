It's the fault of our  leaders who talk a good game about education but do nothing. In fact,  they do worse than nothing. Whenever the politicians go looking for  money to fund their pet projects, guess where they get it? They cut  education!\"<br /><strong><br /></strong>In his speech, the outgoing attorney general  gave us plenty of red meat to chew on. We decided to take a look into  his claim about school test scores. Is Georgia \"right at the bottom\"?<br /><br />Baker  campaign official Edward Chapman was happy to tell us where his boss  came up with that statement: an <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> article last year reporting how Georgia's students fared on the SAT.<br /><br />\"Georgia  finished ahead of only South Carolina, Hawaii, Maine and the District  of Columbia,\" the Aug. 30, 2009, article reported. (That may not be  something to boast about, but Georgia's students ranked last in the  nation in 2004, so they've improved.)<br /><br />So, with the caveat that  educators often warn against state comparisons because of wide  variations in the types of students who take the tests, yes, the SAT  alone indicates Georgia is close to the bottom. But we decided to look  at scores on another college admission test -- the ACT. (There's a  caveat with this one, too, because a smaller percentage of Georgia  students take it than in many other states.)<br /><br />Georgia fared better  here. It ranked ahead of 10 states and the District of Columbia in the  average ACT composite score. <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Another element of the ACT</span></span> measures  the percentage of students who passed its benchmark scores in English,  math, reading and science. On this one, Georgia finished 38th, ahead of  13 others states, and just below students in the District of Columbia.<br /><br />Baker  campaign officials still contend their candidate's statement is true  because more Georgia students take the SAT as opposed to the ACT. \"We  have always been at or very near the bottom among the states,\" Chapman  said.<br style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\" /><br />So overall,  Georgia's test scores on the two main college entrance exams paint  different pictures. On the SAT, the state ranked 47th. But on the ACT,  the state was 38th or 40th. So it's not, as Baker said, \"right at the  bottom.\" We find his claim Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-07T15:27:49.670809", "ruling_date": "2010-06-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Baker says test scores show Georgia failing students", "ruling_headline_slug": "baker-says-test-scores-show-georgia-failing-studen", "ruling_link_text": "Baker's test score claim doesn't completely add up.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Thurbert Baker <a href=\"http://www.thurbertbaker.com/from_the_campaign/details/24\" target=\"_blank\">campaign kickoff speech</a>, April 29, 2010.<br /><br />Georgia students lag on SAT test, Atlanta  Journal-Constitution, Aug. 30, 2009<br /><br />ACT College readiness  benchmark <a href=\"http://www.act.org/news/data/09/collegeready.html\" target=\"_blank\">scores</a>.<br /><br />Telephone  interview with Baker campaign official Edward Chapman, May 20, 2010<br /><br />Telephone  interview with ACT spokesman Ed Colby, May 20, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Thurbert", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 444, "last_name": "Baker", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "thurbert-baker", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ThurbertBaker.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/444/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\"Our school test scores are right at the bottom.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2010-04-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Thurbert", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 444, "last_name": "Baker", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "thurbert-baker", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ThurbertBaker.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/444/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
