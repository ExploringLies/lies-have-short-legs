Our efforts to reach the writer were unsuccessful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why would Brazile have to fear for her life after the Rich murder &mdash; if, as we&rsquo;ve been told, it was simply a robbery gone bad?&quot; states the article. &quot;Does she suspect someone of the murder?

Likely not, but we still didn&rsquo;t know.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brazile dismissed the WikiLeaks conspiracy theory:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some Trump supporters were promoting the baseless conspiracy theory that Seth had been murdered by the DNC because he was the one who had leaked our emails to WikiLeaks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to contact Brazile through her website but did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline on the US Political website states &quot;Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons.&quot; The article refers to Brazile&rsquo;s book in which she speculates on the motivations behind the DNC staffer&rsquo;s murder, but she doesn&rsquo;t point the finger at the Clintons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-15T15:59:20.381027", "ruling_date": "2017-11-15T16:04:18", "ruling_headline": "Fake headline says Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by Clintons", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-headline-says-donna-brazile-knows-seth-rich-w", "ruling_link_text": "Another Seth Rich conspiracy theory", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>US Political, <a href=\"http://uspolitical.org/donna-brazile-knows-seth-rich-was-murdered-by-the-clintons/\">&quot;Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons,&quot;</a> Nov. 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Clear Politics, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/11/09/donna_brazile_i_hope_to_god_we_find_out_who_murdered_seth_rich.html\">&quot;Donna Brazile: &lsquo;I Hope To God We Find Out Who Murdered Seth Rich,&rsquo;&quot; </a>Nov. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google books, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=s8YrDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Donna+Brazile&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1gIXv2MDXAhXK7SYKHbQJB5sQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=had%20he%20been%20killed%20by%20someone%20who%20had%20it%20out%20for%20the%20Democrats%3F%20Likely%20not%2C%20but%20we%20still%20didn%E2%80%99t%20know.&amp;f=false\">&quot;Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House,&quot; </a>Nov. 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>L.A.
