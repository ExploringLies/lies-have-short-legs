It is the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin. It surpassed traffic crashes quite a few years ago already.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it true that overdoses from heroin or prescription opioids not only outnumber traffic fatalities, but are the top cause of accidental deaths in Wisconsin?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The statistics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/overdose/facts.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>latest figures</u></a> from the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nationally, there were 41,340 fatal drug overdoses of all types in 2011, making it the leading cause of injury death in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about in Wisconsin? When we asked Schimel&rsquo;s campaign about his claim, Schimel replied in an email that he had misspoken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told us he meant to say that the number of all drug overdose deaths in Wisconsin -- not just heroin and prescription opioid deaths -- exceed the number of motor vehicle deaths and are the top cause of accidental deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/P4/p45368-12.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the latest report</u></a> from the state Department of Health Services, which said there were 2,789 accidental deaths in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The leading cause was 1,091 falls (which also was the leading cause in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p4/p45368-11.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to</u></a> the department).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 615 motor vehicle deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same number of deaths -- 615-- was caused by &quot;accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those 615 included deaths caused by a variety of drugs, as well as other substances such as alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, we obtained figures from the health department showing there were 511 opioid deaths in Wisconsin in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That included 187 heroin deaths, up from 27 in 2002.
