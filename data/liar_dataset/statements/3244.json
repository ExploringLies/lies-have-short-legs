The last time military force was used against workers was during the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968, just days before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s assassination. It must not be repeated again.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker certainly anticipated a strong reaction from government employees to his plans to strip bargaining rights and increase their contributions to pensions and health care premiums.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut did he threaten to call out the National Guard in response to protests?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd did he threaten to use them in this manner, to use force to &quot;impose his personal, political will&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike the progressive committee, <a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1\">Citizen Action of </a><a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1\">Wisconsin</a> issued a <a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/images/stories/Press_Releases/prwalkerthreattousenationalguardshockingandexteme2-14-11.doc.pdf\">news </a><a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/images/stories/Press_Releases/prwalkerthreattousenationalguardshockingandexteme2-14-11.doc.pdf\">release</a> the same day that condemned Walker&rsquo;s &quot;threat of force&quot; and mentioned the King assassination.

We have updated those,&quot; Walker said. &quot;I got a full briefing from all the major, level-one state agencies as well as the<br />\r\n\tthe National Guard yesterday (Feb. 10). We are fully prepared and equipped to handle whatever may occur. So we have every confidence we can move forward on that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But again, you plan for the worst, you expect the best. And I expect from the good men and women who work for state and local government that they&rsquo;re going to continue to do the good, professional job they do each and every day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReferring to the Guard, he added:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They&rsquo;re not called up at this point. We obviously have a whole series of circumstances that would lead to that. I&rsquo;m not anticipating that, I&rsquo;m not expecting that, but I want to make everyone certain in this state that I&rsquo;m fully prepared for whatever may happen.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen he spoke later that day to Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, Walker used the example of the National Guard helping run state prisons in the event of a strike by corrections workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie wrote: &nbsp;&quot;In the unlikely event that core government services are disrupted the Guard would be used just to continue those services. That&rsquo;s what the National Guard does.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, demonstrations over Walker&rsquo;s proposals were held in Madison and elsewhere in Wisconsin on Feb. 14 and 15, with thousands of people showing up, but the National Guard was not summoned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd on Feb. 15, the Guard issued a <a href=\"http://dma.wi.gov/dma/news/2011News/11021.asp\">news </a><a href=\"http://dma.wi.gov/dma/news/2011News/11021.asp\">release</a> saying it &quot;has not been mobilized for state active duty&quot; and &quot;we remain in our normal state of readiness.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s return to the statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Progressive Change Campaign Committee said Walker &quot;threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against these cuts!&quot; The governor spoke of possibly calling up the Guard if state workers didn&rsquo;t show up for work, but he made no reference to using it in response to protests. And certainly none that would suggest the Guard is authorized to use force to impose anything on state workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-16T14:37:22.691263", "ruling_date": "2011-02-16T13:34:16", "ruling_headline": "Group says Gov.
