He then took the economic comparison further -- all the way to the Pacific Northwest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world,&quot; Villaraigosa said. &quot;If you add the GDP&rsquo;s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s power &ndash; power we must use to protect our people against any dangerous policies advanced by a Trump administration,&quot; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact-check the part of Villaraigosa&rsquo;s claim that if the GDPs of California, Washington and Oregon were somehow combined, they&rsquo;d represent the fifth largest economy on the planet, ahead of the United Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gross domestic product, or GDP, is used to measure the health of a country&rsquo;s or state&rsquo;s economy. It&rsquo;s the total value of all goods and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A campaign spokeswoman for Villaraigosa pointed us to 2015 GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used the same data in July to verify that California, with a GDP of nearly $2.5 trillion, had the sixth-largest economy behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/8078657/CA%20world%20GDP%20rankings.JPG\" style=\"height:665px; width:413px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>California Gov. Jerry Brown&rsquo;s administration&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Economics/Indicators/Gross_State_Product/\">released GDP figures</a>&nbsp;in June showing the state had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our July fact check, we noted that when adjusted for California&rsquo;s very high cost of living, the state&rsquo;s GDP drops several places. This led us to our Mostly True rating for the claim, which we define as &quot;accurate but needs clarification or additional information.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To come up with a combined GDP for three West Coast states, we added California&rsquo;s nearly $2.5 trillion to Oregon&rsquo;s $217 billion and Washington&rsquo;s $445 billion, using 2015 figures from the <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/drilldown.cfm?reqid=70&amp;stepnum=11&amp;AreaTypeKeyGdp=5&amp;GeoFipsGdp=XX&amp;ClassKeyGdp=NAICS&amp;ComponentKey=200&amp;IndustryKey=1&amp;YearGdp=2015Q2&amp;YearGdpBegin=-1&amp;YearGdpEnd=-1&amp;UnitOfMeasureKeyGdp=Levels&amp;RankKeyGdp=1&amp;Drill=1&amp;nRange=5\">U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, their GDPs add up to $3.1 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hypothetical West Coast powerhouse economy would be larger than the United Kingdom&rsquo;s $2.8 trillion GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Villaraigosa&rsquo;s claim, however, needs the same disclaimer about high cost of living. California, Oregon and Washington are all expensive places to live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We realize Villaraigosa&rsquo;s comparison is hypothetical -- and it looks like he got his numbers right. But to do this, he creates a fictional California economy that magically annexes the GDPs of two nearby states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonio Villaraigosa recently said: &quot;California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world. If you add the GDP&rsquo;s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated the first portion of this claim Mostly True in a separate fact check in July. We crunched the numbers on the second part of Villaraigosa&rsquo;s claim, about a combined and hypothetical California-Oregon-Washington economy. At $3.1 trillion, it would surpass the United Kingdom&rsquo;s $2.8 trillion GDP and would rank fifth in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that some economists factor in cost-of-living when assessing a state&rsquo;s or country&rsquo;s GDP. Expenses are high in all three states, which means this mega-economy could be knocked down a few spots in the rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former mayor&rsquo;s statement needs this clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, we rate Villaraigosa&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE</em></strong> &ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b83a74d-fde6-48d9-9c72-c93824f92b4e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b83a74d-fde6-48d9-9c72-c93824f92b4e</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-14T00:33:42.207874", "ruling_date": "2016-12-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Would trio of West Coast states be '5th largest economy' on planet?\u00a0", "ruling_headline_slug": "villaraigosa-claims-california-oregon-washington-p", "ruling_link_text": "It's a fanciful comparison, but numbers are right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Antonio Villaraigosa,&nbsp;op-ed,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article119510813.html\">Uniting cities and states to protect our values, leverage policies</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sacramento Bee,</em> Dec. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview,&nbsp;Michelle Jeung, campaign spokeswoman for Antonio Villaraigosa, Dec. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International Monetary Fund, <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/weodata/index.aspx\">World Economic Outlook Database</a>, accessed December 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/definitions.cfm?did=2200&amp;reqId=70\" onclick=\"getDefinition(2200, 70, this); return false;\" target=\"_blank\">Gross domestic product by state</a>, accessed December 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact California, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/jul/26/kevin-de-leon/does-california-really-have-sixth-largest-economy-/\">Does California really have the &#39;6th largest economy on planet Earth?&#39;</a>, July 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Department of Finance,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Economics/Indicators/Gross_State_Product/\">Gross State Product</a>, Comparison to Other Major Countries, accessed December 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "candidate for California governor", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Antonio ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "California", "id": 3775, "last_name": "Villaraigosa", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "antonio-villaraigosa", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Antonio_Villaraigosa_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3775/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world.
