Charlie Crist is trying to pump up his conservative credentials.</p>\r\n<p>In a new radio advertisement for his campaign, he says, &quot;Here in Florida, I&rsquo;ve slashed government by 10 percent. That&rsquo;s $7 billion.&quot; It&rsquo;s a statement Crist has also made on the campaign trail, and at a Hillsborough County Republican Party fundraiser earlier this month.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that Florida&rsquo;s budget has dropped by 10 percent, or about $7 billion, since Crist was elected governor in November 2006. The budget passed by the Legislature and approved by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in May 2006 came in at $73.9 billion. This year&rsquo;s spending plan tops out at $66.5 billion.</p>\r\n<p>But can Crist, as his radio ad claims, really take credit for the cuts?</p>\r\n<p>In 2007, Crist did veto $459 million from the state budget, setting a state record with his veto pen.</p>\r\n<p>But the Florida Constitution requires that state lawmakers prepare a balanced budget, which is built around revenue generated by sales taxes, corporate taxes, other taxes and fees, and federal appropriations.</p>\r\n<p>And since 2007, that revenue has declined significantly as the nationwide recession has taken hold. State budget documents show that in the 2006-2007 fiscal year, $31.7 billion was available in the general revenue fund. This year, the fund had only $21.9 billion. (In fiscal year 2007, the fund had $28 billion, and in 2008, it had $24.3 billion.)</p>\r\n<p>With revenue down and a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget, Crist had to either cut spending or raise taxes.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;This is not a concerted effort on the part of our governor and Legislature to cut the budget,&quot; said Dominic M. Calabro, president and CEO of Florida TaxWatch. &quot;It is because of the worst economy Florida has had since the Great Depression.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Crist has defended the budget-cut claim by saying that in other states, taxes were increased to cover shortfalls. While Crist didn&rsquo;t push for tax increases to make up the entire shortfall, he did approve fee and tax increases this year &mdash; on everything from fishing licenses to initial vehicle registrations to cigarettes &mdash; that total $2.2 billion.</p>\r\n<p>So while it is true that state government has shrunk by 10 percent since Crist&rsquo;s election, it had little to do with him, and a lot to do with the shrinking economy. For those reasons, we give Crist&rsquo;s statement a Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
