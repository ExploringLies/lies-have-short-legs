Chris Christie.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAnd those steps have already yielded significant results, he claimed recently.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008,&quot; Christie said during his monthly &quot;Ask the Governor&quot; program that aired April 22 on NJ101.5 FM.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie&rsquo;s claim is a variation on one he made in January, also during that month&rsquo;s &quot;Ask the Governor&quot; program, when he tied the 2008 budget to Democratic predecessor Jon Corzine. Now he&rsquo;s also tying it to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie in November&rsquo;s gubernatorial election.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAs we determined in a February fact-check, state spending is down since 2008, but Christie ignores that spending has still increased with each new state budget since he took office on Jan. 19, 2010.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review the numbers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that Christie first made the comparison of his administration spending less than Corzine&rsquo;s between the fiscal 2008 and 2013 budgets, so we&rsquo;ll look at those two years first. The spending difference was $1.5 billion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFor fiscal year 2008, spending was $33.6 billion, according to Treasury department reports.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie&rsquo;s budget for fiscal year 2013 contained $32.1 billion in spending.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo Christie is correct that spending on his watch is below what Corzine spent, but the governor&rsquo;s spending isn&rsquo;t so innocent, either.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie&rsquo;s first budget for fiscal year 2011 was $28.4 billion. For fiscal year 2012, the governor approved a $29.6 billion budget.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie&rsquo;s fiscal year 2013 budget was $32.1 billion and his proposed fiscal year 2014 budget is $32.9 billion. So, Christie&rsquo;s budgets are lower than Corzine&rsquo;s, but they&rsquo;re still growing every year. We should note that the fiscal year 2014 blueprint is still subject to hearings and possible cuts. Christie has until July 1 to sign it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn PolitiFact New Jersey&rsquo;s February fact-check, Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn said the increased spending since fiscal year 2011 was due in part to Christie&rsquo;s policies boosting the state&rsquo;s economy, leading to higher tax revenues. At that time Quinn noted that two of the major areas of higher spending had been in education and pension contributions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s also another reason why Christie&rsquo;s budgets have spent less than the ones crafted on Corzine&rsquo;s watch: Corzine used more money for property tax relief than Christie. Also, Christie imposed a 2-percent cap on spending that didn&rsquo;t exist when Corzine ran the state.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAdditionally, although Christie ties Buono in to the fiscal year 2008 budget, she did not chair the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in 2007, the year that Corzine&rsquo;s spending plan was created. Buono chaired that panel in 2008 and 2009, when the fiscal years 2009 and 2010 budgets were created.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSaid David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, in an e-mail: &quot;The Governor would rather rewrite history than own up to cutting property tax relief, slashing education aid and reducing the Earned Income Tax Credit.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn responding to a caller during New Jersey 101.5&rsquo;s &quot;Ask the Governor&quot; program last month, Christie claimed, &quot;We&rsquo;re spending less money today, in upcoming fiscal year 2014 than the Corzine-Buono budget spent in fiscal year 2008.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie is correct that the proposed fiscal year 2014 budget of $32.9 billion is less than the level of state spending under Corzine in fiscal year 2008, at $33.6 billion. But Christie&rsquo;s claim leaves out some details.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFirst, state spending has increased every year that Christie has been governor. Second, he ties the higher-spending budgets in part to Buono, but she did not chair the Senate budget panel that crafted the fiscal year 2008 budget.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOverall, Christie&rsquo;s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That makes it Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/politifact_nj_chris_christie_c.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-02T14:04:52.762490", "ruling_date": "2013-05-05T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie says spending in proposed FY14 budget still below Jon Corzine's, Barbara Buono's FY08 budget", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-says-spending-proposed-fy14-budget-", "ruling_link_text": "Spending's down, but also up", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-3f5e309d-666a-8be2-1f93-626f9da2a6d0\">\r\n\tNJ1015.com, Ask the Governor, April 15, 2013, accessed April 16, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNorthJersey.com, <a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/news/state/budget/Christie_backs_off_bold_prediction_for_NJ_economic_growth.html\">Christie backs off bold prediction for N.J. economic growth</a>, March 4, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNew Jersey Treasury Department website, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/omb/publications/14bib/BIB.pdf\">The Fiscal Year 2014 Budget, New Jersey: Recover.
