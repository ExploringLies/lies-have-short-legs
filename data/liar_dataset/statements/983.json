A day later in an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/arena/perm/Fred_Barbash_381C9F8E-EE8C-4F98-8D87-D8A92AF9E24F.html\" target=\"_blank\"> online chat </a> the former House speaker said Obama&#39;s response to a recent North Korean missile test was &quot;a vivid demonstration of weakness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olbermann mentioned these criticisms, playing a clip of the first, then turned to O&#39;Donnell for a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, we don&#39;t have similar clips to show from 2006 in October, the last time North Korea launched one of these things under President Bush&#39;s watch,&quot; said O&#39;Donnell, a former Senate staffer, Huffington Post blogger and executive producer of <em> The West Wing </em> . &quot;There are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Olbermann said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were less willing than Olbermann to take O&#39;Donnell at his word. So we checked what Gingrich said in October 2006, after North Korea announced it had detonated a nuclear device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s Gingrich talking about the incident on <em> Hannity &amp; Colmes </em> on Oct. 10, 2006:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We may wake up one morning and lose Seattle or San Francisco or Atlanta or Boston,&quot; Gingrich said. &quot;And that&#39;s far too serious to just degenerate into pointing fingers at each other. And, yet, I don&#39;t sense any -- I don&#39;t sense any real willingness, and I say this about both parties. I mean, this would be a great moment for the president to invite all the senior Democrats in the House and Senate into a White House meeting to sit down and say, &#39;First of all, our analysts were wrong. Second, our intelligence didn&#39;t know where to look. We&#39;re not even certain the first weapon was a nuclear weapon.&#39; The Japanese now report a second test. I mean, this ought to be seen as a very substantial crisis of national security.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m not defending the administration here,&quot; Gingrich emphasized later in the program. &quot;This is not a pro-Bush comment. I&#39;m saying I think we, as Americans, are up against much more serious problems than we understand. And that we are faced with a threat that literally could cost us two or three cities in the next decade.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s Gingrich a week later on <em> The O&#39;Reilly Factor </em> talking about national security:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we have to demand dramatically more,&quot; Gingrich said. &quot;We may well have to spend more on national security. But the answer is not to become weaker than President Bush. The answer is to become stronger. I&#39;m not at all comfortable, whether it&#39;s in Iraq, or in the intelligence service or dealing with North Korea or dealing with our own border. I&#39;m not comfortable with where we are right now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&#39;Reilly had not even asked specifically about North Korea. Later on the program Gingrich endorsed Bush&#39;s decision not to have one-on-one talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. But still, in the above exchange, Gingrich went out of his way to suggest Bush was too weak with respect to North Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there are at least two instances of Gingrich critiquing Bush&#39;s approach to North Korea -- exactly what O&#39;Donnell said did not happen. We find O&#39;Donnell&#39;s claim to be False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:47.612121", "ruling_date": "2009-04-07T14:37:01", "ruling_headline": "O'Donnell alleges Gingrich laid off Bush, record indicates otherwise", "ruling_headline_slug": "odonnell-alleges-gingrich-laid-bush-record-indicat", "ruling_link_text": "Turns out Gingrich went after Bush too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>HuffingtonPost.com, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-odonnell/\" target=\"_blank\"> Lawrence O&#39;Donnell bio </a> , accessed April 7, 2009&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/arena/perm/Fred_Barbash_381C9F8E-EE8C-4F98-8D87-D8A92AF9E24F.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Q&amp;A with Newt Gingrich </a> , April 6, 2009, accessed April 7, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC, <em> Countdown </em> , April 6, 2009&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News Network, <em> The O&#39;Reilly Factor </em> , Oct. 17, 2006, Newt Gingrich Weighs in on Bush Interview,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News Network, <em> Hannity &amp; Colmes </em> , Oct. 10, 2006</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Lawrence", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 151, "last_name": "O'Donnell", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "lawrence-odonnell", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/lawrence_6-15.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/151/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;There are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an appearance on MSNBC.", "statement_date": "2009-04-06", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Newt", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 152, "last_name": "Gingrich", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "newt-gingrich", "pants_count": 12, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gingrichcutter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/152/", "total_count": 86, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
