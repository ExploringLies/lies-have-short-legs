The person reporting sexual harassment must request counseling with the Office of Compliance within 180 days of the alleged harassment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>According to the posted procedures, the counseling period normally lasts 30 days. But it may be reduced at the request of the employee.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In Blunt&rsquo;s statement, he said the counseling process takes 20 hours. We were unable to confirm the number of counseling hours each person receives during the 30-day period.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>When we asked Blunt&rsquo;s office, spokesperson Katie Boyd pointed us to the Office of Compliance.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Laura Cech, the outreach and publications coordinator for the Office of Compliance, did not specify whether Blunt was correct in saying 20 hours. She responded with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compliance.gov/sites/default/files/correctingtherecord.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Q&amp;A the office developed</a>&nbsp;Nov. 13 outlining what they see as &quot;the most common misconceptions&quot; from the media about the process. The first question is about the required &quot;counseling&quot; &mdash; but it does not include how the 30-day process translates into hours.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>A counselor will &quot;discuss with an employee the information that gave rise to their concerns, and inform them of their rights under the law,&quot; the document says. It also notes the counseling can be completed over the phone or through a designated representative, such as an attorney.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Remaining steps continue after counseling if the employee still believes he or she has been sexually harassed.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The steps include a 30-day mediation where both parties are allowed the opportunity to resolve the dispute, administrative hearing or civil action, and the appeals process where the employee can request the final decision be reviewed by the OOC Board of Directors.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Sandy Davidson, a professor at the University of Missouri who teaches law in the journalism school, said, &quot;The rules are bizarre and totally unfriendly to women.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Davidson also noted the confidentiality aspect of the laws. The rules say all statements, communications and documents during the mediation process are confidential.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In Missouri, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://labor.mo.gov/mohumanrights/File_Complaint/complaint_process\" target=\"_blank\">file a complaint</a>&nbsp;with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, which investigates complaints in public accommodations about race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, age and familial status.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>There is no requirement for counseling. Once the complaint is filed, the commission investigates by interviewing both sides. If the investigator finds discrimination, the commission attempts to settle the case.
