Americans oppose it because it will decrease the quality of care, raise taxes, cut Medicare, and add trillions of dollars in debt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHealth care is certainly expensive; we wondered if the plan for mandating coverage and expanding insurance would really add that much to the debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted Hinckley&#39;s office seeking the source of their information and received no response.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt turns out that PolitiFact National has examined this claim a few times, most recently when <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-adds-trillions-deficit/\">Mitt Romney made the same statement</a> in response to the Supreme Court ruling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s the bottom line: according to the PolitiFact analysis, it&#39;s not going to add to the debt because the legislation also raises money to pay for the costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected back in 2010 that the health-care law would lower the deficit by about $124 billion over 10 years. In 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health-care law, the CBO estimated that wiping out the law, which Romney is promising to do, would actually <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/22027\">increase</a> the deficit by about $210 billion over 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe budget office acknowledges circumstances can change, the CBO isn&#39;t infallible, and the issues that come up in making an analysis can be contentious, as PolitiFact found when it looked at a statement from U.S. Rep Paul Ryan, R-Wis., judged Mostly False, that the law was &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-claims-health-care-law-accelerating-/\">accelerating our country toward bankruptcy</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow much would the new health-care law actually raise? As PolitiFact reported when it gave Rush Limbaugh a Pants On Fire for declaring that &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/rush-limbaugh/health-care-law-not-largest-tax-increase-us-histor/\">Obamacare is . . . the largest tax increase in the history of the world</a>,&quot; the CBO estimates the additional revenues coming into the<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11439/WHCC_Presentation-4-12-10.pdf\"> government will be $525 billion between now and 2019</a>. In addition, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs an aside, Obama claimed in his 2010 State of the Union speech that health-care reform &quot;would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/01/barack-obama/health-care-reform-estimates-deficit-reduction-are/\">PolitiFact rated that statement</a> as Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut for Hinckley&#39;s claim, congressional budget experts say he is wrong, so we will give it the same rating that Romney received: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
