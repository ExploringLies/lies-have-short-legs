Ted Cruz said a string of rival Sen. Marco Rubio&rsquo;s attacks at the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina were &quot;flat-out false.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One attack pinpointed Cruz&rsquo;s record on military spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget for (Sen.) Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense,&quot; Rubio said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz shook his head and said Rubio knowingly made an inaccurate claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget. Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;What he said, and he said it in the last debate, is simply not true.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-voted-defense-cuts-rand-/\">criticized Cruz&rsquo;s record</a> on military spending before, as Cruz voted for a proposed Paul budget that would have resulted in lower defense spending than current projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on his specific point about voting for Rubio&rsquo;s amendment, Cruz is right. (We&#39;re not fact-checking whether Rubio &quot;knows full well&quot; about Cruz&#39;s vote.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to counteract <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/14/politifact-sheet-our-guide-to-military-spending-/\">defense spending cuts</a> over the past few years, Rubio put forth an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/423/text\">amendment</a> to increase military spending in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-rand-paul-senate-pentagon-budget-116434\">March 2015</a>.

The measure failed 32-68.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz mentioned $697 billion, specifically, but it&rsquo;s a little unclear exactly how much Rubio&rsquo;s amendment would increase spending. On the Senate floor, Rubio said defense funds should reflect the Department of Defense&rsquo;s 2012 <a href=\"http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/178235.pdf\">fiscal year request</a>, which projected $611 billion in spending in 2016. But <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTomCotton/videos/429282833899924/\">Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.</a>, who backed the amendment, said it would increase military spending to $697 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very <a href=\"http://time.com/3759378/rand-paul-defense-spending/\">same day</a>, the Senate voted on a Paul <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/940/text\">amendment</a> that would have increased military spending to a similar level as the Rubio amendment, but it offset those costs with cuts to education, research and more. Cruz and Rubio <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00097\">both voted</a> against the amendment, and it failed 4-96.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said Rubio &quot;knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz did indeed vote for a failed Rubio amendment that would have increased military spending after years of spending cuts. &nbsp;While the amendment didn&rsquo;t specifically say spending would be increased to $697 billion, that figure was part of the discussion among the bill&rsquo;s proponents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz&rsquo;s point is right on, so we rate his statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-15T10:36:16.725942", "ruling_date": "2016-01-15T11:22:01", "ruling_headline": "Cruz is right in back-and-forth with Rubio about vote on defense spending", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-debate-cruz-says-he-voted-rubio-defense-spendi", "ruling_link_text": "He sure did", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-voted-defense-cuts-rand-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz voted for defense cuts in Rand Paul&#39;s budget,</u></a>&quot; Dec. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress.gov, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/940/text\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>S.Amdt.940 to S.Con.Res.11</u></a>, March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress.gov, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/423/text\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>S.Amdt.423 to S.Con.Res.11,</u></a> March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Time</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://time.com/3759378/rand-paul-defense-spending/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rand Paul Proposes Boosting Defense Spending,</u></a>&quot; March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-rand-paul-senate-pentagon-budget-116434\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2016 brawl breaks out on Senate floor</u></a>,&quot; March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/178235.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Defense: FY2012 Budget Request, Authorization and Appropriations</u></a>,&quot; Nov. 25, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Cotton Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SenatorTomCotton/videos/429282833899924/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate floor remarks video</u></a>, March 25, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 43, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 38, "first_name": "Ted", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1475, "last_name": "Cruz", "mostly_true_count": 22, "name_slug": "ted-cruz", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/CRUZPFTNEW.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1475/", "total_count": 141, "true_count": 7, "website": "http://www.tedcruz.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Marco Rubio &quot;knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C.", "statement_date": "2016-01-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 159, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/159/", "subject": "Voting Record", "subject_slug": "voting-record", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
