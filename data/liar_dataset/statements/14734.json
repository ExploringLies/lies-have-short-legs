She has, after all, spent her career in education - serving as a community college professor, as the state&rsquo;s superintendent of public instruction and on the boards of the University of California and California State University systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early in her campaign, the Democratic candidate has called for a &quot;reinvestment in education,&quot; including funding for universal preschool and tuition-free college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also on the topic of higher education, Eastin has claimed in recent months that California has failed to prioritize college construction in favor of prisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve built six total (college) campuses &mdash; one UC, three CSUs, two community colleges &mdash; since 1965. That&rsquo;s six campuses but 23 prisons,&quot; Eastin said in an <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/news/insight/2017/10/31/insight-103117a/\">interview with Capital Public Radio</a> on Oct. 16, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the only time Eastin has made this colleges-to-prisons comparison. In May, during her <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-U2ktUbRoOI?t=3m16s\">speech</a> at the 2017 California Democratic Party State Convention, Eastin asserted that California had built &quot;just six colleges but 22 prisons&quot; since 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was Eastin right? Has California built nearly four times as many prisons as colleges since 1965, or perhaps since 1985?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we looked at prisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The portion of Eastin&rsquo;s claim about 23 prisons built since 1965 is correct, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Prisons/docs/CA-State-Prisons-chronology.pdf\">chronological list</a> produced by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Twenty-one have opened since 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altogether, California operates 35 state prisons and houses about 129,000 inmates, according to a March 2017 <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3595\">report</a> by the California Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California is also home to 12 federal prisons. But because the state is not responsible for their construction or operation, we have decided not to include them. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Colleges</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A glance at the history of the UC and CSU systems shows Eastin is again correct, at least on this portion of her claim: The University of California at Merced opened in 2005, the lone campus in the 10-campus UC system added since 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the state has constructed three California State University campuses during this period: Cal State San Marcos in 1990, Cal State Monterey Bay in 1995 and Cal State Channel Islands in 2002. They are the newest additions to the 23-campus CSU system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found, however, a glaring error on Eastin&rsquo;s count of community colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been 41 of those campuses built since 1965 -- not the two she claimed in the radio interview. That&rsquo;s according to a list on the California Community Colleges Chancellor&rsquo;s Office <a href=\"http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/AlphaList.aspx\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>See a list of the colleges below:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://e.infogram.com/6889ac80-31d5-4b1d-921e-edb3080df424?src=embed\" title=\"California Community College Construction\" width=\"550\" height=\"1244\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none;\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><div style=\"padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px\"><a href=\"https://infogram.com/6889ac80-31d5-4b1d-921e-edb3080df424\" style=\"color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;\" target=\"_blank\">California Community College Construction</a><br><a href=\"https://infogram.com\" style=\"color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infogram</a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it speaks to the important role that California community colleges play in meeting local education demand,&quot; said Erik Skinner, the community college system&rsquo;s deputy chancellor, about the pace of construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skinner said the system has also opened 70 smaller community college &quot;satellite centers,&quot; across the state during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nine of the system&rsquo;s full-scale community colleges have been built since 1985, again far more than the two Eastin claimed for this time period in her convention speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&quot;An error in good faith&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastin&rsquo;s spokesman Jon Murchinson acknowledged the inaccuracy of the community college statistic -- a figure that greatly throws off her &quot;six colleges&quot; to &quot;23 prisons&quot; comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told PolitiFact California it was &quot;an error in good faith as (Eastin) had heard the number from someone,&quot; and that she &quot;regrets using it without verifying the source.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said she won&rsquo;t be using it in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Eastin missed the mark, a look at campus data shows the California community college system has significantly slowed its pace of construction. It built a combined 32 campuses in the 1960s and 70s but only nine in the nearly four decades after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skinner, the system&rsquo;s deputy chancellor, said construction is driven by population growth and economic conditions, which fueled the campus boom in the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s. It has focused on adding to its existing colleges and on student completion rates in recent decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent Capital Public Radio interview, candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin claimed the state has built only six college campuses, including two community colleges, &quot;but 23 prisons&quot; since 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastin was right in her count of state prisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she was way off the mark on colleges: California has opened 41 community colleges, three California State University campuses and one University of California campus for a total of 45 campuses since 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastin made a similar claim at the California Democratic Convention in May, though she used a more recent timeline. She said California had built &quot;just six colleges but 22 prisons&quot; since 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That statement is also inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastin&rsquo;s campaign told us the candidate made a mistake and will correct her figures in future statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Eastin&rsquo;s claim from her radio interview&nbsp;False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>PolitiFact California intern Kathryn Palmer contributed research and writing for this article.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Governor&rsquo;s race</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/delaine-eastin/\">Delaine Eastin</a>&nbsp;is among several Democratic candidates&nbsp;competing to succeed Jerry Brown in the 2018 California governor&#39;s race.
