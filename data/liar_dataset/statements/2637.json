So it&rsquo;s not surprising that the probe has played a prominent role in campaign literature and TV ads of the candidates promising to deliver a more honest, open government to Cuyahoga County residents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the scandal also has become a useful weapon for those seeking state offices, including Republicans who want to see State Sen. and former Ohio House Speaker Jon Husted become the next Secretary of State.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Ohio Republican Party is distributing a piece of campaign literature for Husted that juxtaposes the now iconic photo of federal agents leading Dimora from his home in chains last month with an unflattering image of Husted&rsquo;s Democratic opponent, Maryellen O&rsquo;Shaughnessy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven without words, the ad is playing the guilt-by-association game. (Democrats mastered the game four years ago, tying every Republican they could to the now infamous coin dealer and Republican fund-raiser Tom Noe, who ended up behind bars for theft and corruption charges.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ORP literature claims O&rsquo;Shaughnessy &quot;accepted campaign cash from indicted politician Jimmy Dimora.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat charge could certainly resonate with voters, especially in Northeast Ohio, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to test its truthfulness.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDimora&rsquo;s campaign in fact did give money - $100 - to O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s campaign. And Dimora has been indicted on 23 federal charges.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever the two facts don&rsquo;t fit together as neatly in reality as they do on the flier.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Shaughnessy received the donation on June 25, 2008, a month before the federal investigation became public and agents raided Dimora&rsquo;s home and office. At the time, O&rsquo;Shaughnessy was not a candidate for secretary of state, but was running for her current job, Franklin County clerk of courts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy using the term &quot;indicted politician,&quot; the ad implies that O&rsquo;Shaughnessy accepted money from Dimora after he was indicted. Dimora, who maintains his innocence, wasn&rsquo;t indicted until September 2010. And it&#39;s worth noting again, the federal investigation was not public when the donation was made.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GOP flier restates the claim with more dramatic flare on the back. &quot;O&rsquo;Shaughnessy took campaign cash from corrupt politician Jimmy Dimora,&quot; a point illustrated by a close up of a thick stack of $100 bills passing between two hands.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHusted, though not directly responsible for distributing the advertisement, supports its messaging and believes the ad is fair description of the facts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ORP also stands by the claim argues that even after O&rsquo;Shaughnessy learned of the indictments, she never returned the money or donated an equal amount to charity as other Democrats in a similar predicament have done. (O&rsquo;Shaughnessy argues her campaign account is closed and therefore can&rsquo;t do anything. But that doesn&rsquo;t preclude her from donating an equal amount from her current campaign to charity.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurning back to the claim at hand, O&rsquo;Shaughnessy did accept a campaign contribution from Dimora. And Dimora has been indicted in a federal corruption probe. Separately those are correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the flier&rsquo;s combines the two facts to make the underlying suggestion that O&rsquo;Shaughnessy took the money from a politician under federal indicted at the time of the contribution. That underlying message qualifies the claim for a rating of False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/10/ohio_gop_flier_tries_to_tie_ma.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-20T14:10:41.929771", "ruling_date": "2010-10-20T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio Republican Party flier tries to tie Maryellen O'Shaughnessy to Cuyahoga County corruption scandal", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-republican-party-flier-tries-tie-maryellen-os", "ruling_link_text": "Donation predates indictment by more than 2 years", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Republican Party mailer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterviews, Jon Husted spokesman Ryan Frazee, Oct. 18, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterviews, Maryellen O&rsquo;Shaughnessy spokeswoman Heidi Hubmann, Oct.18, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFranklin County Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://vote.franklincountyohio.gov/assets/pdf/campaign-finance/2008/pre-general/2008-Pre-General-FC-Clerk-of-CP-Crt-Maryellen-OShaughnessy.PDF\" id=\"iu63\" title=\"candidate finance report for Maryellen O'Shaughnessy\">candidate finance report for Maryellen O&#39;Shaughnessy</a>, filed Oct. 23, 2008</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 769, "last_name": "Ohio Republican Party", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "ohio-republican-party", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Ohio_Republican_Party_elephant_icon.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/769/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.ohiogop.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Maryellen O&rsquo;Shaughnessy &quot;accepted campaign cash from indicted politician Jimmy Dimora.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign mailer", "statement_date": "2010-10-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 165, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/165/", "subject": "Negative Campaigning", "subject_slug": "campaign-advertising", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
