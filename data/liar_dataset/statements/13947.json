You have rural counties, ones that don&rsquo;t touch the ocean, struggling. Housing prices are up there, while jobs don&rsquo;t go there.&quot; </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Gov.

He said, however, that the region is outperforming the state in its share of middle-class jobs that pay between $45,000 and $60,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Central Valley</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Central Valley stretches about 450 miles from Bakersfield north to Redding. It includes urban cities like Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto and Fresno, vast farmland and a diverse economy, making job growth trends&nbsp;for the overall region more complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/groups/College%20of%20Business%20Administration/documents/2016_business-forecast-report_vol6-iss1.pdf\">report by Stanislaus State University</a> in the Central Valley city of Turlock offers some help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report shows the 8-county San Joaquin Valley, which makes up the central and southern portions of the Central Valley, experienced a 1.56 percent job growth rate in 2016; a 1.86 percent rate in 2015 and 1.80 percent in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those averages trailed the state&rsquo;s overall job growth average, which measured 3 percent in 2015 and about 2 percent last year. But it beat the 8-county region&rsquo;s 1.23 percent historical average job growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/8605114/Stan%20State%20chart%202.JPG\" style=\"height:701px; width:1207px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>SOURCE: Stanislaus State University, College of Business Administration, <a href=\"https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/groups/College%20of%20Business%20Administration/documents/2016_business-forecast-report_vol6-iss1.pdf\">2016 Business Forecast Report</a>,&nbsp;</em>Volume VI, Issue 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Within its own limits, the Valley has consistently grown.

Jerry Brown recently claimed California&rsquo;s Central Valley and Inland Empire &quot;are experiencing tremendous job growth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists say Brown is right about the Inland Empire.
