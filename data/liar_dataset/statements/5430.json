Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, recently complained about socially conservative bills being approved this winter by the Republican-controlled General Assembly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring a Feb. 10 interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC&rsquo;s PoliticsNation, Howell called the GOP majority &quot;a steamroller&quot; in passing legislation to ease gun control laws and strengthen voter identification requirements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What&rsquo;s really ironic with what&rsquo;s happening is it&rsquo;s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is to buy a gun with what they&rsquo;re doing on gun control issues,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it really becoming easier to buy a gun than cast a ballot in Virginia?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowell told us her statement was a &quot;rhetorical slur.&quot; She cited some of bills that have been approved by the General Assembly this year but did not offer a point-by-point comparison of the requirements to buy a gun or cast a vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we looked at Virginia&rsquo;s laws overseeing <a href=\"http://www.vsp.state.va.us/Firearms_PurchaseEligibility.shtm\">firearm purchases</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/cms/Voter_Information/Voter_Rights_Responsibilities.html\">voting.</a> You have to be at least 18 for either activity. You have to be a state resident to vote in Virginia. But you don&rsquo;t have to live in Virginia to buy a gun here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s examine the other requirements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Identification</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo register to vote, you must present a document that shows your name and address. It can be a valid photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo cast a ballot, you must show identification or sign a statement -- subject to felony conviction for false information -- that you are the registered voter you represent yourself to be. This requirement is being altered by the General Assembly this year, a point we&rsquo;ll address later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo buy a gun from a licensed dealer in Virginia, you must show primary and secondary forms of identification. The primary document must be a state-issued photo ID. The secondary identification just needs to contain your current address and can be a utility bill, voter registration card, bank check or hunting or fishing license.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in the case of private guns sales -- if you buy a firearm from an individual who is not a licensed dealer -- the identification requirements go away.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Application </strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo register to vote, you must fill out and submit an application 22 days before a general or primary election. The form can be submitted at variety of locations or by mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo buy a gun from a licensed dealer, you have to submit to a computerized background check run by the state police. It&rsquo;s usually completed in a matter of minutes, but can take as long as four days. The background check does not apply to private gun sales, and such transactions can occur instantly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Disqualification</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou can&rsquo;t vote if you are a felon and have not had your rights restored, or if you have been judged mentally incapacitated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany things could turn up on a background check that would bar someone from buying a gun from a licensed dealer. They include conviction or indictment on felony charges, an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor or felony, outstanding protective or restraining orders, use of illegal drugs, mental incompetency judgement, orders for mental health treatment, dishonorable discharge from military, and conviction on domestic violence charges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn private sales, it is a felony to knowingly sell a gun to a person who would be disqualified under the instant background check. But there is no onus on a private seller to inquire about a buyer&rsquo;s background, and no requirement that a purchaser disclose whether he or she is legally qualified to buy a firearm in Virginia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What could change</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs Howell noted in her interview with Sharpton, the General Assembly has passed several bills this year affecting voting and gun purchases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe major change in voting concerns what happens if voters don&rsquo;t have identification when they show up at the polls on Election Day. Instead of signing an affidavit and having their vote counted immediately, anyone who can&rsquo;t present ID would turn in a provisional ballot. Local electoral boards meet the day after the election to determine which of the votes are valid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut this provision does not necessarily make voting tougher than buying a gun. You would have no hope of buying a gun from a licensed dealer if you did not present identification. And you still won&rsquo;t need ID to buy a gun for a private dealer. So the comparison doesn&rsquo;t change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislators have also repealed a law limiting handgun purchases to one a month. Many exceptions have been put in the law since passed in 1993. But the repeal would not change the requirements for buying a gun in the first place, it will allow you to buy more each time you clear the hurdles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowell said it is becoming harder to vote in Virginia than buy a gun..<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are more restrictions on buying a gun from a licensed dealer than voting. The firearm purchase requires more identification. The gun buyer has to go through a background check that the voter does not. And you can be more easily disqualified from buying a gun than you can be from voting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there are fewer barriers to buying a gun privately than there are to voting. The private gun sale requires no wait, no identification, and no easily enforceable disqualifications.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Howell&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-25T20:33:05.405843", "ruling_date": "2012-02-27T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
