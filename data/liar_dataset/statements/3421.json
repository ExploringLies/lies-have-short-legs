The bulletin from Cato, <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/\">a libertarian think tank</a>, explicitly calls on states to ban collective bargaining in the public sector.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Collective bargaining is a misguided labor policy because it violates civil liberties and gives unions excessive power to block needed reforms,&quot; Chris Edwards, the institute&rsquo;s director of tax policy studies, wrote in the bulletin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat quote leaves no doubt about where Edwards is coming from.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s turn to some of his numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe presents 2009 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and concludes that &quot;unionized public sector workers have much higher average wages and benefits than non-unionized public sector workers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpecifically, Edwards wrote that union members have a 31 percent advantage in wages and a 68 percent advantage in benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn accompanying table of statistics combines the wage and benefits advantage into one number: total compensation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotal compensation is 42 percent higher for the union workers, Edwards concluded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same figure -- 42 percent -- is cited in the Crossroads ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCase closed?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot exactly. As Collegio, the spokesman for the group, notes, the ad pulls a hard number directly from the study. But there are some problems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, the ad says the system &quot;pays&quot; union workers a 42 percent premium. It makes no mention of benefits, even though the Cato report combines the two to get the 42 percent gap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat confuses the comparison right from the start.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat point -- &quot;pay&quot; vs. &quot;total compensation&quot; -- didn&rsquo;t bother Edwards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the use of the 42 percent number did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt troubles us, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEdwards says the number &nbsp;is taken out of context and the more accurate total compensation gap is lower, perhaps by a considerable amount.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s home in on part of the equation, wages. The study showed a 31 percent gap favoring union members by that measure. But that number, based on raw government data, has not been adjusted to make the comparison across states more valid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEdwards noted the study concludes that part of the union-nonunion gap stems from general labor market variations across states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;States with generally higher wages tend to be more unionized,&quot; the study says. &quot;Analyses that hold constant such cross-state differences find that public-sector unions increase average pay levels by roughly 10 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a far cry from 31 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the 31 percent was critical in arriving at the 42 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow far off is the 42 percent figure?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEdwards said it&rsquo;s impossible to say. While wages have been studied effectively, he said, studies on benefits are rare, partly because benefits vary so much from place to place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found another study by a libertarian think tank that supports Edwards&rsquo; contention that a much lower wage number is more accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://myfreedomfoundation.com/\">Freedom Foundation</a>, based in Washington state, published <a href=\"http://www.effwa.org/files/pdf/SWEEPINGTHESHOPFLOOR.pdf\">a study in </a><a href=\"http://www.effwa.org/files/pdf/SWEEPINGTHESHOPFLOOR.pdf\">2010</a> that put the gap at 11 percent to 12 percent for state and local government workers, union vs. non-union. Freedom Foundation, which supports Walker&rsquo;s union move in a petition drive on its website, compared comparable employees, and controlled for state effects, demographics, experience, education, marital status and occupation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers found an even smaller wage gap of about 5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEconomists Keith Bender and John Heywood collaborated on an April <a href=\"http://www.slge.org/vertical/Sites/%7BA260E1DF-5AEE-459D-84C4-876EFE1E4032%7D/uploads/%7B03E820E8-F0F9-472F-98E2-F0AE1166D116%7D.PDF\">2010 study </a><a href=\"http://www.slge.org/vertical/Sites/%7BA260E1DF-5AEE-459D-84C4-876EFE1E4032%7D/uploads/%7B03E820E8-F0F9-472F-98E2-F0AE1166D116%7D.PDF\">on</a> compensation. Bender, a public sector labor expert, told us that a large body of research has put the figure around 5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, whatever the true figure, it would substantially reduce the 42 percent used in the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s take a final look at a related point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEdwards also took issue with wording in the ad that might lead some viewers to think that the ad is comparing government workers to private employees -- not public union workers with public non-union workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s take a look back at the ad&rsquo;s language (italics added): &quot;a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWould some readers or listeners think Edwards is comparing public to private because the ad fails to modify that second &quot;workers&quot; with the prefix &quot;government?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe suppose they could -- and <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2011/03/right-leaning_think_tank_says.html\">critics have </a><a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2011/03/right-leaning_think_tank_says.html\">said</a> it could be a tactic to pit private workers against government workers. But the entire context of the ad is public sector.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrossroads GPS, a conservative group seeking to illustrate the cost of public sector unions says unionized government workers are paid 42 percent more than non-union workers. The study it cites for backup does contain that figure, but the number is misleading because it is not adjusted for important differences between states. Even the author of the study makes this point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is a gap of some size. So, the ad contains an element of truth in highlighting a pay gap, but uses an inflated number.
