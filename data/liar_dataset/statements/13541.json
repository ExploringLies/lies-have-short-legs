The group of global human rights experts concluded from their research that past transgressions had led to current strife in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent,&quot; the report read. &quot;Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The panel said progress had been made in America over the decades, but the nation was facing a &quot;human rights crisis&quot; brought on by the lingering racial discord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;reparatory justice&quot; suggested by the panel includes considering benefits similar to those sought by a <a href=\"http://www.caricom.org/reparations-for-native-genocide-and-slavery\">Caribbean coalition</a> seeking reparations from European countries that colonized them. Those reparations encompass the possibilities of &quot;a formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities, an African knowledge programme, psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s first acknowledge that Obama doesn&rsquo;t lead the United Nations, though the United States certainly holds sway over U.N. actions. The United States is a charter member of the group, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a significant financial contributor. But the body is led by South Korean Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who will be succeeded by Portuguese leader Antonio Guterres on <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2016/12/12/Antonio-Guterres-sworn-in-as-ninth-UN-secretary-general/5961481589906/\">Jan. 1, 2017</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Obama has publicly said that he <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/26/bernie-s/reparations-for-slavery-sanders-obama-clinton/\">does not support the idea of financial reparations</a> for slavery. He has said he&rsquo;d prefer to focus on expanding access to jobs, health care, education and other programs to address the disadvantages minorities face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the panel&rsquo;s findings are nonbinding. The United Nations isn&rsquo;t forcing the United States to do anything. The report was an academic exercise to explore the legacy of slavery on modern America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing official about the report beyond its U.N.-sanctioned research. There certainly isn&rsquo;t any plan for the federal government to pay such reparations, immediately or otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website Freedom Daily said in a headline that the &quot;Obama-Led U.N. has just made it official, U.S. to immediately pay blacks &lsquo;reparations&rsquo;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The posts track back to a U.N.-affiliated panel that concluded America&rsquo;s history of slavery has stacked the deck against modern African-Americans. The group found that reparations to those citizens are justifiable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every part of the eye-grabbing headline is wrong: Obama doesn&rsquo;t lead the United Nations, the report is non-binding and has no official impact on the federal government, and there are no plans for the U.S. to immediately pay reparations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the only thing accurate thing in the posts are that such a study even exists, but it&rsquo;s presented in such a misleading way that it&rsquo;s beyond just inaccurate.
