George Allen recently ripped Democrats for growing government and exploding the national debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Election Day 2010 saw the culmination of years of aggravation and resentment toward a federal government that became disconnected and disdainful of the values and priorities of Americans,&quot; Allen wrote in a Nov. 5 Op/Ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. &quot;People are rightfully riled by bailouts of failed automobile manufacturers, health care dictates, energy restrictions, and the unprecedented expansion of government spending and dangerous debt -- nearly $6 trillion more than when President Obama was sworn into office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhoa. Did he say $6 trillion more in debt? Since January 2009? That&rsquo;s a statistic we hadn&rsquo;t heard before. So we decided to look into it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the U.S. Treasury, the total national debt as of Jan. 31, 2009 -- 11 days after President Obama took office -- was $10.6 trillion. So, in order for Allen&rsquo;s claim to be true on its face, the current publicly held debt would have to be about $16.6 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, is it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNope, not even close. The publicly held debt as of Oct. 31 was $13.7 trillion, almost $3 trillion short of Allen&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked for a source, Tim Nussbaum, Allen&rsquo;s executive assistant, cited an Oct. 18 CBS News report on the nation&rsquo;s rising debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat report also finds that the debt has risen by almost $3 trillion, but adds: &quot;The administration has projected the national debt will soar in Mr. Obama&#39;s fourth year in office to nearly $16.5-trillion in 2012. That&#39;s more than 100 percent of the value of the nation&#39;s economy and $5.9-trillion above what it was his first day on the job.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo check that, we turned to the Office of Management and Budget to to look at future debt estimates based on the current fiscal 2011 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf $16.335 trillion qualifies as &quot;nearly $16.5 trillion,&quot; then the CBS report is right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is Allen? Let&rsquo;s take a look back to decide. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen&rsquo;s language in the Op/Ed plainly implies the Obama administration&#39;s actions have already caused the debt to rise $6 trillion. That&rsquo;s simply wrong. The debt has risen by $3.1 trillion since Obama took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that reason, we find Allen&rsquo;s claim to be False.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-09T13:03:49.662233", "ruling_date": "2010-11-09T12:47:55", "ruling_headline": "George Allen says national debt increased $6 trillion under Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "george-allen-says-national-debt-increased-6-trilli", "ruling_link_text": "Debt hasn't grown that fast", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Richmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;<a href=\"http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/nov/05/ed-allen05-ar-632464/\">Keep Promises to &lsquo;We the People&rsquo;&quot;</a>, Nov. 5, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2010/opds102010.pdf\">October 2010 monthly statement of the public debt</a>, accessed Nov. 6, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2009/opds012009.pdf\">January 2009 monthly statement of the public debt</a>, accessed Nov. 6, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOffice of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/hist07z1.xls\">Federal Debt at the End of the Year, 1940&ndash;2015</a>&quot; (Historical table 7.1), accessed Oct. 22, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOffice of Management and Budget, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/11msr.pdf\">Fiscal Year 2011 Mid-Session Review</a>, accessed Nov. 8, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20019931-503544.html\">National Debt up $3 Trillion on Obama&rsquo;s Watch&quot;</a>, Oct. 18, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Nov. 8, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Tim Nussbaum, executive assistant to George Allen.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "consultant", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "George", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 831, "last_name": "Allen", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "george-allen", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/George__Allen.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/831/", "total_count": 27, "true_count": 8, "website": "http://www.georgeallen.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe debt is &quot;nearly $6 trillion more than when President Obama was sworn into office.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a newspaper Op/Ed", "statement_date": "2010-11-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
