Meanwhile, the end of the war could have been the the British surrender at Yorktown (Oct. 17, 1781), the signing of the Treaty of Paris (September 1783), the ratification of the treaty by the Continental Congress (Jan. 14, 1784), the ratification by King George III of England (April 9, 1784) or the exchange of the ratification documents (May 12, 1784).<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2395\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2396\" />\r\n\tRichard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina, told us that how one conceptualizes a war further complicates the answer. &quot;Afghanistan could be considered simply a campaign of the &#39;war on terror&#39; if one accepts that as a war, just as Korea and Vietnam could be considered campaigns of the Cold War rather than separate wars.&quot;<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2740\" />\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"2743\">\r\n\tWe decided not to count the 46-year-long Cold War on the grounds that it belongs in a separate category. We also did not count situations in which U.S. military forces have remained in a long-term role long after the shooting has stopped, such as the U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea for the last 55 years. Finally, we ignored battles that are popularly called &quot;wars&quot; but are usually not fought on military terms, such as the &quot;war on drugs.&quot;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"3203\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"3206\">\r\n\tSo, in terms of duration, the Vietnam War was tops -- until now.</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"3273\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"3276\">\r\n\tAmerican involvement in Vietnam spans decades.

Kennedy expanded that presence.</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"3507\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"3510\">\r\n\tBut the formal beginning of U.S. involvement often is dated from Congress&#39; passage of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution on Aug. 7, 1964. It gave President Lyndon Johnson authority to send troops into battle.
