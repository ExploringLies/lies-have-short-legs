Donald Trump doesn&rsquo;t care about some families. He&rsquo;s against marriage equality. He wants to go back.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has been criticized for flip-flopping on social issues. Is Maloney right about the Republican candidate&rsquo;s stance on same-sex marriage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump through the years</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest reference from Trump on the issue that we could track down is an interview in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+%22gay+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-RWWTeCDEuLeiAKun8WdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ%20-%20v=onepage&amp;q=%22Donald%20Trump%22%20AND%20%22gay%20rights%22&amp;f=falselonghttp://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+%22gay+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-RWWTeCDEuLeiAKun8WdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Donald%20Trump%22%20AND%20%22gay%20rights%22&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Advocate in 2000</u></a>. At the time Trump was rumored to be considering a run for president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,&quot; Trump said during the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said he would favor a domestic partnership law that afforded same-sex couples the same benefits as married couples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast-forward to 2011 when Trump was again considering a run for the White House. He sat down for <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2011/03/30/donald-trump-sits-down-bill-oreilly/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an interview with Bill O&rsquo;Reilly</u></a> on Fox News and talked about his position on same-sex marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I just don&#39;t feel good about it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I don&#39;t feel right about it. I&#39;m against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it&#39;s like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I&#39;m opposed to gay marriage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, last year Trump <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/06/28/donald-trump-on-cnns-state-of-the-union-im-in-it-to-win-it-i-will-make-our-country-great-again/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said in an interview</u></a> on CNN that he supported &lsquo;traditional marriage.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;He wants to go back&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maloney&rsquo;s claim was made in the context of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2015 decision on same-sex marriage. Trump does not agree with the decision.
