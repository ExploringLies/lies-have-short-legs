Rick Perry&rsquo;s pitch for California businesses to check out opportunities in his state, the <em>Sacramento Bee</em> editorial board <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/06/5168690/pity-rick-perry-his-big-state.html\">said</a> Texas ranks poorly in several ways.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve been sorting through the Feb. 6, 2013, editorial&rsquo;s factual claims. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/\">Click here</a> to read our collected checks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the claims: &quot;Come check out a state that is last in mental health expenditures...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s familiar. We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/jan/10/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-dead-last-mental-health-spe/\">recently looked into</a> the same characterization by state Sen. Wendy Davis, rating it Mostly True. Another state lagged Texas in the latest national ranking of states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee&rsquo;s editorial page, pointed us to the same source that Davis cited, a Dec. 18, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/news/health/Mental-Health-Funding-in-Texas-183851011.html\">news story</a> posted by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, that was headlined &quot;Texas ranks last in mental health funding.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat story said Texas ranked last in the country in per-person mental health spending based on dollar amounts it attributed to the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities. When we inquired, a center official told us they gave WFAA information about spending in fiscal 2009 as written up in an August 2012 <a href=\"http://www.caction.org/CAN-Research/Reports/2012/Martinez_MentalHealthDisparities.pdf\">report</a> by the Texas-based<a href=\"http://www.hogg.utexas.edu/\"> Hogg Foundation for Mental Health</a>. The Hogg Foundation, in turn, said its source was a listing of per-person mental health care spending data in 50 states by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser foundation charts for those years, though the<a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparemaptable.jsp?yr=30&amp;typ=4&amp;ind=278&amp;cat=5&amp;sub=149\"> 2007 chart</a> shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation <a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparemaptable.jsp?ind=277&amp;cat=5\">chart</a>. Its <a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparemaptable.jsp?ind=278&amp;cat=5\">per-person spending</a> of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalifornia was 14th among the states, at $152.60 in such spending per person.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe editorial says Texas is last in mental health spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, the latest year analyzed, Texas spent more in raw dollars on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after ranking last to all other states for several years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim as Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-08T18:45:13.562609", "ruling_date": "2013-02-08T17:40:43", "ruling_headline": "Sacramento Bee editorial says Texas is last in mental health care spending", "ruling_headline_slug": "sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-last-mental-he", "ruling_link_text": "But for Idaho", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTruth-O-Meter article, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/jan/10/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-dead-last-mental-health-spe/\">&quot;Wendy Davis says Texas &lsquo;dead last&rsquo; in mental health spending,&quot;</a> PolitiFact Texas, Jan. 10, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Craig Palosky, director of communications, Kaiser Family Foundation, Feb. 8, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Ted Lutterman, director of research analysis, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, Feb. 8, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2172, "last_name": "Sacramento Bee Editorial Board", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "sacramento-bee-editorial-board", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/sacbeeimage0213pft_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2172/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.sacbee.com/editorials/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Texas is &quot;last in mental health expenditures.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an editorial", "statement_date": "2013-02-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
