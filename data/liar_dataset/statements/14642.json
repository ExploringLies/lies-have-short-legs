And he continues to struggle to get it right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://youtu.be/F79xhiHftyg\">an interview</a>, Mike Sacks, national political correspondent for E.W. Scripps, brought this up with Trump. Here&rsquo;s that exchange:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sacks: </strong>&quot;You&#39;ve repeatedly said that we&#39;re the highest taxed nation in the world when that&#39;s been seen as objectively false. With the credibility you need to pass tax reform, why --&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong> &quot;Some people say it differently, they say we&#39;re the highest developed nation taxed in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sacks:</strong> &quot;Then why don&#39;t you say it that way?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong> &quot;Because a lot of people know exactly what i&#39;m talking about, and in many cases they think I&rsquo;m right when I say the highest. As far as I&#39;m concerned I think we&#39;re really essentially the highest, but if you want to add the &lsquo;developed nation,&rsquo; you can say that, too. But a lot of people agree that the way I&#39;m saying it is exactly correct.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does adding the &quot;developed nation&quot; label make the claim more accurate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Trump has said before that America has the highest corporate tax rate, he&rsquo;s on pretty firm ground and we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/15/donald-trump/pledging-cuts-donald-trump-says-wisconsin-rally-us/\">rated him Mostly True</a>. The statutory tax rate for corporations is 35 percent, the highest among countries like Japan, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other European nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to be clear, the tax rate on paper and the effective tax rate are two different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the thousands of deductions and exemptions in state and federal tax codes, according to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report, the <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675844.pdf\">effective average corporate tax is 22 percent</a>. That puts the country in the middle of the pack among our economic peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the tax burden across the board for individuals and companies alike, economists generally rely on a couple of yardsticks. One is the total tax burden compared to the size of the economy and the other is the tax burden per person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent numbers come from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for 2015. The countries it compares include the group that are generally seen as &quot;developed nations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a <a href=\"http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=78518\">percentage of GDP</a>, the U.S. tax burden -- covering all levels of government -- ranks 28th out of 32 countries. We ran the numbers based on federal revenues alone, and the rankings stayed about the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV\">per-person</a> basis, America ranks 13th out of 31 nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the White House if they had other numbers. We didn&rsquo;t hear back, but if we do, we&rsquo;ll update this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that the United States is &quot;the highest developed nation taxed in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at tax collections relative to the size of the U.S. economy and the number of people, the numbers tell a different story. The United States ranks 28th in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP and 13th on a per-capita basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said his view is &quot;exactly correct.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, it is exactly incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-10-17T15:47:09.268155", "ruling_date": "2017-10-18T16:42:50", "ruling_headline": "Once again, Trump overstates U.S. tax ranking", "ruling_headline_slug": "once-again-trump-overstates-us-tax-ranking", "ruling_link_text": "A mental block?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Scripps Television, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/mrvwbh9qo11bypf/WEB%20PKG%20TRUMP%20TAXES%20TRUTH%20101817.mp4?dl=0\">Interview with Donald Trump</a>, Oct. 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675844.pdf\">&quot;Most Large Profitable U.S. Corporations Paid Tax but Effective Tax Rates Differed Significantly from the Statutory Rate,&quot;</a> March 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, <a href=\"http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=78518\">Total tax revenue as pecentage of GDP</a>, accessed Oct. 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/\">&quot;For the third time, Donald Trump, U.S. is not &#39;highest taxed nation in the world,&rsquo;&quot;</a> May 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/15/donald-trump/pledging-cuts-donald-trump-says-wisconsin-rally-us/\">Pledging cuts, Donald Trump says at Wisconsin rally that U.S. has highest corporate tax rate</a>, Dec. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We&#39;re the highest developed nation taxed in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview with E.W.
