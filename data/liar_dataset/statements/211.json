On the dates of those meetings, he was paid for lucrative speaking appearances elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n On April 11-12, 2006, the first official meeting of the Iraq Study Group was held in Washington, D.C. Where was Giuliani? On April 12, he was a keynote speaker at the FT Asian Financial Centers Summit in South Korea. His net fee: $160,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second official meeting of the group was May 18-19, 2006. Where was Giuliani? On May 18, he spoke at the Georgia 100 annual awards breakfast in Atlanta. His net fee: $80,000. Later that day, he attended a $100-a-plate fundraiser for former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed, then a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia.\n</p>\n<p>\n James Baker, secretary of state under the first President Bush, was co-chair of the Iraq Study Group, along with former U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. Baker declined to comment for this story.\n</p>\n<p>\n But his co-chair explains how Giuliani left the group.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hamilton says that after Giuliani told Baker he couldn't attend the second meeting in a row, \"(Baker) said, 'I'm going to have to go to another person.' \"\n</p>\n<p>\n On May 31, 2006, the group announced former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III would replace Giuliani.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the time, Giuliani said: \"My previous time commitments do not permit me the full and active participation that the Iraq Study Group deserves.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n It's unclear whether he was fired or forced to quit, but consider this: During his two-month tenure on the panel, between March 15, 2006, and May 24, 2006, Giuliani made 30 paid appearances for a net revenue of $2.25-million, according to his financial disclosure forms.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pretty simple to us; McCain's attack is True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:30.520240", "ruling_date": "2007-12-04T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "This attack is spot-on", "ruling_headline_slug": "this-attack-is-spot-on", "ruling_link_text": "This attack is spot-on", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Public financial disclosure report,\n<a href=\"http://www.cq.com/graphics/moneyline/pfd/p07pfd/00000/00000014.pdf\">\n \"Rudolph W.
