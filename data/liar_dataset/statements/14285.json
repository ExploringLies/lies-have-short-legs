The page&rsquo;s source code said it was published on June 22, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;10:30 pm last night police received a call about gun fire in Miami Gardens. Manager killed 10 employees because they was stealing money and tons of supplies,&quot; it read. It was illustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34440-d4278082-Reviews-Checker_s-Miami_Gardens_Florida.html\">photo of a Checkers restaurant</a> at 2645 NW 183rd St in Miami Gardens, Fla., between Miami and Fort Lauderdale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to fight fake news. As of this writing, the post was shared almost 2,700 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post is fake, because every post from Channel24News.com is fake. It&rsquo;s a website designed to allow users to create their own stories, whether they are real or not (presumably not).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should be able to note that right away, thanks to the Yao Ming meme cartoon at the page header, accompanied by the words, &quot;You Got Owned!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A note on the righthand side of the website reads, &quot;You&#39;ve Been Pranked! Now Create A Story &amp; Trick Your Friends!&quot; Clicking on the button allows a user to write a headline and body text, and upload a photograph to illustrate it. The site generates a url that people can then send to people in an effort to convince them it&rsquo;s real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site nominally advises people to be smart about what they create, noting in its footer, &quot;We do NOT support FAKE NEWS!!! This is a Prank website that is intended for Fun. Bullying, Violent Threats or posts that Violate Public Order are NOT permitted on this Website.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, a &quot;prank&quot; about a shooting at a fast food restaurant is a bit on the violent side, but as of this writing the Checkers story had not been removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site is registered to a <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/channel24news.com\">Korry Scherer in Milwaukee, Wis</a>.
