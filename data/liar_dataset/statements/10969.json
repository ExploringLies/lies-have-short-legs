Jeb Bush said in a <a href=\"http://time.com/3921956/jeb-bush-campaign-launch-transcript/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">speech</a> launching his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The party now in the White House is planning a no-suspense primary, for a no-change election,&quot; he said in his June 15 remarks in Miami. &quot;They are responsible for the slowest economic recovery ever, the biggest debt increases ever, a massive tax increase on the middle class, the relentless buildup of the regulatory state, and the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim that President Barack Obama and the Democrats have significantly raised taxes is bound to come up frequently in the 2016 election, so we decided to take a whack at it now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Bush&rsquo;s campaign specifically what tax increases he was talking about, they pointed to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a claim we heard before, and one that is flawed. Bush is correct that&nbsp;the Affordable Care Act raises taxes. But pinpointing the middle class as the recipient of &quot;a massive tax increase&quot; is misleading.&nbsp;It&#39;s the upper-class that is feeling the brunt of the impact. And health care subsidies, in some&nbsp;cases, may be offsetting tax increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A note: The term &quot;middle class&quot; is hard to define, but for the purposes of this article, we are roughly looking at a generous threshold that comprises&nbsp;households making up to&nbsp;$250,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Health care taxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s get the big number out of the way. The health care law is&nbsp;expected bring in more than<b>&nbsp;</b>$1 trillion in new taxes&nbsp;over 10 years, according to a 2013 Joint Committee on Taxation <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4511\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\">report</a>.&nbsp;The revenue is coming in through&nbsp;<a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/supreme-courts-health-law-decision-leaves-in-place-21-tax-hikes-costing-taxpayers-more-than-675-billion/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\">21 new or increased&nbsp;taxes</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those 21,&nbsp;12 could affect households making less than $250,000 a year, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/blog/obamacare-tax-increases-will-impact-us-all\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\">Tax Foundation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve looked at this <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/02/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-dozen-obamacare-taxes-hit-middle-cl/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\">list of 12 before</a>. Some primarily target&nbsp;the middle class, others could hit certain people within the middle class, and others are debatable. Bush&rsquo;s campaign specifically sent us a list of the conservative <a href=\"https://www.atr.org/obamacare%E2%80%99s-top-five-middle-class-tax-hikes\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\">Americans for Tax Reform&rsquo;s &quot;top-five&quot; Obamacare middle class tax increases</a>. The five Bush cited are all included in our larger list of 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of the taxes are obvious, direct taxes on individuals -- such as a tax on indoor tanning services and the penalty for not complying with the individual mandate to have insurance. These only apply to select individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many more are applied to companies, such as the excise tax on certain medical device manufacturers or the so-called &quot;Cadillac tax&quot; on high-cost health insurance plans. Many economists anticipate that companies will pass these taxes along to consumers in the form of higher premiums or more expensive products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, none of these taxes affects every single member of the middle class. It&rsquo;s possible there are individuals who will incur most of these additional costs, while others face a couple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether or not these taxes are -- as Bush put it -- &quot;massive&quot; increases on the middle class depends on individual circumstances, said Kyle Pomerleau, a Tax Foundation economist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would say that the tax increase in total was large and that some of it definitely hits the middle class in some way,&quot; he said. &quot;The degree to which individuals are impacted depends on their situation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some perspective, total federal revenues are <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/45653-OutlookUpdate_2014_Aug.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">estimated</a> to be about $40 trillion over 10 years. Tax revenue from the health care law, about $1 trillion, accounts for about 2.5 percent. Looking at the revenue just from the 12 that might affect middle-class taxpayers (as well as those in other income brackets), it&rsquo;s about 1.25 percent of overall tax revenue. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Almost certainly, yes, taxes have gone up for lower- and middle-income people,&quot; said Roberton Williams, a fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. &quot;But have they gone up a lot? Probably not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If I were pulling words out of the air, &lsquo;massive&rsquo; is not the word I would pull,&quot; Williams said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of these taxes tend to affect more people at the upper-end of middle class, because people with lower incomes are less likely to opt for the taxed services -- such as optional medical procedures or flexible savings accounts, Williams said</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversesly, some middle-income households might even see tax benefits of the Affordable Care Act -- namely, insurance premium subsidies -- outweigh any tax increases, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>P</strong>remium tax credits will save taxpayers<strong>&nbsp;</strong>about $19 billion in 2015, while the five taxes cited by Bush and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the <a href=\"https://www.atr.org/obamacare%E2%80%99s-top-five-middle-class-tax-hikes\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Americans for Tax Reform list</a> are worth much less, said Laurel Lucia, health care program manager at University of California Berkeley&rsquo;s Center for Labor Research and Education. In total, those five taxes are worth about $11 billion per year, she said, citing congressional research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I certainly agree Obamacare has increased taxes on the middle class,&quot; said University of California Los Angeles law professor Eric Zold. &quot;But it is not clear that the middle class as a group are not better off by the combination of Obamacare costs and benefits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other tax policies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s worth noting, of course, that the health care law&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/515/no-family-making-less-250000-will-see-any-form-tax/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">isn&rsquo;t the only policy</a> that has impacted taxes in the last few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some changes have&nbsp;had a positive impact on the wallets of the middle class. Some changes have had a negative impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after taking office, Obama signed a bill raising the sales tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products to support the State Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program. Less than 20 percent of the population smokes, though <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/105550/among-americans-smoking-decreases-income-increases.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">polling shows</a> that the percentage of the population that smokes decreases as income increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-hes-cut-taxes-middle-class-famil/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">tax cuts</a>, Obama&nbsp;extended the Bush-era tax cuts for people making below $250,000, as well as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-credit-least-16-tax-cuts-small/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">an array</a> of beneficial measures for small businesses. Additionally, he signed off on several stimulus tax measures to assist with the 2008 economic recovery -- such as a temporarily reduced payroll tax and an increased earned income tax credit. Some are still around, but others have phased out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s fair to say that under Obama, for the most part, taxes have decreased for lower-income people and increased for upper-income people, Williams said.<strong> </strong>And it&#39;s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a mixed bag for the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said, &quot;The party in the White House&quot; is responsible for &quot;a massive tax increase on the middle class.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush pointed to the Affordable Care Act, which certainly does involve tax increases -- some of which affect the middle class, though not exclusively. It&rsquo;s not accurate to call the tax increases for the middle class&nbsp;&quot;massive.&quot; Some individuals might see their tax bill go up, while others see the tax benefits of the health care law<strong>&nbsp;</strong>outweigh the costs, and some might experience a change so small they don&rsquo;t notice it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking only at the health care law also ignores other pieces of tax policy that have affected the bottom line for the middle class.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-18T19:03:50.562464", "ruling_date": "2015-06-23T16:36:54", "ruling_headline": "Jeb Bush: Obama caused 'massive' tax increase on middle class ", "ruling_headline_slug": "jeb-bush-obama-caused-massive-tax-increase-middle-", "ruling_link_text": "More like 'upper class'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Bush campaign launch <a href=\"http://time.com/3921956/jeb-bush-campaign-launch-transcript/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">transcript</a>, June 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Tax Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/blog/obamacare-tax-increases-will-impact-us-all\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Obamacare Tax Increases Will Impact Us All</a>,&quot;
