It&#39;s that people will choose not to buy something they don&#39;t like or want.&quot; (We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/28/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrong-most-22-million-uninsured-would-be/\">Mostly False</a>, because many of those people will not voluntarily lose coverage.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox&rsquo;s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That&rsquo;s where the story turned to fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that&rsquo;s all there is to it,&quot; Ryan is quoted. &quot;So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they&rsquo;re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it&rsquo;s their own problem if they can&rsquo;t afford to be healthy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan didn&rsquo;t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan&rsquo;s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which <a href=\"http://politicot.com/about-us/\">refers to itself in a disclaimer</a> as &quot;the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.&quot; The Politicot.com site is registered to an <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/politicot.com\">administrator named Eli Sompo</a>, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it isn&rsquo;t always obvious that&rsquo;s the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true &mdash; especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them <a href=\"http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/paul-ryan-22-million-americans-choose-poor-problem-cant-afford-healthy/\">without any warning at all</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan did discuss how the Senate&rsquo;s proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-11T11:29:42.697482", "ruling_date": "2017-07-11T11:33:09", "ruling_headline": "Fake news story twists Paul Ryan\u2019s words on poor people\u2019s health care coverage", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-news-story-twists-paul-ryans-words-poor-peopl", "ruling_link_text": "From a website that hides facts too well", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Politicot.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://politicot.com/paul-ryan-22-million-americans-choose-poor-problem-cant-afford-healthy/\">Paul Ryan: &lsquo;22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So It&rsquo;s Their Own Problem If They Can&rsquo;t Afford To Be Healthy&rsquo;</a>,&quot; June 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/52849-hr1628senate.pdf\">Cost estimate: Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017</a>,&quot; June 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/86iNDIVDCWY\">Paul Ryan: 22 million Americans won&rsquo;t be &lsquo;pushed off&rsquo; insurance &mdash; they will &lsquo;choose&rsquo; not to buy it</a>,&quot; June 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/28/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrong-most-22-million-uninsured-would-be/\">Paul Ryan wrong that most of the 22 million uninsured would be uninsured by choice</a>,&quot; June 28th, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/paul-ryan-22-million-americans-choose-poor-problem-cant-afford-healthy/\">Paul Ryan: &lsquo;22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So It&rsquo;s Their Own Problem If They Can&rsquo;t Afford To Be Healthy&rsquo;</a>,&quot; July 7, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3995, "last_name": "Newslo.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "newslocom", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/newslo.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3995/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://Newslo.com"}, "statement": "<p>Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans &quot;choose to be poor, so it&rsquo;s their own problem if they can&rsquo;t afford to be healthy.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an Internet post", "statement_date": "2017-06-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
