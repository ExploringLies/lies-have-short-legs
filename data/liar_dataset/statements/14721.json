(AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles &quot;but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing only one round with each pull of the trigger,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.nssf.org/msr/\">according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/state-law/Texas/\">Texas</a> <a href=\"http://lawcenter.giffords.org/background-checks-in-texas/\">does not have a state law</a> requiring any seller to run a background check on purchasers of any gun, said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is <a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/nics-background-check-required-transfer-long-guns-well-handguns\">federal law</a> requiring background checks in some cases, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers to run background checks before selling firearms of any kind to an unlicensed buyer,&quot; Freilich said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, unlicensed, private sellers are <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/explainer/article/gun-laws-regulations-firearms-8381025.php\">not required</a> by federal law to run background checks on individuals purchasing firearms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Twitter users pointed out this distinction to Milano. Appearing to have noticed the challenges to her claim, Milano <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alyssa_Milano/status/927372157432328193\">tweeted</a> less than two hours later: &quot;Background checks aren&rsquo;t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns.

That includes long guns. But private, unlicensed sellers are not required to conduct background checks under federal or Texas&nbsp;law, even though other states have added requirements to that effect.
