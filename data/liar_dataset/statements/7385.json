Marco Rubio&rsquo;s response to the State of the Union on Tuesday that is riling up the blogosphere. Where does Marco Rubio live?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPresident Barack Obama loves to say people who don&rsquo;t agree with him are rich, Rubio said on Feb. 12, 2013. Rubio went on to emphasize his own middle-class Republican cred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren&rsquo;t millionaires. They&rsquo;re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare. They&rsquo;re workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills. They&rsquo;re immigrants, who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome bloggers jabbed Rubio for omitting details about his West Miami crib.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe headline of a post from Miami gossip columnist Jose Lambiet: &quot;<a href=\"http://gossipextra.com/2013/02/13/marco-rubio-house-neighbors-miami-photos-2291/\">Marco Rubio: I still live in da hood -- sorta</a>!&quot; Lambiet included a <a href=\"http://gossipextra.mycapture.com/mycapture/enlarge.asp?image=45773953&amp;event=1344206&amp;CategoryID=70552&amp;Slideshow=Stop#Image\">slew of photos</a>&nbsp;of Rubio&rsquo;s home on his blog, including his living room, kitchen, and backyard pool, trampoline, wooden fort and patio surrounded by a tall green hedge. <em><a href=\"http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2013/02/marco_rubio_who_bragged_about.php\">Miami New Times</a></em>&nbsp;dinged Rubio for his &quot;humbleboast.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat&rsquo;s their beef?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne, Rubio did not mention his home is for sale. Rubio wants to sell the four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home and buy one in D.C. so he can see his kids more often, spokesman Alex Conant told <em><a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2013/01/30/rubio-selling-miami-home-moving-family-to-dc/\">The Daily Caller</a></em>&nbsp;in January. Rubio rents a room in a Capitol Hill apartment, Conant said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If he can sell his home in Miami, he would be able to afford to move his wife and kids to Washington during the school year and still own a home in Florida,&quot; Conant told us in an email.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd two, at a listing price of $675,000, the two-story, 2,700-square-foot home on a cul de sac is not what some may consider &quot;working class.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom New Times: <em>West Miami is, in fact, a fairly blue collar town, just west of tonier Coral Gables. But it&#39;s pretty brazen to put your residence there in a nationally televised speech when 1) you are actively trying to leave that working-class neighborhood and 2) you stand to make more than a half-million bucks by doing so.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRubio and wife Jeanette bought the home in 2005 for $550,000, the same year it was built. The sale garnered controversy for Rubio in 2008 when the <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2008/03/rubios-mortgage.html\"><em>Miami Herald</em> reported Rubio failed to disclose</a>&nbsp;a $135,000 equity line he obtained from a bank run by political supporters after taking out his mortgage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRubio&rsquo;s realtor and brother-in-law, Orlando Cicilia of Centrust Realty, told us Rubio&rsquo;s home is one of the nicer ones in his neighborhood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It&rsquo;s all a working-class neighborhood,&quot; he said. &quot;You&rsquo;ve got some executives, and you have a lot of regular people there.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCicilia said he found the home for Rubio at a construction price in 2005. Cicilia, married to Rubio&rsquo;s older sister, lives in Rubio&rsquo;s childhood home, about half a mile away. Cicilia did not want to elaborate on that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe neighborhood is in a central location close to pricier Coral Gables, the airport, shopping malls and other businesses. About 27,000 people live in Rubio&#39;s zip code (33144), according to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2007-11 American Community Survey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf those, 74 percent of the people are Cuban, and about 71 percent are foreign-born, according to Census data. The average years of education is 12, a high school diploma.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe median household income is $37,556. Less than 1 percent of households there make more than $200,000 a year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd while Rubio&rsquo;s home is going for $675,000, the median home value of an owner-occupied home is significantly lower at $311,475, according to 2010 Census data. Zillow.com put the median home list value in West Miami at $202,600.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRubio said he still lives in the &quot;same working-class neighborhood&quot; he grew up in. Yes, but he is looking to leave.
