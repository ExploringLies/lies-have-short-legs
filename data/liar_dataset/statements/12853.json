with an exception if it&rsquo;s necessary to save the life of the mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the questionnaire, Tarkanian told a reporter in March 2016 that he would &quot;<a href=\"http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/web-extra-danny-tarkanian\">absolutely</a>&quot; support defunding the reproductive health care provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why do we have to give $800 million to an entity that is providing such a divisive service as abortions and then coming out and seeing how they&rsquo;re selling body parts and all those other things?&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(PolitiFact <a href=\"http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/feb/08/john-obannon/del-john-obannon-says-planned-parenthood-sold-feta/\">rated a similar claim</a> that Planned Parenthood sold aborted fetus body parts for profit as False, and the group has been cleared of any wrongdoing in many states, including <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/2/nevada-ag-closes-inquiry-into-planned-parenthood/\">Nevada</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tarkanian has been been less direct on abortions for rape and incest victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closest he&rsquo;s come to addressing the issue was during a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wJ3zyg27Msc?t=10m19s\">June 2016 radio interview</a>, where he reiterated his opposition to abortion with the only exception being if continuing the pregnancy would threaten the life of the mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s the only time I think there should be the ability to terminate the life of an unborn,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his 2012 campaign for a different congressional seat, Tarkanian was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MctcInfJ91o\">target of an ad</a> that strongly implied he supported tea party Republicans who wanted to &quot;criminalize a woman&rsquo;s right to choose even in cases of rape or incest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tarkanian&rsquo;s campaign manager, James Fisfis, said the campaign didn&rsquo;t disagree with the claims but emphasized the Republican isn&rsquo;t pushing for any specific abortion-related legislation and would continue supporting full funding for women&rsquo;s health programs through groups other than Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tarkanian hasn&rsquo;t avoided using abortion as an issue in earlier campaigns &mdash; he ran <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/elections/tarkanian-goes-attack-ad\">radio ads</a> attacking a Republican primary opponent in 2009 for allegedly flip-flopping on the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosen said Tarkanian &quot;wants to defund Planned Parenthood and would outlaw a woman&#39;s right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tarkanian is ardently pro-life and has consistently said on multiple occasions he&rsquo;d support defunding Planned Parenthood and only supports allowing abortion access if continuing the pregnancy would threaten the mother&rsquo;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement is accurate, so we rate it as True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/477776ed-3467-4248-ae9e-c53684a3a4db\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/477776ed-3467-4248-ae9e-c53684a3a4db</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-03T19:32:28.082958", "ruling_date": "2016-08-04T11:33:22", "ruling_headline": "Democrat correctly points out Tarkanian's long-held abortion opposition", "ruling_headline_slug": "democrat-correctly-points-out-tarkanians-long-held", "ruling_link_text": "On the record, multiple times", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Phone interview with Danny Tarkanian campaign manager James Fisfis, Aug. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Jacky Rosen campaign spokesman Stewart Boss, Aug. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacky Rosen for Congress Press Release, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mq5U237-30BeA7Pix7Wlp6o78rAMZrjDcki4cwK1vBA/edit?usp=sharing\">&quot;PHOTOS: Jacky Rosen &amp;
