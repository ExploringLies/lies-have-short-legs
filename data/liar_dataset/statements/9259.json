Scott Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/114142609.html\"><u>augmented</u></a> the familiar Wisconsin-shaped signs at the state&rsquo;s borders<strong> </strong>that say: &quot;Wisconsin Welcomes You.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employing his campaign theme, Walker <a href=\"http://dailyreporter.com/files/2011/01/Speedy.jpg\"><u>attached small horizontal signs</u></a> that read, &quot;Open for Business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state paid a suburban Milwaukee company $1,495 to make the attachments to the 10-feet-tall and 11-feet-wide<strong> </strong>brown signs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years later, on April 18, 2014, the signs were raised by Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate, who appeared on a Madison-area radio station to comment on Walker&#39;s re-election announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tate criticized the Republican&#39;s record on creating jobs, then ridiculed him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The signs on our border that say &#39;Welcome to Wisconsin&#39; -- they&#39;ve always been made in Wisconsin,&quot; Tate <a href=\"http://www.slypodcasts.com/apps/blog/mike-tate-vs-scott-walker-round-3\"><u>told</u></a> liberal talk show host John &quot;Sly&quot; Sylvester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But now Scott Walker&#39;s DOA (Department of Administration) is outsourcing them -- I think to a company in Illinois, of all places -- and they&#39;re paying more money for them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A governor who is almost certain to break his promise to create <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/526/create-250000-new-jobs/\"><u>250,000 private-sector jobs</u></a> in his first term decides to have an out-of-state company make &quot;Welcome to Wisconsin&quot; signs -- at a higher price to the state?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ll see, Tate&#39;s statement from the beginning goes down the wrong road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Which signs?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff for evidence to back Tate&#39;s claim, she said Tate &quot;may have erred&quot; on the type of highway sign he singled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Tate is simply wrong in referring to the &quot;Wisconsin Welcomes You&quot; signs -- those 23 signs are not being replaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, Baldauff provided a few news articles about the state Department of Transportation deciding to change vendors on a contract for maintenance of a different type of sign -- the ubiquitous and much smaller <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/business/rules/images/sis.jpg\"><u>blue signs</u></a> near highway and freeway exits <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/business/rules/docs/sismap.pdf\"><u>throughout the state</u></a> that alert motorists to gas stations, restaurants and other businesses. Those signs typically carry the businesses&rsquo; logos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the DOT, the Legislature created the so-called <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/business/rules/property-signs-directional.htm\"><u>specific information signs</u></a> program in 1990 to promote certain types of businesses within five miles of a highway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is designed to be self-funded -- in other words, the businesses, not taxpayers, pay the cost of building and maintaining the blue signs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s an important point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only was Tate wrong in saying Walker was &quot;outsourcing&quot; the construction of the brown &quot;Wisconsin Welcomes You&quot; signs, he was wrong in suggesting that the outsourcing -- which actually refers to the maintenance of the blue roadway signs that &nbsp;promote businesses -- is being done at a higher cost to taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what led up to Tate&rsquo;s claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/firm-says-businesses-will-pay-more-for-wisconsin-highway-signs-b99198293z1-243551731.html\"><u>reported</u></a> in February 2014 that after 28 years of Milwaukee-based Derse-Wisconsin Highway Business Signs holding the blue signs contract, DOT had decided to give its next contract to Georgia-based Interstate Logos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DOT said Interstate Logos, which is subcontracting with a Portage, Wis., firm for part of the work, scored higher in the bid process that had been set up and would provide better signs and better service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the costs to businesses, Derse had proposed to charge $21 a month for signs along the interstate -- a reduction from the $30 it had charged for years -- and the same $10 a month it had been charging for signs along exit ramps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Interstate Logos proposed charging $46 per month for signs on the interstate, but no additional charge for signs on ramps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After DOT decided to give the contract to Interstate Logos, however, the company agreed to use $30 and $10 fees that Derse had been using. A 10-year contract was put in place to start May 1, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, businesses aren&rsquo;t facing a higher price under the new contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And none of that is paid by taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Criticizing Walker&rsquo;s record on job creation, Tate said Welcome to Wisconsin road signs have &quot;always been made in Wisconsin,&quot; but Walker &quot;is outsourcing them&quot; to an out-of-state company and &quot;paying more money for them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No changes are being made to the large &quot;Wisconsin Welcomes You&quot; signs near the state&rsquo;s borders. The state did give a sign maintenance contract to a Georgia firm, but businesses -- not state taxpayers -- pay for those small roadway signs and the prices in the contract are not increasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Tate&rsquo;s statement False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Comment on this item at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-are-those-welcome-to-wisconsin-signs-being-made-out-of-state-b99258899z1-257217761.html?page=1&amp;ipad=y\">website</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-29T16:07:20.870921", "ruling_date": "2014-04-30T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker outsourced the making of \"Welcome to Wisconsin\" road signs and is paying more for them, Democratic Party leader Mike Tate says", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-outsourced-making-welcome-wisconsin-r", "ruling_link_text": "No changes with the welcome signs", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>SlysOffice.com, John &quot;Sly&quot;
