The post said five people were killed in the crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also said that Starr was going to testify before &quot;special investigative committee that has recently found itself investigating crimes from the 1990s,&quot; led by U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no such committee, but Gowdy&rsquo;s name likely was invoked because he was chairman of the <a href=\"http://benghazi.house.gov/\">House Select Committee on Benghazi</a>. That committee submitted its <a href=\"https://benghazi.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-on-benghazi-releases-final-report-urges-obama-administration-to\">final report in July 2016</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starr&rsquo;s investigation into the Clintons, starting with former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster&rsquo;s death and the Whitewater land deal, eventually unearthed details of Bill Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/12/us/the-starr-report-full-text-of-findings-sent-to-congress-part-five-of-thirteen.html\">allegedly lying in a deposition about an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky</a>. The allegations in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/icreport.htm\">Starr Report</a> led to Bill Clinton&rsquo;s 1998 impeachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, Starr served as president and chancellor of Baylor University, but left amid accusations that he <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/08/ken-starr-baylor-university/496646/\">mishandled a sexual assault scandal</a> to protect players on the school&rsquo;s football team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the story that he died, its origins have roots in a well-known source of fabricated news. ConservativeFlashNews.com <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/remember-ken-starr-his-plane-just-disappeared-on-his-way-to-dc-to-tesitify/\">copied the story that appeared on the same date</a> on TheLastLineOfDefense.org.
