We found no evidence that Dion said either of these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rumor originated on a clickbait website in <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/celine-dion-flag-hate-this-country/\">September 2017</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/celine-dion-flag-hate-this-country/\">Snopes</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story doesn&rsquo;t support the headline. Instead, it talks about how Dion turned down an offer to sing at President Donald Trump&rsquo;s inauguration. In January 2017, <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/12/22/celine-dion-donald-trump-inauguration/\">news</a> <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/musicians-who-declined-trumps-inauguration.html\">outlets</a> such as TMZ reported that Dion passed up the opportunity, but not because she hates America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dion was actually scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration, which we were able to confirm with an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161202043255/http://www.thecolosseum.com/events\">archived version of her &nbsp;2017 schedule</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few paragraphs repeating the same information, the story cuts to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=21&amp;v=IvwX-Fd7_q4\">YouTube video</a> with a thumbnail of Dion. The 59-second video shares the same title as the blog post, but instead of Dion speaking, it&rsquo;s actually just a computer voiceover, saying, &quot;I can&rsquo;t even look at an American flag anymore, I hate this country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right after the &quot;quote,&quot; however, the voice-over contradicts the previous statement. It says that Dion is one of the most talented vocalists that &quot;ever existed.&quot; And although she is from Canada, her performance of <em>God Bless America</em> proves her &quot;true appreciation of our amazing country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-13T10:37:52.193103", "ruling_date": "2018-04-13T15:11:33", "ruling_headline": " Did Celine Dion say she hates this country?
