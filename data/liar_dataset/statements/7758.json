Bill Richardson caused a bit of a kerfuffle recently when he knocked Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for Cruz&rsquo;s skepticism about immigration legislation that&rsquo;s pending in Congress.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tDuring a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd0o6rPt8D4&amp;feature=player_embedded\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">web interview with ABC News</a>, host Benjamin Bell asked Richardson, &quot;Do you think he represents most Hispanics with his politics?&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;No,&quot; Richardson responded, &quot;He&rsquo;s anti-immigration. Almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform. No, I don&rsquo;t think he should be defined as a Hispanic. He&#39;s a politician from Texas, a conservative state.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCritics <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/05/06/bill-richardson-ted-cruz-should-not-be-defined-as-a-hispanic/\">later took Richardson to task</a> for seeming to judge whether another politician was &quot;Hispanic&quot; enough, and the former governor proceeded to clarify in a <a href=\"http://public.video.foxnews.com/services/player/bcpid1826433252001?bckey=AQ%7E%7E,AAABqUACmYk%7E,5yKviwdJq_9DHNwhRj_-biJu8n5uEHPS&amp;bctid=2360217869001\">Fox News interview</a> that while he and Cruz disagree on immigration, &quot;all I was saying is I don&rsquo;t consider myself just a Hispanic and he shouldn&rsquo;t be defined just as a Hispanic. We&rsquo;re other things. That&rsquo;s what I said.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t wade into the question of what Richardson meant when he described Cruz, but we did think it was worth looking at whether the evidence supports Richardson&rsquo;s claim that &quot;almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe decided to take a look at the available poll data to determine whether Hispanic support for immigration reform is anywhere close to universal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFinding poll data that speaks to this question is actually trickier than one might imagine. A typical national poll -- even one from a major survey firm -- usually doesn&rsquo;t have enough Hispanic respondents to produce reliable results. So we had to look at polls that are targeted at Hispanic voters, which are much less common. Frequently, these Hispanic-focused polls ask questions in both Spanish and English, which adds to their reliability.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll also note that Richardson used the term &quot;immigration reform,&quot; which has any number of definitions. For this analysis, we will focus on the immigration policies that would allow a path to citizenship or other benefits to illegal immigrants, since those are the highest-profile and in many cases most controversial aspects of immigration proposals currently being discussed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe found nine relevant questions over the past few years that polled Hispanics:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/02/21/section-1-opinions-about-major-issues/\">Pew Research Center, February 2013</a></strong>: &quot;What should be the priority for dealing with illegal immigration? Better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws, or creating a way for illegal immigrants to become citizens if they meet certain requirements?&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAmong Hispanics, 49 percent said both should be equal priorities and 41 percent said creating a path to citizenship should be the priority, for a combined score of <strong>90 percent</strong> supporting a path to citizenship. Eight percent said border security should be the priority. The poll surveyed 149 Hispanics, for a 9 percentage-point margin of error.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/28/most-say-illegal-immigrants-should-be-allowed-to-stay-but-citizenship-is-more-divisive/\">Pew Research Center, March 2013</a></strong>. &quot;Should illegal immigrants be allowed to stay in the country legally or not? If yes, should they be granted citizenship or permanent residency?&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAmong Hispanics,<strong> 80 percent</strong> said they should be able to stay legally, of which 49 percent opted for citizenship and 26 percent favored permanent residency. Seventeen percent said they should not be allowed to stay legally. The poll surveyed 155 Hispanics, with a roughly 9 percentage-point margin of error.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&bull;<strong> <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/10/11/latinos-and-immigration-policy/\">Pew Hispanic Center, October 2012</a></strong>. &quot;Do you approve of President Obama&rsquo;s program for unauthorized immigrants brought as children?&quot; (This policy offers relief from deportation for unauthorized immigrants younger than 30 who were brought into the country as children and who are currently enrolled in school or have obtained a high school diploma or GED.)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAmong Hispanics, <strong>89 percent</strong> approved of the policy, compared to 9 percent who disapproved.

Would you become a citizen or not?&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAlone among the polls listed here, this is the only one to specifically pose its question to undocumented immigrants. It found that <strong>87 percent</strong> of undocumented immigrants would apply for citizenship, a tacit indication that they approve of the policy.

The level of dissent among Hispanics is small, but it&#39;s not as infinitesimal as Richardson&rsquo;s comment suggests.
