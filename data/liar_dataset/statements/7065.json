You see a lot of folks with bad wrists, bad shoulders. When we&rsquo;re ready to retire, we&rsquo;ll need Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe concludes: &quot;Tommy Thompson has taken thousands of dollars from the insurance industry. Now he says he&rsquo;ll do away with Medicare. I&rsquo;m voting for Tammy Baldwin for Senate because she&rsquo;ll never cut Medicare benefits.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe liberal group&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nSNDgUii-zw#%21\"> TV spot</a> dissolves into a video of Thompson speaking to a tea-party group in June 2012, and seemingly proves the group&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Who better than me to do away with Medicaid and Medicare?&quot; Thompson asks in the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe are quite familiar with the video clip.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-still-working-to-win-over-conservative-voters-2h5sfrb-160081175.html\">Journal Sentinel reported</a> on it in June 2012. And Baldwin quoted Thompson&rsquo;s statement from it while addressing a group of liberal bloggers. Now, as the tight Senate race draws to a close, the same clip is showing up in several anti-Thompson ads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn evaluating Baldwin&rsquo;s claim in June, we found that Thompson did utter those words at a June 4, 2012, appearance before the<a href=\"http://lakecountryareadefendersofliberty.webs.com/\"> Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty</a>, an Oconomowoc-based group that decries excessive government and endorses &quot;demolishing the growing, socialist &lsquo;nanny state&rsquo; and its programs and legislation...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also learned that&rsquo;s only part of what Thompson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor starters, the brief video clip in the Progressive Change ad is edited for effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you look closely, Thompson&rsquo;s head jerks oddly during the &quot;Who better than me&hellip;&quot; statement. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s spliced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the full quote: &quot;Who better than me, (who&rsquo;s) already finished one of the entitlement programs and come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn June, we rated<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/28/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-wants-do-away-medicare/\"> Half True</a> -- partially accurate -- Baldwin&rsquo;s claim that Thompson &quot;said&quot; he wants to &quot;do away with Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked the Progressive Change Campaign Committee to back up the ad&rsquo;s claim, spokesman Neil Sroka said Thompson&rsquo;s words were clear. Thompson was speaking candidly about his real view of Ryan&rsquo;s plan, in front of a conservative group whose support he was seeking, Sroka said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s take a fuller look, then, at Thompson&rsquo;s June speech -- and see if anything has changed since our rating of the claim when Baldwin made it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the tea-party event, Thompson prefaced the remarks in question by saying Medicare will be broke within a decade and the only way to save it is to give people who turn 55 starting in 2022 a choice of traditional Medicare or purchasing health insurance with a subsidy from the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt that point, Thompson was fully endorsing U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan&rsquo;s plan to reform Medicare, but recently he&rsquo;s emphasized a plan that modestly modifies Ryan&rsquo;s. As we noted on Nov. 2, 2012, in giving Thompson a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/01/tommy-thompson/testing-thompsons-position-ryans-medicare-reform-p/\"> Half Flip</a>, he now wants to offer future seniors who don&rsquo;t pick traditional Medicare the option of picking a private plan in the federal employees&rsquo; health program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the tea-party speech, Thompson wrapped his argument for Medicare reform in the language of wiping it away and starting fresh.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, he harkened back to his days as Wisconsin governor, and his first-in-the-nation move to replace welfare with a work requirement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told the audience the United States should &quot;change Medicare and Medicaid like I did welfare.&quot; (We previously rated as<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/11/tommy-thompson/did-gop-us-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-end-wel/\"> Mostly True</a> Thompson&rsquo;s claim that he &quot;ended welfare&quot; in Wisconsin.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen he said the line about who better than him to &quot;come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s clear that Thompson was comfortable uttering the phrase &quot;doing away with Medicare&quot; in the middle of a recitation of his views on transforming the program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there is another piece of background relevant to his views: Thompson didn&rsquo;t say it at the event, but he<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/130949388.html#%21page=5&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\"> told the Journal Sentinel</a> in 2011 he firmly believes seniors will choose the private insurance option under Ryan&rsquo;s plan instead of government-run care. Of government-run healthcare, he said he&rsquo;s &quot;always opposed&quot; it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his 2011 remarks, Thompson said government-run Medicare could disappear if people are allowed to opt out of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the same time, it&rsquo;s clear that deeper into the June tea-party speech, after the statement in question, Thompson said he was interested in &quot;saving&quot; Medicare from fiscal extinction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe also framed his views as wanting to &quot;change&quot; Medicare, though in the context of his elimination of welfare in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack in June, the Thompson campaign said it was not a misstatement by the candidate. Campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir offered this somewhat contradictory explanation: Thompson used the phrase &quot;doing away with&quot; in the context of &quot;changing&quot; Medicare, not eliminating it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn early October, after another liberal group used the tea-party video clip, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/tommy-thompson-says-he-wouldn-t-eliminate-medicare-medicaid/article_595400ec-0f45-11e2-a4c8-0019bb2963f4.html\">Thompson told reporters</a>: I am here to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security but you have to make some adjustments.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, where does that leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSame place as before. The PCCC ad leaves out important context from Thompson&rsquo;s June remarks, just as Baldwin did. But Thompson did describe his reform plan, in that speech, as a way to &quot;do away with&quot; traditional Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-02T17:27:10.379233", "ruling_date": "2012-11-02T18:22:53", "ruling_headline": "Progressive group says Thompson \"says he'll do away with Medicare\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "progressive-group-says-thompson-says-hell-do-away-", "ruling_link_text": "Said that, and more", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tProgressive Change Campaign Committee, TV ad, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nSNDgUii-zw#%21\">&quot;Stop Tommy Thompson,&quot;</a>Oct. 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/28/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-wants-do-away-medicare/\">&quot;Baldwin says Thompson said he wants to &lsquo;do away with Medicare,&rsquo;</a>&quot; June 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-still-working-to-win-over-conservative-voters-2h5sfrb-160081175.html\">&quot;Tea party group grills Thompson,</a>&quot; June 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/01/tommy-thompson/testing-thompsons-position-ryans-medicare-reform-p/\">&quot;Testing Tommy Thompson&rsquo;s position on Ryan&rsquo;s Medicare reform plan,</a>&quot; Nov. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/130949388.html#%21page=5&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">&quot;GOP candidates can&rsquo;t avoid Ryan&rsquo;s Medicare plan,</a>&quot; Oct. 2, 2011<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 216, "last_name": "Progressive Change Campaign Committee", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "progressive-change-campaign-committee", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Group_image.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/216/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson &quot;says he&rsquo;ll do away with Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV ad", "statement_date": "2012-10-31", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 50, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/50/", "subject": "Medicare", "subject_slug": "medicare", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Tommy", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 14, "last_name": "Thompson", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "tommy-thompson", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-tommythompson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/14/", "total_count": 29, "true_count": 3, "website": "https://www.tommyforwisconsin.com/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=2&gclid=CPiG95D88qwCFUJjTAodElamlg"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
