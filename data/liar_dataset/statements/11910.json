Joseph Stalin said, &lsquo;If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.&rsquo; We, the people, can stop that decline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that in all likelihood, this is not a real quote from the former Soviet leader. Stalin led the communist nation from the 1920s until his death in 1953, and it is believed that millions died during his regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Searches for the quote do not turn up in any history books, scholarly works or primary sources. Mostly it&rsquo;s just <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=stalin+america+is+like+a+healthy+body&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8uNDUs_bKAhWD5yYKHUjuDGMQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=1383&amp;bih=686&amp;dpr=0.9\">social media sharables</a> with the quote text next to a picture of Stalin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our friends over at <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/undermine.asp\">Snopes</a> looked into a similar quote and concluded that it&rsquo;s &quot;highly unlikely that Stalin ever spoke these words.&quot; It seems dubious that Stalin would say something like this, as the quote, in a sense, compliments America for its strengths, Snopes noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched through an online <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/search.htm\">Stalin Archive</a> and an <a href=\"http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Stalin%2c%20Joseph%2c%201879-1953\">online library</a> compiled by the University of Pennsylvania. Our searches came up empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s unclear where this quote originated. The earliest use of the quote Snopes found was in <a href=\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oyUzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XOgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6829,4552530&amp;dq=america-is-like-a-healthy-body&amp;hl=en\">a 1983 letter to the editor in a Kansas newspaper</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Stalin said this quote in a speech or in a letter that was never translated into English or never put on the Internet. But the burden is on Carson to back up his words with evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If new evidence pops up to the contrary, we&rsquo;ll revisit this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Carson&rsquo;s campaign but haven&rsquo;t heard back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson quoted Stalin as saying, &quot;If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All signs point to this being a fake quote that has made its way around the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Carson&rsquo;s claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-14T00:21:39.024176", "ruling_date": "2016-02-14T00:00:15", "ruling_headline": "Ben Carson repeats dubious Stalin quote about bringing down America in CBS debate", "ruling_headline_slug": "ben-carson-flubs-stalin-quote-about-bringing-down-", "ruling_link_text": "Where did it come from?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Snopes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/undermine.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Joseph Stalin described America as a healthy body with three fold resistance,&quot;</u></a> November 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marxists.org, <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/index.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Stalin Internet Archive</u></a>, accessed Feb. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Pennsylvania, <a href=\"http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Stalin%2c%20Joseph%2c%201879-1953\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Stalin online books library</u></a>, accessed Feb. 13, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "Ben", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 3108, "last_name": "Carson", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "ben-carson", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/MCT_US_NEWS_CAMPAIGN-CPAC_2.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3108/", "total_count": 28, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.bencarson.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says &quot;Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a GOP debate on CBS", "statement_date": "2016-02-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
