And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1 percent income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at,&quot; said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DNC said that the Republicans &quot;passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the case by 2027, due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. The DNC is cherry-picking by focusing on the tax bill&rsquo;s impact by 2027, rather than the impact for the nearly a decade leading up to then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-16T16:40:29.079245", "ruling_date": "2018-01-16T17:30:16", "ruling_headline": "DNC offers one-sided view on who gets tax bill's benefits", "ruling_headline_slug": "dnc-offers-one-sided-view-who-gets-tax-bills-benef", "ruling_link_text": "Not true until about a decade from now", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Democratic National Committee, &quot;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@TheDemocrats/trump-at-one-year-president-for-the-1-92d19feb4996\">Trump At One Year: President For The 1%</a>,&quot; Jan. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act\">Distributional Analysis of the Conference Agreement for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>,&quot; Dec. 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Joseph Rosenberg, senior research associate with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, Jan. 16, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "", "id": 26, "last_name": "Democratic National Committee", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "democratic-national-committee", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-dnc.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/26/", "total_count": 37, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The Republicans and President Donald Trump&nbsp;&quot;passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Medium post", "statement_date": "2018-01-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "DNC offers one-sided view on who gets tax bill's benefits"}
