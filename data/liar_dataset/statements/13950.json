You know, the real number&#39;s not 4.6 percent (for the unemployment rate). They told me I had 4.6 percent last month. I&#39;m doing great. I said yeah, but what about the hundred million people? A lot of those people came out and voted for me. I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people -- a good percentage of them would like to have jobs and they don&#39;t. You know, one of the statistics that, to me, is just ridiculous -- so, the 4.6 sounds good. But when you look for a job, you can&#39;t find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed. But I don&#39;t consider those people employed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Trump right that &quot;when you look for a job, you can&#39;t find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed&quot;? Not at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump seems to suggest that government statisticians are performing something like medieval alchemy, turning lead (unemployment) into gold (employment) with the flick of a wand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not the case. Broadly speaking, if someone is already considered unemployed and they give up looking for a job, they would be counted as &quot;not in the labor force&quot; -- not as &quot;employed.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, there is an official statistical category for a person in this situation. If someone wants and looks for a job but then gives up, they are called &quot;discouraged workers.&quot; Specifically, these people &quot;want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months&quot; but are &quot;not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem for Trump is that &quot;discouraged workers&quot; are relatively rare -- in the most recent month, there were 522,000 of them. That&rsquo;s just one-fourteenth the number of unemployed workers, and only about one-half of 1 percent of the &quot;out of work&quot; Americans Trump seems to have been referring to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of which, as we have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/28/fact-checking-donald-trumps-address-congress/\">noted previously</a>, Trump&rsquo;s 100-million figure of &quot;out of work&quot; Americans is highly misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This number -- in reality, a bit lower at 94 million -- includes any American age 16 and over who isn&rsquo;t institutionalized and who isn&rsquo;t either working or actively looking for work. This means the figure includes retirees, high school students over 16, undergraduate and graduate students, stay-at-home parents, disabled people, adults who are engaged in full-time education or training, and even trust-fund kids and those wealthy enough to be living off investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the figure includes a lot of people who wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to be working, or who are engaged in other pursuits. We have previously estimated that no more than a quarter of the 94 million people not in the labor market are either out of work, looking for a job, or eager to get back in the job hunt if labor-market conditions were to improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s a chart from the jobs site Indeed.com showing one analysis of the reasons that prime-working-age Americans may not be working.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So suggesting that roughly 100 million Americans are out of work ropes in many people who, in fact, have no desire to find paid employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;When you look for a job, you can&#39;t find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed.&quot; That&rsquo;s flat wrong -- someone who stops looking for work would be shifted to the &quot;out of the labor force&quot; category, not the &quot;employed category.&quot; We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-04T14:19:05.204792", "ruling_date": "2017-04-04T14:59:02", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump flubs how unemployment is calculated", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-flubs-how-unemployment-calculated", "ruling_link_text": "That's not how it's calculated", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5077092?5\">remarks at a CEO town hall</a>, April 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/28/fact-checking-donald-trumps-address-congress/\">Fact-checking Donald Trump&#39;s address to Congress</a>,&quot; Feb. 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-pants-fire-claim-unemployment/\">Donald Trump repeats Pants on Fire claim that unemployment rate could be 42 percent</a>,&quot; Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-has-93-milion-people-out-work/\">Donald Trump says U.S. has 93 million people &#39;out of work,&#39; but that&#39;s way too high</a>,&quot; Aug. 31, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jed Kolko, chief economist for Indeed.com, April 4, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When you look for a job, you can&#39;t find it and you give up.
