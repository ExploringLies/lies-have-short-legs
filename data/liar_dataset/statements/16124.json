Martha McSally is promoting herself to Arizonans as someone who&rsquo;s led the fight to guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally, a Republican running for the state&rsquo;s open Senate seat, says in a new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmcSaKZFgw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">ad</a> that she is &quot;leading the fight to secure our border, force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and protect girls and women from sex trafficking.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has McSally, an Air Force veteran, led the fight to &quot;force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not what her voting record shows. McSally in 2015 voted for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, she voted for a repeal and replace bill that health care law experts say undermined the Affordable Care Act. It is the Affordable Care Act that forces insurers to cover pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally is competing against Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who&rsquo;s also taken credit for protecting Arizonans&rsquo; health coverage. (See our <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/kyrsten-sinema/\">fact-checks</a> of Sinema&rsquo;s claims.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">McSally&rsquo;s voting record</div>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally has aligned with the Republican Party&rsquo;s goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, the health care bill signed into law by former president Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions (health problems people had before a new coverage started). Insurers also were able to charge higher premiums based on health status. The Affordable Care Act <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/oct/14/health-care-five-charts-midterm-guide/\">prohibited those practices</a>, effectively forcing companies to insure people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally in February 2015 <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll058.xml\">voted for a full repeal</a> of the Affordable Care Act. The bill directed House committees to offer new legislative proposals, including one with a provision to &quot;provide people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage.&quot;&nbsp;That <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/596/actions\">bill</a> passed the House, 239-186, but died in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2017, McSally also <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll256.xml\">voted in favor</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/text\">American Health Care Act</a>, a Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It passed the House, 217-213, but again, failed in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">How would the American Health Care Act affect coverage for pre-existing conditions?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally and other Republicans <a href=\"https://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/us-rep-mcsally-s-statement-passage-american-health-care-act\">say</a> that although they want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, they also want to protect people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, Torunn Sinclair, said McSally &quot;played a large role&quot; behind the scenes in the American Health Care Act&rsquo;s amendment process. &quot;Especially by setting the tone with leadership and other members that pre-existing conditions must be protected,&quot; Sinclair said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Health Care Act said nothing in it &quot;shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it also allowed states to apply for <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/\">waivers</a> to certain Affordable Care Act rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In states with a &quot;community rating&quot; waiver, insurers would have been <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2018/oct/11/abigail-spanberger/spanberger-ad-exaggerates-brats-vote-pre-existing-/\">able to raise premiums</a>, for one year, for people with pre-existing health conditions who did not have coverage for at least 63 straight days the previous year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congressional Budget Office in a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/hr1628aspassed.pdf\">analysis</a> said that less-healthy people, including those with pre-existing conditions, would ultimately be unable to buy individual health insurance (policies not tied to an employer) at premiums comparable to those under the Affordable Care Act, &quot;if they could purchase it at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Additional funding from Upton/Long amendment</div>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2017 debate for the American Health Care Act, McSally &quot;successfully negotiated $8 billion in additional funding to bring down insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions,&quot; her campaign said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally <a href=\"https://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/us-rep-mcsally-s-statement-passage-american-health-care-act\">supported</a> a last-minute measure known as the <a href=\"https://upton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398795\">Upton-Long amendment</a> to help secure enough votes to pass the American Health Care Act in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amendment, offered by Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Billy Long of Missouri, made available $8 billion over five years to states granted a community rating waiver. The funds were intended to help reduce premiums or other out-of-pocket medical expenses for people with pre-existing conditions whose monthly premiums increased because of the waiver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyses and news reports at the time said it was uncertain how many states would apply for the waiver; the number would tell how the $8 billion would be allocated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Experts find shortcomings in McSally&rsquo;s claim</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Health care law experts say McSally&rsquo;s claim overlooks protections established by the Affordable Care Act, downplays the impact of the American Health Care Act, and overstates the Upton-Long amendment&rsquo;s reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican measures would not have forced insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions &mdash; they already had to because of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Health Care Act, on the contrary, weakened coverage protections, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The AHCA&rsquo;s state waivers would have made it much more expensive and, in some cases, effectively impossible for people with pre-existing conditions to obtain coverage,&quot; said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings Institution&rsquo;s Economic Studies Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Upton-Long amendment &quot;did very little to undo those adverse effects,&quot; Fiedler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amendment could be helpful to some extent, &quot;but offering a moderate level of financial assistance falls well short of &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions,&quot; said David Gamage, a law professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bottom line is that the American Health Care Act undermined the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to be able to maintain adequate coverage at affordable price,&quot; said Allison K. Hoffman, a law professor at Penn Law School. &quot;And then amendments like the Upton-Long amendment tried to soften the blow of some of these harms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposal said nothing in it was to be construed as permitting insurers to limit coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. But experts said that was &quot;vague catch-all language,&quot; and that the bill included avenues for states to undermine that coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally claimed she&rsquo;s &quot;leading the fight&quot; to &quot;force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the Obama-era Affordable Care Act that forced insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally in 2015 voted in favor of a full repeal of the law. The bill directed House committees to offer new proposals, including one that provided people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, McSally voted for the American Health Care Act, a Republican proposal that kept the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s pre-existing conditions coverage. Despite language in the bill to protect people with pre-existing conditions, it included provisions that undermined that coverage and increased premiums for certain people, making insurance unaffordable in some cases, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally did support an amendment to help reduce over 5 years increased premiums and out-of-pocket expenses that people with pre-existing conditions might face due to a state waiver allowed in the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally&rsquo;s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
