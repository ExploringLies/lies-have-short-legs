Instead of going back to the days of billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record job loss, let&rsquo;s keep moving Wisconsin forward.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s some broad language.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo broad, some would think the double-digit increases were a fact of life for most residents. While widespread jobs losses in the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html\">recession</a> and the deficit Walker inherited are well known, we wondered what Walker meant by &quot;double-digit tax increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/01/17/interview_with_wisconsin_governor_walker\">repeated</a> the &quot;double-digit tax increases&quot; claim on Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s national radio talk show on Jan. 17, 2012, the day before petitions seeking the recall election were <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/recall18-8g3r7ui-137489833.html\">submitted</a>. And he did it again the next day, <a href=\"http://www.scottwalker.org/press-release/2012/01/friends-scott-walker-reaction-announcement-kathleen-falk\">claiming</a> Democratic recall candidate <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/kathleen-falk/\">Kathleen </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/kathleen-falk/\">Falk</a> intends to &quot;take Wisconsin back to the days&quot; of double-digit tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s see if that&rsquo;s what state Democrats did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats did boost taxes with the 2009-2011 state budget and a 2009 budget adjustment bill. We found, when rating a $5 billion claim by Walker running mate <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rebecca-kleefisch/\">Rebecca Kleefisch</a> as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/28/rebecca-kleefisch/republican-lieutenant-governor-candidate-rebecca-k/\">False</a>, that the two measures raised taxes and fees by just over $3 billion over the two-year period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBen Sparks, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Walker&rsquo;s double-digit claim refers to the same two budget measures. In a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Double+Digit+Increases.docx\">document</a> Sparks provided, Walker cites three sets of tax changes to back his claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>School property taxes</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker said that, because of the Democrats&rsquo; 2009-2011 budget, school property tax levies would have increased an estimated <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Property+Tax+Estimates+Under+Alternate+Assumptions-+LFB+2011+07+15+-+Copy.pdf\">17.3 </a><a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Property+Tax+Estimates+Under+Alternate+Assumptions-+LFB+2011+07+15+-+Copy.pdf\">percent</a> in 2011 had he not taken the steps he did with his 2011-2013 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHmmm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the ad, Walker flatly claimed that Democrats raised taxes by double-digits. Now he&rsquo;s talking about a hypothetical -- indeed, one that didn&rsquo;t occur.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike any governor, Walker had the opportunity to fashion his own budget. And with a Republican-controlled Legislature, he cut state aid to schools and school districts&rsquo; ability to raise property tax revenues. The result: 2011 school levies dropped <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/school-levies-drop-statewide-sparking-debate-o932ne3-133929583.html\">1 percent</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about the other two tax changes Walker cites?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Business taxes</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker contends Democrats raised business taxes by $456 million, or 28 percent, over two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong other things, he cited the Democratic adoption of &quot;<a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2007-09-Budget/Documents/2009_02_23Act2.pdf\">combined reporting</a>,&quot; which taxes a relatively small number of Wisconsin-based businesses on income from subsidiaries outside the state, rather than only those within Wisconsin. That tax is estimated to raise $187 million over two years. He also cited elimination of a tax deduction for <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2009-11-Budget/Documents/Budget%20Papers/361.pdf\">domestic production</a>, which is estimated to increase corporate income tax payments by nearly $72 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDale Knapp, research director of the nonprofit <a href=\"http://wistax.org/\">Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance</a>, said there isn&rsquo;t a good base on which to calculate the $450 million increase. But roughly $350 million of that increase is to be paid in corporate income taxes, which is roughly an increase of 21 percent, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, that material is generally on point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s left?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Miscellaneous taxes</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker cites a number of double-digit tax increases the Democrats made, including a 42 percent hike in the tax on <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2009-11-Budget/Documents/Budget%20Papers/385.pdf\">cigarettes</a> to $2.52 per pack; more than doubling the $75 per-bed per-month assessment paid by <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2009-11-Budget/Documents/Budget%20Papers/430.pdf\">nursing homes</a>; and more than doubling the <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2009-11-Budget/Documents/Budget%20Papers/590.pdf\">&quot;tipping fee&quot;</a> charged to landfills, which is ultimately passed on to garbage generators such as families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur own research turned up one Walker didn&rsquo;t cite.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democrats raised the top income tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.75 percent. That 1-percentage-point increase amounts to a 15 percent boost in the rate itself. The change caused a 13.5 percent increase in the actual tax paid by people with an adjusted gross income of $1 million or more, <a href=\"http://wistax.org/publication/income-taxes-show-effects-of-tax-hikes-recession\">according</a> to the taxpayers alliance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a TV ad, Walker said the Democratic administration and Legislature that preceded him approved &quot;double-digit tax increases.&quot; There certainly were not widespread double-digit increases in the taxes most people directly pay -- income taxes and the sales tax. But there are a variety of other tax increases that rose by double digits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Walker&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-24T16:58:35.080610", "ruling_date": "2012-01-25T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Fighting recall, Wisconsin Gov.
