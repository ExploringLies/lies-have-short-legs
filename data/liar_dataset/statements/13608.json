It included a disturbing photo overprinted with &quot;Yamstar.com,&quot; purporting to show cooked canines being butchered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged the article as being potentially fake as part of its efforts to root out fake news on the website. This unpalatable tale certainly qualifies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story, rife with odd punctuation and capitalization, claimed that an eatery called China Chow had been serving dogs slaughtered in the back of the restaurant as a special-order menu item for customers who asked for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said police shut the restaurant down after a two-month investigation following a customer complaint, according to a faux department spokesman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the dog lovers out there, take heart that none of these things happened. A Coral Springs Police Department employee told PolitiFact that nothing about the story is true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Community Involvement Coordinator Lynne Martzall said there was no two-month investigation by the department, and the police spokesman named in the story is not a real person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, there is no restaurant named China Chow in Coral Springs, and there is no Chinese restaurant at the intersection named in the fake story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(We did notice that there is <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/china-chow-coral-springs\">a fictional Yelp profile of China Chow</a>, but it only links back to the same story, published the same day on <a href=\"http://gummypost.com/chines-restaurant-coral-spring-florida-got-busted-selling-dog-meat-special-menu/\">GummyPost.com</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After receiving complaints, the department had <a href=\"http://archive.is/9ycpK\">posted a message</a> on its Facebook page in December to tell the public the story was totally contrived. Martzall said Facebook removed the post from the department&rsquo;s page after police reported the story as fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to contact the administrator at MajorThoughts.com, which is registered to <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/majorthoughts.com\">an address in Sunrise, Fla.</a>, but we didn&rsquo;t get a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides basing its claim on a racist stereotype of Chinese eating dogs, this fake story makes up every detail it cites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this distasteful fabrication Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/054ce95b-88b0-433c-8e91-8384128c6efb\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/054ce95b-88b0-433c-8e91-8384128c6efb</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-11T11:48:17.680396", "ruling_date": "2017-01-11T16:12:09", "ruling_headline": "Fake news: There's no Chinese restaurant selling dog meat in Coral Springs, Fla.", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-news-theres-no-chinese-restaurant-selling-dog", "ruling_link_text": "Serving up false details in made up story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>MajorThoughts.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://majorthoughts.com/chines-restaurant-in-coral-spring-florida-got-busted-for-selling-dog-meat-as-special-menu/\">Chinese Restaurant In Coral Springs,Florida Busted For Selling Dog Meat To VIP Customers</a>,&quot; Dec. 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GummyPost.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://gummypost.com/chines-restaurant-coral-spring-florida-got-busted-selling-dog-meat-special-menu/\">Chinese restaurant in coral Springs florida got busted for selling dog meat as special menu</a>,&quot; Dec. 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archive.is, <a href=\"http://archive.is/9ycpK\">CSPD Facebook post</a>, Dec. 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yelp.com, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/china-chow-coral-springs\">China Chow reviews</a>, accessed Jan. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Lynne Martzall, Coral Springs Police Department Community Involvement Coordinator, Jan. 10, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Chinese restaurant in Coral Springs, Fla., busted for selling dog meat to VIP customers.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2016-12-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
