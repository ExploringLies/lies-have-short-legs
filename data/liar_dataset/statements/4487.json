But the final version added more types of IDs and made it easier to cast provisional ballots, something we also <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2011/jun/12/does-wisconsins-new-voter-id-law-disenfranchise-vo/\">looked at in the past</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn any case, the law makes no distinction about voters with any particular party affiliation. The requirements apply to every eligible voter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked DGA spokesman <a href=\"http://www.democraticgovernors.org/about/staff\">Mark </a><a href=\"http://www.democraticgovernors.org/about/staff\">Giangreco</a> for evidence to back the statement in the ad, which he said began running in May 2011 and will continue running indefinitely. He said it&rsquo;s clear Walker&rsquo;s actions &quot;make it more difficult for traditionally Democratic constituencies to cast a ballot.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s not what the ad says. It says Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group cited four points as evidence:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Photo ID law discourages voting</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group said the law would discourage traditionally Democratic voters from voting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDGA cited two news articles about Walker signing the legislation. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/25/wisconsin-voter-id-law-scott-walker_n_867090.html\">One</a> quoted Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate as saying the law would have the most impact on &quot;the elderly, students, shut-ins, African-Americans, Latinos and other groups that tend to vote Democratic,&quot; from voting. <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/article_5aa8adfa-7845-11e0-82be-001cc4c03286.html\">Another</a> said no colleges in the state use IDs that meet the law&rsquo;s requirements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDGA also cited a <a href=\"http://ashlandcurrent.com/article/11/01/27/jauch-says-voter-id-bill-disenfranchises-voters\">statement</a> by state Sen. Bob Jauch, D-Poplar, that 175,000 state residents over 65 don&rsquo;t have driver&#39;s licenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats argue that making voting more difficult through the bill will discourage traditionally Democratic voters from casting a ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s certainly true that some residents don&rsquo;t have driver&rsquo;s licenses, but free IDs are available; and, since the law was signed, a state agency has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/129658578.html\">made it </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/129658578.html\">possible</a> for colleges to add a sticker to student IDs to allow them to be used for voting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegardless, adding a requirement that applies across the board does not deny Democrats -- specifically -- the right to vote any more than the requirement that voters be 18 and <a href=\"http://gab.wi.gov/elections-voting/voters/registration-voting\">register to vote</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Passage of law was rushed</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DGA said photo ID was adopted too quickly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiangreco cited a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/07/wisconsin-recall-election_n_859011.html\">quote</a> from Kevin Kennedy, head of the state Government Accountability Board, who said before the law was signed: &quot;There has been no time for the careful evaluation and vetting needed to ensure the best options for voters and election officials is enacted.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that statement says nothing about denying any voting rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Lack of photo IDs</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDGA said many voters don&rsquo;t have photo IDs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe association cited an <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/citizens_without_proof_stands_strong/\">opinion </a><a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/citizens_without_proof_stands_strong/\">article</a> by the New York University School of Law&rsquo;s Brennan Center for Justice. It noted a 2006 Brennan report that said 11 percent of voting-age American citizens -- and a greater percentage of African-American, low-income and older citizens -- do not have current and valid government-issued photo IDs. The article also cited other studies, although none was specific to Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat essentially repeats the earlier point about some residents needing to obtain a photo ID. But that&rsquo;s different than denying someone the right to vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Lack of access to photo IDs</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DGA said voters in some Democratic areas of the state would find it more difficult to obtain a photo ID if a plan by Walker to close some state Division of Motor Vehicles offices was adopted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe association cited a news <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9OKSP800.htm\">article</a> published two months after the DGA began running its ad. The article reported that a Democratic state lawmaker said the Walker administration&rsquo;s plan to close DMV offices in traditionally Democratic areas, while expanding operation hours of DMV offices in Republican districts, seemed to be based on politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe administration said closures would be based on economics, but <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/126814653.html\">dropped the </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/126814653.html\">plan</a> in August 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, this evidence surfaced after the ad began running and is no longer even on the table.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe see a pattern here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DGA&rsquo;s evidence essentially amounts to a prediction that the photo ID law would cause some voters who tend to back Democrats to stop voting. Giangreco replied by saying: &quot;I think that the (photo ID) law is tantamount to denying people the right to vote.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s arguable -- and it&rsquo;s not what is claimed in the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic Governors Association said Walker &quot;is denying Democrats the right to vote.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt can be argued that Wisconsin&rsquo;s photo ID law will lead some people who tend to vote for Democrats to stop voting. It&rsquo;s certainly true that most Wisconsin residents who don&rsquo;t have a photo ID will have to get one in order to vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut words matter. The association goes too far in saying Walker is denying Democrats the right to vote. That is simply not the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim as Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-22T17:28:02.176156", "ruling_date": "2011-09-25T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrats group says Wisconsin Gov.
