Hodgkinson had slammed Handel for her opposition to increasing&nbsp;the minimum wage&nbsp;in a profanity-laced tirade he <a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/news/hodgkinson-penned-rant-against-karen-handel-on-social-media/448920518\">posted</a> a week before the mass shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Handel called for calm and unity in response to those reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks.
