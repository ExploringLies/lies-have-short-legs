This is historic.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCurrently, the U.S. has active military deployments of varying types in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and central Africa. The last mission -- which could involve boots on the ground in Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- was <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/14/letter-president-speaker-house-representatives-and-president-pro-tempore\">announced</a> just days before the debate by President Barack Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the White House, this latest mission involves &quot;approximately 100&quot; combat-equipped U.S. forces to aid ongoing efforts by African nations to counter a long-running battle with the Lord&#39;s Resistance Army, a guerilla group infamous for killing families and forcibly conscripting the remaining children as soldiers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered whether Bachmann was correct that four simultaneous U.S. deployments represented a significant landmark for the use of U.S. forces abroad. So we turned to a report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rl30172.pdf\">Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, </a><a href=\"http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rl30172.pdf\">1798-2006</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause of the start and end date of the document&rsquo;s data, we don&rsquo;t have full information on deployments through 2011. But there are more than enough instances throughout recent U.S. history to demonstrate that four deployments is not a high-water mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found a few periods prior to 1990 in which the number of separate overseas deployments came close to reaching four -- including 1899, 1912, 1916 and 1919 -- but in each case we took a more cautious path because we couldn&rsquo;t be 100 percent sure that the specific dates for those deployments overlapped.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut beginning in 1993, we found that it was almost always the default that U.S. troops were actively deployed in at least four separate locations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t overwhelm you with a torrent of dates and locations. Instead, we&rsquo;ll list two periods -- the 1990s and the 2000s -- each with one list of nations where the U.S. had long-term deployments and another list of nations where the U.S. briefly committed troops, such as for a rescue of diplomatic personnel or American civilians. For the 2000s, we&rsquo;ll also add a special category of nations for which the U.S. disclosed that it had dispatched troops for training and preparation for post-9/11 antiterrorism training and other operations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Long deployments, 1993-2000</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBosnia / Macedonia<br />\r\n\tEast Timor<br />\r\n\tFormer Yugoslavia / Kosovo<br />\r\n\tHaiti<br />\r\n\tIraq no-fly zone</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Short deployments, 1993-2000</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfghanistan (airstrike only)<br />\r\n\tAlbania<br />\r\n\tBurundi<br />\r\n\tCentral African Republic<br />\r\n\tKenya<br />\r\n\tLiberia<br />\r\n\tSierra Leone<br />\r\n\tSomalia<br />\r\n\tSudan (airstrike only)<br />\r\n\tTanzania<br />\r\n\tYemen<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Long deployments, 2001-06</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfghanistan<br />\r\n\tBosnia<br />\r\n\tFormer Yugoslavia / Kosovo<br />\r\n\tIraq War<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Short deployments, 2001-06</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCote D&rsquo;Ivoire<br />\r\n\tEast Timor<br />\r\n\tHaiti<br />\r\n\tLebanon<br />\r\n\tLiberia<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Global War on Terror deployments, 2001-06</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDjibouti<br />\r\n\tEritrea<br />\r\n\tEthiopia<br />\r\n\tGeorgia<br />\r\n\tKenya<br />\r\n\tPhillipines<br />\r\n\tYemen<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to our count, from 1993 to 2006, the number of simultaneous deployments dropped below four only for one year -- 1997. Otherwise, the U.S. was juggling at least four and sometimes eight or nine deployments at once.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot all of these previous deployments were equal in scope. Some lasted years and involved ground troops; some lasted just a few days; some were primarily based on air power. But that&#39;s also true today. Afghanistan and Iraq are years-long operations with ground forces, while Libya has been a NATO operation in which the U.S. did not have large numbers of troops on the ground. The mission against the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army, meanwhile, looks like some of the smaller operations from the past two decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo make sure we weren&rsquo;t missing context, we asked military historians whether they thought our analysis was sound. The two who responded -- Ted Wilson, a history professor at the University of Kansas, and William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia -- agreed that Bachmann was wrong to suggest that four simultaneous deployments represented any kind of landmark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA look through history suggests that, contrary to Bachmann&rsquo;s claim, having four simultaneous military deployments is not only not a landmark, it&rsquo;s actually become the norm for the U.S. since 1993.
