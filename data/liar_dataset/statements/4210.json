Chris Christie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a July 20 press release, One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said: &quot;After nearly two years of Christie&rsquo;s bluster, middle-class and working families are far worse-off than when he took office &ndash; with less jobs and higher property taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this Truth-O-Meter item, PolitiFact New Jersey is focusing on Henne&rsquo;s claim that New Jersey has fewer jobs now than when Christie took office in January 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter reviewing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the number of non-farm jobs in New Jersey has fluctuated between growth and decline throughout Christie&rsquo;s tenure. But when Henne made his statement, there was a net increase of jobs, federal data shows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain how labor statistics are compiled.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal labor statistics are measured through two monthly surveys: household interviews and reports from public- and private-sector employers, commonly referred to as the payroll survey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo support his claim, Henne referred us to household survey data. Those figures show a decrease of 12,266 employed persons in New Jersey between January 2010 and June 2011, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there&rsquo;s a major problem with Henne&rsquo;s argument: he used the wrong survey to talk about jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe household survey estimates employed persons, while the payroll survey estimates jobs. That&rsquo;s a critical difference, especially since many Garden State residents work in neighboring states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s turn to the job growth estimates from the payroll survey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Christie became governor in January 2010, New Jersey had 3,852,600 non-farm jobs. Based on the payroll survey data publicly available at the time of Henne&rsquo;s statement, New Jersey had 3,859,000 non-farm jobs in May 2011. Both figures were seasonally adjusted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat represents an overall increase of 6,400 non-farm jobs. During that time period, New Jersey was split in terms of job growth on a month-to-month basis -- eight months saw job gains and eight months saw job losses, according to data publicly available at the time of Henne&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey experienced further non-farm job growth in June 2011, but Jay Meisenheimer, an economist with the Bureau of Labor of Statistics, said the job increases in New Jersey can&rsquo;t be characterized in any particular direction. &quot;It just looks like a flat trend,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStanford University economics professor Robert Hall agreed in an email that &quot;the most you could say is that the change is around zero.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that New Jersey&rsquo;s numbers vary between government and private-sector workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBetween January 2010 and May 2011, the number of government employees dropped by 24,700, while private-sector jobs increased by 31,100, according to seasonally adjusted figures publicly available at the time of Henne&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose changes in private-sector employment are &quot;the most appropriate indicator of what is happening in the NJ economy,&quot; according to Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHenne failed to respond to two questions about his use of the household survey to quantify jobs in New Jersey. &quot;We stand by the fact that middle-class and working families took a hit when it comes to jobs. Because it is just that, a fact,&quot; Henne wrote in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we issue our ruling, we should point out that although Henne blamed Christie for job losses, some economists said larger factors include individual job markets and the recession. That&#39;s also despite the fact that Christie often has taken credit for creating private-sector jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;State policy is an element in job creation and destruction, but the overall condition of the job market in the industries in the state is the larger factor,&quot; R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia University Business School, said in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere does all this leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo support his claim that there are &quot;less jobs&quot; since Christie took office in January 2010, Henne cited the wrong set of data. The data used to measure jobs shows a slight increase since Christie became governor, even though some economists said the growth is mainly flat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut New Jersey also has seen an increase in private-sector jobs -- a measure considered by a Rutgers professor to appropriately reflect the state of the economy. Beyond crediting or blaming Christie, economists said other factors include the recession and individual job markets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/politifact_new_jersey_number_o.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-29T16:12:57.562183", "ruling_date": "2011-08-01T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrat-backed One New Jersey claims the state has lost jobs since Gov.
