Rick Scott asked the Legislature to send more money to education during his State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012 -- and he said he&rsquo;s not kidding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education,&quot; Scott said. &quot;And I ask you to please consider that recommendation very carefully. On this point, I just cannot budge. &hellip; This is the single most important decision we can make today for Florida&rsquo;s future.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the $1 billion isn&rsquo;t purely &quot;new&quot; additional funding as Scott said. About $190 million is needed to pay for 30,000 more students expected for next year, and another $220 million goes to make up for a 3 percent drop in property values.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother problem with Scott&rsquo;s claim to support &quot;new&quot; education funding: It doesn&rsquo;t make up for budget cuts that Scott signed into law just last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis hasn&rsquo;t gone unnoticed by Democrats in state government. Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, called Scott&rsquo;s fervor for education funding &quot;new-found.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The bottom line is that we would still be funding education at a level hundreds of millions of dollars less than we did in 2007 if the governor&rsquo;s proposal is passed. It won&rsquo;t make up for the $1.35 billion that the Legislature cut from K-12 education last session,&quot; Rich said in a newsletter to constituents in December.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe went looking for budget documents and news reports on the matter, and we soon confirmed last year&rsquo;s education cuts. We even found evidence of the decline in Scott&rsquo;s own budget documents on his <a href=\"http://letsgettowork.state.fl.us/\">Let&rsquo;s Get to Work</a> website. (See <a href=\"http://letsgettowork.state.fl.us/reports/2012-Budget-Presentation-FY-2012-13.pdf\">page 33 of this chart.</a>)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott&rsquo;s data shows a few interesting trends. Starting with fiscal year 2003, total education funding climbed every year, reaching $18.75 billion in 2007. It then dipped to $17.92 billion in 2008, before climbing again to $18 billion in 2009 and $18.22 billion in 2010, thanks largely to federal economic stimulus funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2011, funding dropped to $16.58 billion, according to interim calculations. Scott&rsquo;s proposal to add state funds would push total funding to $17.15 billion in 2012. As Rich noted, that&rsquo;s still below pre-recession levels.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott is right that he wants to add roughly $1 billion in funding for schools this year, but we think it&rsquo;s disingenuous to call that money &quot;new&quot; -- a descriptor that gives people a distinct impression that education funding is up. Some of that $1 billion in funding is to pay for new students and to close a gap created by lost funding from declining property values. And it doesn&rsquo;t quite make up for the deeper cuts Scott signed off on a year ago. We rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-10T15:28:47.316597", "ruling_date": "2012-01-10T15:54:14", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott says he's adding $1 billion in new education funding", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-says-hes-adding-1-billion-new-education", "ruling_link_text": "Doesn't make up for last year's cuts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGov.
