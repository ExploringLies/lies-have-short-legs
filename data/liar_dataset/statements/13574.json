But let&rsquo;s start with what is the Cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/cabinet\">The Cabinet</a> has 16 members who are in the official line of succession to the presidency -- the vice president, plus the heads of 15 executive departments, such as the secretary of state and the secretary of defense. However, seven more positions &quot;have the status of Cabinet-rank.&quot; They include the White House chief of staff and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Pocan&rsquo;s claim, his office cited <a href=\"http://qz.com/862412/trumps-16-cabinet-level-picks-have-more-money-than-a-third-of-american-households-combined/\">an article</a> posted the day before his radio interview by a website called Quartz, which <a href=\"http://v\">describes itself</a> as a news outlet founded in 2012 &quot;for business people in the new global economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article examined the wealth of 17 Trump selections -- 13 Cabinet members, plus four Cabinet-rank positions. The article said those 17 people have more than $9.5 billion in combined wealth -- &quot;greater than that of the 43 million least wealthy American households combined -- over one-third of the 126 million households total in the U.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That $9.5 billion is roughly in the middle of other estimates on the wealth of the Cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the high end, the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/12/20/trump-cabinet-picks-far-are-worth-combined/XvAJmHCgkHhO3lSxgIKvRM/story.html?fa=lowres\">Boston Globe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-s-cabinet-picks-have-combined-wealth-11b-how-did-n692681\">NBC News</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/donald-trumps-14-billion-cabinet/\">CBS News</a> put their estimates at $13 billion to $14 billion. But that includes $5 billion attributed to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/donald-trumps-14-billion-cabinet/2/\">Todd Ricketts</a>, Trump&rsquo;s pick for deputy commerce secretary, which is not a Cabinet or Cabinet-rank position, and $5 billion for Trump&rsquo;s choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a number that has its own problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the low end of the estimates is $6 billion, from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-trump-cabinet/\">Bloomberg</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg doesn&rsquo;t count Ricketts. And it estimates DeVos&rsquo; net worth as only $130 million, not $5 billion. Both Bloomberg and Forbes point out that the $5 billion is the estimated worth of Richard DeVos, Betsy&rsquo;s father-in-law and the co-founder of Amway, not Betsy DeVos&rsquo; wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other wealthiest Trump Cabinet picks and their estimated net worth, according to Bloomberg: investor Wilbur Ross Jr., the choice for Commerce secretary, $2.9 billion; Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment chief executive officer and Trump&rsquo;s choice for administrator of the Small Business Administration, $1.4 billion; and financier Steve Mnuchin, the choice for Treasury secretary, $655 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One-third of U.S. households</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter, however, whether the net worth of Trump&rsquo;s Cabinet is $6 billion or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because one-third of American households combined -- which includes households with extreme negative net worth -- have essentially no net worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan&rsquo;s claim, said University of California, Berkeley economist <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/\">Emmanuel Saez</a>, director of the school&rsquo;s Center for Equitable Growth, &quot;is a pretty meaningless statement&quot; because &quot;the bottom one-third of American households ranked by wealth own approximately nothing -- some have negative wealth, some have very low wealth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason for gaps in wealth is income inequality. The Urban Institute think tank, using the Federal Reserve Board&#39;s Survey of Consumer Finances data,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/\">found </a>that&nbsp;families near the top had a 70 percent increase in income from 1963 to 2013, while the income of families at the bottom stayed roughly the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the bottom one-third of American households have a combined net worth of negative $50 billion, <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/author/caroline-ratcliffe\">Caroline Ratcliffe</a>, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, told us -- though that is misleading in that it includes relatively few households with extreme negative net worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you exclude those households, the vast majority of households in the bottom third have a net worth of about $3.7 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if Trump&#39;s 17 Cabinet picks have a combined net worth of $6 billion or more, their net worth is greater than the least wealthy one-third of American households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if the bottom one-third actually has a negative net worth, any 17 ordinary Americans who have a net worth of at least $1 would have a higher net worth than one-third of Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan says Trump&#39;s first 17 Cabinet appointments &quot;have a net worth of more than a third of America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One-third of American households have a combined net worth of roughly zero. So, the combined net worth of Trump Cabinet members is greater, but so is that of any American who has a net worth of more than zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a023f85-18f0-46c6-afaf-51178c79b199\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a023f85-18f0-46c6-afaf-51178c79b199</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Recent fact checks on wealth</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;</strong>While campaigning in Madison for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a>, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bernie-s/\">Bernie Sanders</a> claimed Trump&rsquo;s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walmart Walton family would &quot;get a $53 billion tax break.&quot; Our rating was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/17/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-donald-trump-plan-end-estate-t/\">Half True</a>. Based on the collective wealth of seven Sam Walton descendants, they could face a tax of about $53 billion under the current estate tax law, but there were other factors to take into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&rarr;&nbsp;</strong>Previously, while still challenging Clinton for the nomination, Sanders said in Madison that &quot;the top one-tenth of 1 percent&quot; of Americans &quot;own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.&quot; That merited a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-madison-claims-top-01-americans-hav/\">Mostly True</a>.
