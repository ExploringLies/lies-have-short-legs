The same goes for Minnesota residents attending college in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe difference is significant. At the University of Minnesota, for example, in-state tuition in 2011-2012 is $13,062 and out-of-state tuition is $5,000 more, <a href=\"http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/sPagesGR/TuitionChart.cfm?State=MN&amp;pageID=101&amp;1534-D83A_1933715A=c0700edac513e475b0878184e92e734ef962ae20\">figures</a> from the Minnesota Office of Higher Education show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the annual renewal of the reciprocity agreement was announced on Aug. 15, 2011, an <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/127765668.html\">article</a> on JSOnline.com, the website of the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>, carried this headline: &quot;Wisconsin students to pay more under new tuition pact with Minnesota.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe additional cost would be about $1,400 more each year for Wisconsin residents attending the University of Minnesota and about $2,200 for those attending the University of Minnesota-Duluth, the article said. The amounts vary at other campuses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in a <a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=177&amp;prid=5965\">news </a><a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=177&amp;prid=5965\">release</a> issued the same day, Gov. Scott Walker said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This new tuition reciprocity agreement with the State of Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents. Smaller tuition bills widen access to higher education, and that&rsquo;s a win-win situation for students and Wisconsin.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWait. More affordable even as you pay more?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSounds like the new math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s hit the books.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince 1965, Wisconsin has had a tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota in one form or another, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/Section1310/2011_05_24_JFC_HEAB.pdf\">according</a> to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It&rsquo;s the only reciprocity agreement that allows Wisconsin residents to attend public universities outside of Wisconsin and pay the lower in-state tuition rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther reciprocity agreements relate to community and technical colleges in Michigan, Illinois and Iowa, <a href=\"http://heab.state.wi.us/programs.html#reciprocity\">according</a> to the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause tuition in Minnesota is generally higher, the reciprocity agreement was amended in 2007 so that Wisconsin would make supplementary payments to Minnesota schools, according to the state fiscal bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s an example of how the supplementary payment worked in the 2010-2011 school year:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo schools considered comparable under the reciprocity agreement are the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Minnesota, where nearly half of the Wisconsin reciprocity students studying in Minnesota attend school.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010-2011, tuition was $9,794 at the Twin Cities campus and $8,398 at UW-Madison, a difference of $1,396.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota had to pay only the $8,398; that meant the University of Minnesota was receiving $1,396 less than it received from a Minnesota resident. Through the supplementary payment, the State of Wisconsin paid the difference of $1,396 to the University of Minnesota.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the new reciprocity agreement, the supplementary payments to Minnesota schools are eliminated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means Wisconsin residents, starting with freshmen entering college in 2012-2013, will have to pay the full in-state tuition to attend school in Minnesota. Had the supplements been eliminated in 2010-2011, a Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota would have had to pay $1,396 more in tuition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe move is expected to save Wisconsin $2.6 million in 2012-2013 and more in subsequent years, according to the fiscal bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn announcing the new reciprocity agreement, Walker said more than 10,000 Wisconsin students participate in the program every year. But his news release didn&rsquo;t explain his quote about how the new deal makes college more affordable for Wisconsin residents, so we asked his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, for evidence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWerwie didn&rsquo;t have any. He simply pointed out that, if there were no reciprocity agreement, Wisconsin residents would have to pay the higher out-of-state tuition rate to attend school in Minnesota. But that goes without saying.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, the idea of tuition reciprocity is not new. An agreement has been in place since before Walker was born.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s go to the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker said the new tuition reciprocity agreement between Wisconsin and Minnesota makes college &quot;more affordable for Wisconsin residents.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the new agreement doesn&rsquo;t make attending school in Minnesota any more affordable. In fact, it&rsquo;s just the opposite. By eliminating supplementary payments from the state, the typical reciprocity student from Wisconsin will have to pay $1,400 more in tuition each year, based on 2010-2011 figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s statement grades out as Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-01T11:56:01.166762", "ruling_date": "2011-09-04T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Gov.
