The decrease was small -- less than 1 percent cumulatively over the five-year period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut this is only one of the ways to look at the question. In fact, analyzing Massachusetts budget questions is a particularly thorny task.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, determining the proper time frame for judging Romney&rsquo;s tenure is tricky, since the governor&rsquo;s term doesn&rsquo;t line up precisely with the state&rsquo;s fiscal year. Romney would have had no influence on the 2002 budget, but he would have had responsibility (along with the Legislature) for the second half of the 2003 budget, as well as authority (again, with the Legislature) for 2004, 2005 and 2006, and, finally, for the first half of the 2007 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked budget experts which time frame would be most appropriate, but there was no consensus. We&rsquo;ll look at two time spans below.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center offers two methods for adjusting by inflation -- one for prices of items typically purchased by governments (the one used by American Bridge) and one adjusted for consumer prices overall. We&rsquo;ll look at both.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd third, the category American Bridge used -- &nbsp;&quot;law and public safety&quot; -- isn&rsquo;t the only one available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeneath that heading on the budget tool are sub-categories more narrowly targeted toward public safety, including, &quot;law enforcement,&quot; &quot;prisons, probation and parole,&quot; and &quot;prosecutors.&quot; Combining these three categories into one measurement avoids lumping in court operations, many of which stem from civil actions rather than criminal cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, another line item that sheds some light is &quot;local aid,&quot; since many public safety activities in Massachusetts are paid for by localities, partly using revenues handed down from the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow let&rsquo;s look at various combinations of these calculations:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em><strong>Combination of &quot;law enforcement,&quot; &quot;prisons, probation and parole,&quot; and &quot;prosecutors,&quot; adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement</strong>:</em><br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 5 percent increase<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 8 percent increase<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em><strong>Combination of &quot;law enforcement,&quot; &quot;prisons, probation and parole,&quot; and &quot;prosecutors,&quot; adjusted by overall inflation</strong>:</em><br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 15 percent increase<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 17 percent increase<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, using these figures, Romney&rsquo;s record actually shows an increase beyond inflation, not a decrease.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em><strong>Local aid, adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement</strong></em>:<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 17 percent decrease<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 3 percent decrease<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em><strong>Local aid, adjusted by overall inflation</strong></em>:<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 9 percent decrease<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007</strong>: 6 percent increase<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney did cut local aid below the rate of inflation in three out of the four calculations we did. However, local aid is a less precise measurement, since it is allocated in a variety of ways, not just for public safety. Also, because local officials would have a say in how much to fund their own law-enforcement departments, Romney wouldn&rsquo;t be solely to blame for local law-enforcement cuts made during his tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we should note that a Democrat, Deval Patrick, followed Romney as governor, and his record has been one of contracting spending compared to inflation. Between 2007 and 2012, the combination of &quot;law enforcement,&quot; &quot;prisons, probation and parole,&quot; and &quot;prosecutors,&quot; adjusted for government inflation, plunged by a whopping 17 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are ways to fiddle with the numbers so that spending on &quot;public safety&quot; declined compared to inflation while Romney was governor. But there are more ways, and we think more credible ways, to calculate it that show spending increases on Romney&rsquo;s watch. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-12T11:26:28.905430", "ruling_date": "2012-06-12T17:07:33", "ruling_headline": "Democratic SuperPAC ad blasts Romney record on funding law enforcement", "ruling_headline_slug": "democratic-superpac-ad-blasts-romney-record-fundin", "ruling_link_text": "Most calculations show an increase", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmerican Bridge 21st Century, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSwtSHfjOkw&amp;feature=plcp\">Officer Romney&#39;s Record</a>&quot; (ad), June 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Memo, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nationalmemo.com/did-young-mitt-romney-impersonate-a-police-officer-another-witness-says-yes/\">Did Young Mitt Romney Impersonate A Police Officer?
