Hayne is worth $1.1 billion, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-hayne/\">according to Forbes.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFriends here in Florida who saw the Facebook post asked us to look into the connection between Hayne and Santorum, the former Republican U.S. senator who is running for president.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHayne is from Philadelphia and attended Lehigh University near Allentown.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum was elected to the U.S. House to represent a western Pennsylvania district in 1990, then was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994, where he served two terms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The campaign donations</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHayne has not contributed to Santorum&rsquo;s presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tabulates campaign contributions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Hayne and his wife Margaret have contributed to Santorum and his political action committee in the past.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom 1994-2005 the Haynes contributed $13,900 to Santorum or a PAC he started, Fight-PAC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMargaret Hayne donated $2,400 to Santorum directly and $5,000 to his political committee. Her donations came in 1997 and 1998.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRichard Hayne gave $3,500 to Santorum and $3,000 to Fight-PAC. Hayne&rsquo;s first donation was in October 1994; his last contribution was recorded in May 2005.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe donations ended when Santorum lost his Senate seat in 2006 to Democrat Bob Casey Jr.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Haynes, over time, also have contributed to former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican political committee and more recently to Joseph Torsella, a Democrat who briefly ran for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, and Republican Rep. Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Hayne&rsquo;s political stances</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe record on Hayne&rsquo;s personal and political beliefs is less clear. For his part, Hayne has tried to avoid the topic. (Santorum is a known opponent of abortion and gay marriage.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a profile in <em><a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/clothes_make_the_man-38368134.html\">Philadelphia Weekly</a> </em>from 2003, Hayne was asked about his support for Santorum. He at first denied contributing to Santorum, according to the article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked to clarify after being shown proof of his contributions, Hayne said: &quot;I don&#39;t want to mislead you. Like many people, I have some affinity for Rick Santorum, and I have problems with some of his positions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe author of the article, Jonathan Valania, then asked where does Santorum&#39;s position on homosexuality (Santorum opposes same-sex marriage and has suggested homosexual sex should be illegal) fit in Hayne&rsquo;s comfort zone?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m not going to comment on it,&quot; the magazine quoted Hayne as saying. &quot;I have my own opinion, but I am not going to share it. Our job as a business is not to promote a political agenda. That&#39;s not what we do. There are all kinds of political views held by my employees. Some would be horrified to learn that we contributed to Santorum&#39;s campaign, and others would be fine with it. We openly discuss and joke about our political differences.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a 2007 interview with <em>Philadelphia Magazine</em>, Hayne explained the contributions and support of Santorum this way: &quot;I don&#39;t like paying taxes -- is that a sin?&quot; he asks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I like small government,&quot; Hayne said, explaining a libertarian streak.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe company, for the record, has not commented on this latest kerfuffle or a similar uproar started in 2011 by a <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5806486/miley-cyrus-hates-urban-outfitters-rick-santorum\">tweet from pop-star Miley Cyrus.</a> <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/hayne.asp\">Snopes.com</a> failed to turn up anything additional on Hayne&rsquo;s political positions, though they do a fine job in explaining the rest of the Facebook post if you&rsquo;re looking to read more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re focusing here on the Facebook claim that Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne is a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat we know is that Hayne was at one time a supporter of Santorum, who donated -- between him and his wife -- more than $13,000 to Santorum and one of his political action committees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHayne has not contributed to Santorum&rsquo;s run for president, and we do not know if Hayne is supporting Santorum this time around. That, combined with the fact that the donations are nearly 7-18 years old, is enough for us to rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-04T10:20:16.562576", "ruling_date": "2012-04-04T11:32:37", "ruling_headline": "Facebook post claims Urban Outfitters CEO backs Santorum", "ruling_headline_slug": "facebook-post-claims-urban-outfitters-ceo-backs-sa", "ruling_link_text": "Contributions were years ago", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151453177505602&amp;set=p.10151453177505602&amp;type=1&amp;theater\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.631792860988996\">Facebook post about Richard Hayne</a>, accessed April 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.urbn.com/\">Urban Outfitters Inc.</a>, corporate Website, accessed April 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t2012 <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-hayne/\">&nbsp;Forbes</a> profile of Richard Hayne, updated March 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=Hayne&amp;state=PA&amp;zip=19118&amp;employ=&amp;cand=&amp;old=Y&amp;sort=N&amp;capcode=v5mg9&amp;submit=Submit+your+Donor+Query\">donor look-up</a>, accessed April 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhiladelphia Weekly, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/clothes_make_the_man-38368134.html\">Clothes Make the Man</a>,&quot; June 11, 2003<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhiladelphia Magazine, &quot;Shop Talk,&quot; April 2007, accessed via Nexis<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSnopes.com, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/hayne.asp\">Richard Hayne</a>, March 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGawker, &quot;<a href=\"http://gawker.com/5806486/miley-cyrus-hates-urban-outfitters-rick-santorum\">Miley Cyrus Hates Urban Outfitters, Rick Santorum</a>,&quot; March 28, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 14, "current_job": "Social media posting", "false_count": 18, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 1486, "last_name": "Facebook posts", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "facebook-posts", "pants_count": 37, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Facebook_icon_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1486/", "total_count": 101, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Richard Hayne, president and CEO of Urban Outfitters &hellip; (is) a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a post on Facebook", "statement_date": "2012-04-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 119, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/119/", "subject": "Families", "subject_slug": "families", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 52, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/52/", "subject": "Pop Culture", "subject_slug": "pop-culture", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
