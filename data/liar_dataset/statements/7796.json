So we took a look and found that McAuliffe&rsquo;s had merged figures from two databases that measure different things.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s consider McAuliffe&rsquo;s numbers as a fraction. The numerator, or number on top, is 53,000. The denominator, or number on the bottom, is 98,000.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s look at the numerator. Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the campaign got the number of 53,000 teachers older than 50 from the Virginia Retirement System, which manages the public school pensions of all full-time instructors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut there&rsquo;s a problem with this number. VRS spokeswoman Jeanne Chenault told us that tally represents not just teachers over 50, but all of the full-time &quot;professional or clerical employees&quot; &nbsp;of school divisions across the state who have crossed that age threshold -- including administrators, counselors and secretaries. The VRS does not have age data for just teachers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChenault said school employment numbers fluctuate and that the most current data, from June 2012, show 56,328 full time workers were 50 or older.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s look at the denominator. Schwerin sent us a slide from a state Department of Education presentation that said during 2010-11 school year, Virginia schools had an instructional staff of about 98,792. But this is the wrong figure to use.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe correct denominator is 147,216 --which is the number of all full time public school employees at the end of last June.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo, if McAuliffe is to rely on VRS information, the most he can say is that at the end of last school year, 56,328 of the 147,216 full time public school employees -- or 38.3 percent -- were 50 or older.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a far cry from McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim that more than half of the teachers had crossed 50.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe can drill to a more accurate estimate of the number of teachers who have lived a half century. Virginia&rsquo;s Department of Education kept age data on the instructional staff at public schools -- teachers, librarians, guidance counselors and technology instructors -- through the 2010-11 school year. It no longer keeps those records.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe same DOE slide presentation cited by McAuliffe&rsquo;s campaign that shows the instructional staff at 98,792 at the end of the 2011 school year also says, on a different slide, that 33,462 of them were 50 or older. That breaks down to 33.9 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe state government&rsquo;s workforce, by comparison, is older. VRS data from last year -- which does not include state troopers and other law enforcement officers, judges and college faculty -- shows that of 76,274 state bureaucrats, 37,290 were 50 or older. That&rsquo;s 48.9 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s also consider the national workforce. According to the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat03.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, there was an average of 133.6 million full and part-time workers in the U.S. last year who were at least 20. Of them, 48.3 million were at least 50. That&rsquo;s 36.2 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe should note that there has been some aging in nation&rsquo;s teaching corps, as pointed out in a 2010 <a href=\"http://nctaf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/NCTAF-Who-Will-Teach-Experience-Matters-2010-Report.pdf\">report</a>by the National Commission on Teaching and America&rsquo;s Future. It said many Baby Boomers chose classroom careers in the 1960&rsquo;s and &lsquo;70&rsquo;s, making the average age of teachers 36, &quot;one of the youngest teaching forces in history.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut by 2004, those Baby Boomers, who were still the majority, had aged and the national average was pushed to 42.5, &quot;older than it had been in more than half a century.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe average retirement age for teachers is 59, the report said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;We can expect to lose as many as a million and a half veteran teachers to retirement during the next eight years,&quot; the report said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe turnover of teachers is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. &quot;Policymakers want to keep great teachers in the classroom for as long as they can and encourage new, young talent into the profession,&quot; Emily Workman, an associate policy analyst for the Education Commission of the States, wrote to us in an email.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-6607529a-b361-89c2-f81a-7913d0543f6a\">Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe said, &quot;Of our 98,000 teachers who are K-12, over 53,000 of those teachers today are over 50 years old.&quot; But he is mixing statistics that don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t go together and his eye-popping claim that more than half of Virginia&rsquo;s teachers have lived more than half a century doesn&rsquo;t hold up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginia does not keep data that is solely focused on the age of teachers. The best statistics available show that the state&rsquo;s instructional staff -- including teachers, librarians, guidance counselors and technology instructors -- was 98,792 during the 2010-11 school year and, of them, 33,462 were 50 or older. That&rsquo;s 33.9 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe teaching corps is not moving toward retirement with anything close to the speed that McAuliffe described.
