We wondered if Patterson was sparking on  extra cylinders.</p>\r\n<p>Responding, Patterson said that since the state  started leasing the rights to erect wind turbines in about 163,000 acres  of Gulf waters in 2005, two companies have paid in the cited money in  bonus royalties and delay rentals even though no wind turbines have been  built.</p>\r\n<p>Land office spokesman Jim Suydam said the total, paid to  the state since January 2005, also reflects nomination fees, application  fees and interest earned on the collected money. Suydam said nomination  fees are what someone pays to nominate a tract of state land for an  energy lease. The state then puts the tract up for bid, with the high  bidder winning the lease. Rental or bonus payments are the amount  someone pays (as determined by their lease with the state) to lease the  tract of land for a period of time. Application fees are what they pay  to apply for the lease.</p>\r\n<p>The agency shared a breakdown showing  $44,117 of the total Patterson touts came from leaseholders of acreage  on land where turbines have not yet been built. That makes the total  income from Gulf leases $407,815.</p>\r\n<p>We nudged Patterson about  saying he \"earned the school children of Texas money&rdquo; -- does he mean  kids are getting checks from the state?</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo;  Patterson said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody would believe I meant the school  children get a check.&rdquo; (Indeed, land commissioners traditionally mention  the \"schoolchildren of Texas\" in connection with proceeds from  state-owned lands; it's hallowed parlance.)</p>\r\n<p>Patterson said the  described proceeds&mdash;like mineral royalties from state lands&mdash;went instead  to the Permanent School Fund, the state's public education endowment,  which had a $22.6 billion balance as of the end of August. The State  Board of Education receives a share of earnings from the fund for  distribution to school districts on a per-student basis. Also, districts  use the fund to back bonds for capital projects, according to the  endowment's 2009 annual report.</p>\r\n<p>We rate Patterson&rsquo;s statement as  True.<br /><br /><br /></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-29T15:04:39.269165", "ruling_date": "2010-04-30T17:42:14", "ruling_headline": "Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson says wind leases have earned nearly $500,000 despite delayed electricity production", "ruling_headline_slug": "land-commissioner-jerry-patterson-says-wind-leases", "ruling_link_text": "He's not whistling in the wind", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Jerry Patterson, Texas  land commissioner, April 27, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Jerry Patterson, Texas land  commissioner, opinion column, Austin American-Statesman, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/opinion/patterson-future-is-in-green-energy-626480.html\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Patterson:   Future is in green energy,&rdquo;</a> April 27, 2010 (accessed April 27,  2010)</p>\r\n<p>Texas Education Agency, Texas Permanent School Fund, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/120109_psf2009annualreport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Annual   Report, Fiscal 2009</a>, December 2009</p>\r\n<p>Texas General Land  Office, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04272010_glochartwindrevenue.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Renewable   Energy Lease Revenue, Non-Producing Wind Leases,&rdquo; Revenue Received  Between 1/1/2005 and 4/16/2010</a>, received April 27, 2010<br /> <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04272010_landofficeresponses.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04272010_landofficeresponses.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail   excerpts</a> and interviews, Jim Suydam, press secretary, Texas General  Land Office, responses to W.
