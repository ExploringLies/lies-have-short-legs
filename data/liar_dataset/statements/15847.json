He claimed Cox, a San Diego businessman who Trump has endorsed, has &quot;parroted&quot; Trump on the president&rsquo;s controversial family separation policy for those who illegally cross the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom made the assertion immediately after discussing Cox&rsquo;s policies, implying that his Republican rival fully supports separating immigrant families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Even by relatively moderate positions in the Republican party in California, he&rsquo;s on the extreme of those positions,&quot; Newsom <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7R8jx6azLk\">told ABC7</a> in Los Angeles on Aug. 17, 2018. &quot;He can&rsquo;t run away from Trump.

Thousands of children were taken from their parents and sent to detention centers this spring after their families crossed the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Trump eventually ended the policy, hundreds of children remain separated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/10/politics/trump-immigration-family-separation-solution/index.html\">claimed</a> the problem could be solved if people &quot;Don&#39;t come to our country illegally.

Cox has repeatedly stated he opposes the policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox and Trump have both said Congress should solve the issue, offering one parallel between the two. But even on this point, they&rsquo;re not in lock-step. Trump has falsely blamed Democrats in Congress for forcing the separations, while Cox hasn&rsquo;t made that specific charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If anything, Cox has &quot;parroted&quot; one of Trump&rsquo;s talking points about who should solve the problem.
