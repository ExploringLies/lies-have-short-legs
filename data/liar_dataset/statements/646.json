Joseph Biden, April 29, 2007, NBC's\n <i>\n  Meet the Press\n </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n <i>\n  \"I am not interested in the vice presidency.\"\n </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n - Biden, June 22, 2008, NBC's\n <i>\n  Meet the Press\n </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n Well, on Aug. 23, there was Biden in Illinois standing next to Sen. Barack Obama &ndash; his brand new running mate.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"President Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place, then stand firm,\" Biden said. \"Today in Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place. And I'm proud to stand firm with the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama!\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Look, we realize there's a sort of ritual dance that goes on when politicians are put in the awkward spot of being asked if they want to be picked as a vice presidential running mate. Rare is the politician who says, \"Heck yeah, I've even lobbied for it.\" That smells of desperation and seems a recipe for future embarrassment. More often, potential vice presidential short-listers demur, or say the question is too hypothetical or that it's just plain moot because they aren't going to be asked anyway. Some avoid the query altogether, saying it's a question for the presidential candidate. And then there's Biden's route, the I'm-not-interested route. Never mind that few actually believed him &ndash; we all know the drill.\n</p>\n<p>\n And to be fair, let's put the earlier quotes in some context.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first, \"I will not be vice president under any circumstances,\" came when Biden was still a presidential candidate himself. You don't concede interest in the No. 2 job when you're still in the hunt for the No. 1 job.\n</p>\n<p>\n But Biden was long out of the presidential race when NBC's Brian Williams asked him on\n <i>\n  Meet the Press\n </i>\n on June 22, 2008,  \"Are you interested in the vice presidency?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I am not interested in the vice presidency,\" Biden said.\n</p>\n<p>\n Williams asked again, \"You are not interested in the vice presidency?\"\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I'm not interested,\" Biden repeated.\n</p>\n<p>\n But Williams, who knows the game, then asked if Biden would say yes if asked.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"Unlike most other people, I'm being straight with you,\" Biden said. \"If asked, I will do it. I've made it clear I...do...not...want...to...be...asked.\" He pounded his hand on the desk with each word for emphasis.\n</p>\n<p>\n Williams summarized, \"Do not want to be asked but, if asked, the answer, of course, would be yes.\"\r\n\"Of course,\" Biden said, \"it would, because the &ndash; if the presidential nominee thought I could help him win, I'm going to say to the first African-American candidate about to make history in the world that, 'No, I will not help you out like you want me to?' Of course, I'll say yes.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n So the question here, were Biden's earlier pronouncements a flip-flop? Yes, given Biden's adamant tone. We realize his remarks were part of this well-known dance, but when you pound the table to emphasize your position, you tip the scale to a Full Flop.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:05.860121", "ruling_date": "2008-08-24T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "He seems interested", "ruling_headline_slug": "he-seems-interested", "ruling_link_text": "He seems interested", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "MSNBC,\n<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25313596/page/4/\">\n Transcript: Meet the Press,\n</a>\nJune 22, 2008\n<p>\n MSNBC,\n <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18381961/page/6/\">\n  Transcript: Meet the Press,\n </a>\n April 29, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n CNN,\n <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0808/23/cnr.06.html\">\n  Transcript: Obama and Biden Speak in Illinois,\n </a>\n Aug. 23, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 10, "first_name": "Joe", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Delaware", "id": 11, "last_name": "Biden", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "joe-biden", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-joebiden.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/11/", "total_count": 78, "true_count": 13, "website": "http://www.joebiden.com/"}, "statement": "On whether he wants to be vice president.", "statement_context": "", "statement_date": "2008-08-24", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
