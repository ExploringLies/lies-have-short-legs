(If she had, it's reasonable to conclude it would have hampered her fundraising, which netted $151,000 from the securities and investment sector in the past two years.)\n</p>\n<p>\n A more recent version, forwarded numerous times to PolitiFact from readers imploring us to check it out, shares the same thrust, though it is in a class by itself when it comes to misplaced capital letters.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;Nancy Pelosi wants a Windfall Tax on Retirement Income,&quot; it says. &quot;Madam speaker [where's that shift key when you need it?] Nancy Pelosi wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits, including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds! Alas, it is true &mdash; all to help the 12 Million Illegal Immigrants and other unemployed Minorities!&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;Send it on to your friends,&quot; the e-mail concludes. &quot;I just did!! This lady is out of her mind.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n Pelosi's office is well-practiced at responding to inquiries about this hoax, and did so with a prepared letter from the speaker:\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;Internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated,&quot; Pelosi's letter says. &quot;In addition, my record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n The Democratic presidential candidates kicked around the idea of a windfall tax on oil companies, and Democrats support the idea of raising the capital gains tax rate somewhat. But there simply is not a shred of proof in the public record that Pelosi has ever advocated anything even remotely like the windfall tax described in these e-mails.\n</p>\n<p>\n In her letter she provided links to two other fact-checkers who have debunked these e-mails, Snopes.com and Truthorfiction.com. She might consider adding FactCheck.org &mdash; they took on this hoax on Jan. 14, 2009.\n</p>\n<p>\n And by all means, feel free to add us to the list.
