In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America&rsquo;s 50 largest cities. That&rsquo;s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation&rsquo;s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. There were thousands of shootings in Chicago last year alone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll fact-check this portion of that statement: &quot;In our nation&rsquo;s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.&quot; The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to <a href=\"https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/district-crime-data-glance\">data from the Metropolitan Police Department</a>, the Washington, D.C., police force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, there were 105 homicides in D.C. The following year -- 2015 -- there were 162. That&rsquo;s an increase of 54 percent -- and that&rsquo;s in line with what the White House website said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the story doesn&rsquo;t end there. There is already city-level data for homicides in 2016, and the release of that data painted a different picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure for 2016 was 135 homicides. That&rsquo;s <em>down </em>17 percent from the previous year -- not up roughly 50 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 2015, Washington, D.C., as well as many other large cities, saw a significant increase in homicides,&quot; said Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Margarita A. Mikhaylova. But Washington, D.C., &quot;has been able to notably reduce the homicide rate in 2016.&quot; She cited &quot;a concerted focus on removing illegal firearms from the streets, preventing robberies, and especially, continuing to build trust with the communities we serve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mikhaylova added that violent crime overall -- which includes homicides, sex crimes, assaults with a dangerous weapon, and robbery -- fell by 10 percent in Washington, D.C., between 2015 and 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the trend a little further back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So, over the previous two decades, the number of homicides in Washington, D.C., has tumbled -- it&rsquo;s 55 percent lower than 20 years earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the number of homicides has risen by 53 percent since it hit its lowest level in 2012. In theory, that statistic can be used to bolster Trump&rsquo;s claim. However, using the low year of 2012 as the baseline amounts to cherry picking. Both the longer-term trend (20 years) and the most recent year-over-year figure are down, rather than up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump White House website said, &quot;In our nation&rsquo;s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That statistic would have been correct prior to the release of the most recent annual statistics by the Metropolitan Police Department. However, the most recent figures, from 2016, show a 17 percent decline in homicides from 2015. In addition, the long-term trend shows significantly lower numbers for homicides in Washington, D.C., than was the rule for the 1990s -- even if you compare the spike of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\">\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\r\n<div><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/\">Politifact</a></div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-mostlyfalse.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">3</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">6</div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-mostlyfalse.jpg\" style=\"display:none\" /> Politifact Rating:\r\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\">&quot;In our nation&rsquo;s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Donald Trump</div>\r\n\r\n<div>president</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<img src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg\" style=\"display:none\" />\r\n<div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\">in a statement on the White House website</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Friday, January 20, 2017</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">-01/-20/2017</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/23/donald-trump/white-house-website-says-dc-homicides-climbed-50-p/\">Read More</a>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right\"><a href=\"#\">info</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-23T16:52:45.109477", "ruling_date": "2017-01-23T17:51:26", "ruling_headline": "White House website says D.C. homicides climbed 50 percent, but more recent data shows they fell", "ruling_headline_slug": "white-house-website-says-dc-homicides-climbed-50-p", "ruling_link_text": "Most recent data shows a decline", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House website, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/law-enforcement-community\">Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community</a>,&quot; accessed Jan 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metropolitan Police Department, &quot;<a href=\"https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/district-crime-data-glance\">District Crime Data at a Glance</a>,&quot; accessed Jan 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Margarita A.
