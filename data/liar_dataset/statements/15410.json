We have a real plan to make it happen. But I&rsquo;m going to also make sure that we&rsquo;re not taking any kid out of a productive learning environment until that school in their neighborhood is the best choice. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I want to put it in just stark terms here, because I did speak to parents all throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee. And I&rsquo;ll give it to you in just blank terms here. Black families are sick of white people telling them where to send their kids to school; that&rsquo;s just the reality. So I am going to be a governor that&rsquo;s going to fight for every kid. We have lost generations -- &nbsp;generations of children -- and we&rsquo;re not losing another generation on my watch.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, in the context of choice schools in the city, Gronik says he &quot;did speak to parents throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee.&quot; And the neighborhoods that he refers to as having &quot;lost generations&quot; of children are in Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not his neighborhood in Fox Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lived here&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few minutes later, responding to a question about supporting unions for teachers, Gronik again gave the impression he lives in the city, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We need to make sure that we restore teachers&rsquo; voices in that classroom, (that) we spend more one-on-one time with those kids, that we have the resources to help kids that are at-risk; that before we lose another generation of children in my neighborhood, too -- I&rsquo;ve lived here all 61 years of my life. And I&rsquo;ve watched what&rsquo;s happened with kids throughout these neighborhoods, our neighborhoods, kids that do not have the kind of bright future that they should have. It&rsquo;s a huge reason I&rsquo;m here.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, Gronik&rsquo;s reference to a lost generation, and to kids lacking a bright future, is to kids in the city, not &quot;in my neighborhood&quot; in Fox Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Latest Gronik fact checks:</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t&quot;Black Americans still earn less than 73 percent of what white men make.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/04/andy-gronik/do-black-workers-earn-73-what-their-white-counterp/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Wisconsin &#39;guaranteeing&#39; nearly $3 billion to Foxconn with no job guarantees. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/12/andy-gronik/wisconsin-guaranteeing-nearly-3-billion-foxconn-no/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Scott Walker &quot;has taken money away from internet expansion in our state.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/10/andy-gronik/testing-democratic-challenger-claim-scott-walker-t/\">Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>His explanation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gronik promptly called us when we told his campaign spokesman that we would be fact checking his claim that he&rsquo;s lived in Milwaukee his whole life. He started off by acknowledging that he grew up in Glendale, another Milwaukee County suburb, and lives in Fox Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gronik also told us:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> &quot;As you well know, when I plug in my ZIP code (53217), it says Milwaukee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you run a Google search of Gronik&rsquo;s street address, depending on the website you choose, some responses show Fox Point while others show Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Gronik lives in Fox Point, not Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> &quot;I consider Milwaukee to be my hometown. I&rsquo;m not trying to suggest that I grew up other than where I grew up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gronik is trying to have it both ways -- saying he&rsquo;s from Milwaukee, but not denying that he grew up in a suburb (and now lives in another suburb).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. </strong>&quot;I&rsquo;ve never made any bones about the fact that I live in Fox Point. I really think that you&rsquo;re splitting hairs. I am in no way, shape or form misleading anybody as to my address. But I do consider everyone in Milwaukee County to be part of my community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Gronik were asked in an airport in Atlanta where he lives, saying Milwaukee would be fine; most people have not heard of Fox Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in speaking to Milwaukee teachers about Milwaukee schools, to say you&rsquo;re from the city when you really live in a high-income suburb, is misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gronik told an audience made up largely of Milwaukee teachers at an education forum in Milwaukee: &quot;I&rsquo;ve lived here (in Milwaukee) all 61 years of my life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gronik acknowledged to us that he grew up in one Milwaukee suburb, Glendale, and now lives in another, upscale Fox Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Milwaukee&quot; as sort of a blanket term for the city and its close-in suburbs is not entirely wrong.
