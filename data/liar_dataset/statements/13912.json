The site operators <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/author/eagle/\">describe themselves</a> as &quot;a group of educated, God-fearing Christian conservative patriots.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline and article were also <a href=\"http://usanewspost.us/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/\">posted the same day</a> on a site called usanewspost.us, which presents an overlay of photos of scantily clad women when you go to its home page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not on any other site that we could find -- much less a reputable news source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aside, before we dig in: Roughly two-thirds of the statements made <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/blog-posting/\">by bloggers</a> that have been rated by PolitiFact have received a False or Pants on Fire. That includes <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/23/blog-posting/snoop-dogg-wasnt-arrested-over-comments-about-shoo/\">a handful</a> made by TheLastLineOfDefense.org.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its site carries <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/about-us/\">a disclaimer</a> that says its articles &quot;may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don&rsquo;t necessarily exist.

The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming (sic) loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any connection between Trump&rsquo;s White House and any person with that name or anything called WHOIP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article, which doesn&rsquo;t spell out what precipitated Trump&rsquo;s alleged statement, ends by stating that Trump approached Ryan at a luncheon and told him: &quot;Mr. Speaker, you&rsquo;re fired.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It goes without saying that if Trump had had such an encounter with Ryan, it would have been widely reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One operator of&nbsp;TheLastLineOfDefense.org responded to our request for information to back up the statement by referring us to the site&#39;s disclaimer notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2017, BuzzFeed News <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/a-hoax-about-trump-removing-islamic-symbols-from-the-white-h?utm_term=.yxV12Bp9G#.gdgYyqlRW\">reported</a> that according to that man, identified as Zeke Wilekenmeyer, the site is &quot;an elaborate trolling operation aimed at conservatives.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan press secretary Ian Martorana told us: &quot;That headline is pure fiction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers said: &quot;President Trump just told Paul Ryan, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re fired.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No such statement has ever surfaced in the mainstream news media, only on a website that warns that much of its material is satirical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating is Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-28T13:01:54.750775", "ruling_date": "2017-04-02T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump didn't use 'The Celebrity Apprentice' catchphrase 'You're fired' on Paul Ryan", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-didnt-use-celebrity-apprentice-catchp", "ruling_link_text": "Fake firing = fake news", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>LastLineOfDefense.org, <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trump-just-told-paul-ryan-youre-fired/\">&quot;BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan &lsquo;You&rsquo;re Fired,&rsquo;&quot;</a> March 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Paul Ryan press secretary Ian Martorana, March 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Email, Zeke Wilekenmeyer of TheLastLineOfDefense.org, March 28, 2017</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;President Trump just told Paul Ryan, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re fired.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an article", "statement_date": "2017-03-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
