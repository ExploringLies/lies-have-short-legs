Oil companies would bid for the leases and then build drilling rigs at the sites.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe measure won virtually unanimous support from Republicans, as well as votes from 33 Democrats. But Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, opposed the measure and criticized it in a press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoran said the bill was about &quot;currying favor&quot; with the oil industry, not cutting energy prices. He &nbsp;said drilling off the Virginia coast could interfere with Navy training operations. Furthermore, Moran said, &quot;American oil production is at its highest level since 2003.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if America&rsquo;s oil wells are really pumping their highest output in eight years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, is the clearinghouse for U.S. and global data on oil production and consumption. According to EIA data, the U.S. produced 5.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2010, up from 5.4 million barrels per day in 2009. That is indeed the highest number since 2003, when production was 5.7 million barrels per day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s interesting to note that U.S. production for the past decade has been below 6 million barrels a day. In the 1970s, production ranged from 8.1 million to 9.6 million barrels a day. And through most of the 1980s, it was above 8 million barrels a day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn March, after President Barack Obama made the same claim as Moran, PolitiFact&rsquo;s national staff <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-last-year-was-/\">reviewed the statement</a>.

But an updated May energy outlook projected a decline of only 20,000 barrels per day, followed by an additional 60,000 barrels per day decline in 2012. The agency said the reductions would come largely in Alaska, due to maturing oil fields, and the Gulf of Mexico. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you&rsquo;re curious, U.S. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/05/gerry-connolly/gerry-connolly-says-us-owns-3-percent-worlds-oil-c/\">demand</a>&nbsp;for crude oil was about 18.8 million barrels per day during 2009 and 19.1 million barrels per day during 2010. The daily global demand for oil during 2009 was 84.3 million barrels per day, meaning the U.S. accounted for 22 percent of the world&rsquo;s oil consumption that year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we&rsquo;ve reported before, the U.S. possesses about 1.5 percent of the world&rsquo;s proven oil reserves.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoran said, &nbsp;&quot;American oil production is at its highest level since 2003.&quot; He&rsquo;s right that production hit a seven-year peak in 2010. The government projects a decline could be imminent. But at this point, there is no solid evidence that the decline has begun.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen PolitiFact national evaluated this issue in March, the EIA was projecting a sizable production decline this year.
