Here&rsquo;s video of them departing on Air Force One that night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.washingtonpost.com/video/c/embed/88fd1d80-c3f8-11e6-92e8-c07f4f671da4\" width=\"700\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Per White House pool reports, Obama played rounds of golf on Dec. 17, 19, 21 and 23. The First Family has also spent time at the beach, walked a nature trail at a botanical garden, played escape the room and dined at a popular Japanese restaurant &mdash; all in Hawaii. On Christmas Day, the President and First Lady visited troops at a marine base, again in Hawaii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several of the other claims made in the article are entirely fabricated. The Obamas never took Air Force One to Chicago for White Castle burgers. There is no Air Force Osprey specifically to transport the First Dog. (Here&rsquo;s an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/0510/first_family_in_chicago_016384ba-8997-4f2d-ab31-4ee6235a9829.html\">article</a> describing Bo walking up and down the aisle of Air Force One.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article&rsquo;s assertion that Air Force One is not obligated to fly anywhere &quot;unless it was on official business&quot; lacks critical context. Vacation trips fall under the official travel category as the president and vice president are assumed to be always on duty, <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21835.pdf\">according to the Congressional Research Service</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article also includes a picture of the First Family&rsquo;s dog, Bo, departing a marine helicopter.
