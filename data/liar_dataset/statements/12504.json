But the Gazette&rsquo;s claim seemed outlandish and ripe for a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three days after the election, Clinton had more than 2 million votes to Sanders&rsquo; nearly 1.6 million, for a lead of about 450,000 votes, according to the California Secretary of State&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/president/party/democratic/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>website</u></a>.

(AP Photo/John Locher)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After early California primary results showed a big Clinton lead over Sanders, the Justice Gazette posted the headline on June 7: &quot;Bernie Sanders Wins California But \u2154 of his Votes Aren&rsquo;t Counted.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three days later, Clinton continues to lead Sanders by about 450,000. There are more than two million uncounted votes. But based on polling shortly before the race, showing Sanders even or slightly ahead with voters who had yet to cast ballots, professional pollsters and news outlets say Clinton&rsquo;s lead could shrink somewhat but is not in danger. Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by a huge margin, something no polls showed in advance of Election Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is evidence that California&rsquo;s complicated voting rules led to problems. That may have prevented some Sanders supporters from voting for him and, for that matter, some Clinton supporters from voting for her. But there&rsquo;s no proof to back up the outlandish claim that Sanders <em>won </em>California or that <em>two-thirds</em> of his votes were not counted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the Gazette&rsquo;s claim Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>PANTS ON FIRE</strong> &ndash; The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> more </a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-10T17:23:10.003722", "ruling_date": "2016-06-10T15:28:58", "ruling_headline": "Pants On Fire for viral rumor Bernie Sanders won California", "ruling_headline_slug": "pants-fire-viral-rumor-bernie-sanders-won-californ", "ruling_link_text": "No evidence to back up viral post about Bernie Sanders", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Justice Gazette, <a href=\"http://justicegazette.org/bernie-defrauded-in-ca.html\">&quot;</a><a href=\"http://justicegazette.org/bernie-defrauded-in-ca.html\">Bernie Sanders Wins California Landslide But \u2154 of his Votes Aren&rsquo;t Counted,&quot;</a> June 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Ben Tulchin, national pollster, Bernie Sanders For President, June 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Mark DiCamillo, Field Poll director, June 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Field Poll, <a href=\"http://www.field.com/fieldpollonline/subscribers/Rls2537.pdf\">California&#39;s Democratic Presidential Primary Tightening</a>, June 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/president/party/democratic/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Democratic presidential primary results</a>, accessed June 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/statewide-elections/2016-primary/unprocessed-ballots-report.pdf\">Estimated Unprocessed Ballots for June 7, 2016 primary</a>, accessed June 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://vote.sos.ca.gov/unprocessed-ballots-status/\">Unprocessed Ballot Status</a>, accessed June 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Los Angeles Times,&quot;<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-voting-problems-20160607-snap-htmlstory.html\">&#39;It was just chaos&#39;: Broken machines, incomplete voter rolls leave some wondering whether their ballots will count</a>,&quot; June 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/uncounted-california-ballots/\">It&#39;s true that millions of California ballots have yet to be certified, but the process is transparent and well documented</a>, June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacramento Bee, <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article82527617.html\">&quot;Why California looked close for Bernie Sanders, but wasn&rsquo;t,</a>&quot; June 8, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "", "false_count": 82, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 280, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 416, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Bernie Sanders &quot;wins California landslide, But \u2154 of his votes aren&rsquo;t counted.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline in the Justice Gazette", "statement_date": "2016-06-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Claims Bernie Sanders won Calif. bogus -- Pants on Fire!"}
