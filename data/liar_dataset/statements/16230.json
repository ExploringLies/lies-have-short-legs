But U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., asserts the label comes with even more restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing her desire to make marijuana more available for American veterans, Baldwin said she is frustrated that marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug, &quot;which is considered a drug with no beneficial characteristics at all, and therefore should not be researched or prescribed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said research is a key reason she wants to see marijuana removed from Schedule 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So we lost, since that scheduling occurred, more than a generation of possible research to see safety, efficacy, etc.,&quot; Baldwin said in a Sept. 14, 2018,<a href=\"https://realresistanceradio.com/podcast/9-14-18-us-senator-tammy-baldwin/\"> interview</a> on &quot;Devil&rsquo;s Advocates,&quot; a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. &quot;So, (the) No. 1 outrage to me is that we don&rsquo;t have the body of research in this country &mdash; the leading research-funding nation in the world &mdash; that would give answers to things we kind of ponder about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We gave Baldwin a<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/09/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-tammy-baldwins-claim-va-doctors-are-censore/\"> Mostly False</a> rating for another marijuana claim from that interview -- that medical providers with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are &quot;censored&quot; from talking with veterans about marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this claim fares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does Schedule 1 mean?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schedule 1 is the highest, most restrictive rating given to drugs in the<a href=\"https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/2108cfrt.htm\"> federal code</a>. Marijuana is joined on that list by heroin, ecstasy, LSD and opioid painkillers, among many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The designation complicates matters for federal agencies such as the VA, which is limited by federal guidelines that conflict with state laws. Thirty-three states have now approved medical marijuana, and 10 of those allow recreational use as well, according to the<a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx\"> National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin&rsquo;s staff did not respond to inquiries seeking evidence for her claim that the Schedule 1 designation means marijuana &quot;should not be researched.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, there are hundreds of current research studies involving marijuana, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One of the biggest misconceptions is that Schedule I status of a drug makes it impossible for research. &nbsp;This is simply not true,&quot; said Wade Sparks, a DEA spokesman. &quot;Schedule I research is absolutely permitted with a proper registration.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aspiring researchers must get their research protocol approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then<a href=\"https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/webforms/jsp/regapps/common/newAppLogin.jsp\"> apply</a> for a DEA permit to handle, store and research marijuana or any other Schedule 1 drug. Sparks said security is typically a key hurdle, since the DEA must ensure research protocol is followed and drugs are properly secured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every researcher who has put forth a valid research proposal has received permission to study marijuana,&quot; Sparks said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers must also work with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which contracts with the University of Mississippi to grow marijuana for research &mdash; the only legal research source of marijuana in the country. And there are U.S. Food and Drug Administration<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/publichealthfocus/ucm421173.htm\"> requirements</a> for research that is related to the development of new drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are currently 449 researchers registered with the DEA to study marijuana, and 249 registered for research of other Schedule 1 drugs, Sparks said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, much of that research is funded by the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx\">National Institutes of Health</a> approved about $269 million for hundreds of marijuana-related research projects in 2018. That includes projects focused on therapeutic properties of marijuana, including cannabidiol, which has potential medical benefits but doesn&rsquo;t cause users to get high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the last few years with the growth of information &mdash; both popular information and scientific information &mdash; on possible medical marijuana efficacy, there have been more studies approved by the federal government and funded by the federal government&quot; on the potential therapeutic benefits of the drug, said <a href=\"https://www.cmcr.ucsd.edu/index.php/directory\">Igor Grant</a>, director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California-San Diego. &quot;The climate is changing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making the case to remove marijuana from Schedule 1 status, Baldwin said that standing means marijuana &quot;should not be researched.&quot; She said a &quot;generation&quot; of possible research has been lost as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schedule 1 status does add additional hurdles for researchers, including approval from the DEA. But research is allowed and does happen &mdash; to the tune of more than 400 studies nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the statement has an element of truth but otherwise misses the mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating for that is Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-14T17:57:23.752098", "ruling_date": "2018-11-21T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Sen.
