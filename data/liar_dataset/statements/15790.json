The Aug. 25 story had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/28/trump-wakes-up-googles-himself-and-doesnt-like-what-he-sees-illegal/?utm_term=.aaffe9f98fde\">attracted</a> some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/08/28/a-short-investigation-into-trumps-tweets-on-rigged-google-results-about-himself/?utm_term=.d23e08ffc557\">attention</a> in conservative media circles before getting picked up by Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is Google manipulating its algorithm to prioritize left-leaning news outlets in their coverage of President Trump?&quot; Paula Bolyard, PJ Media&rsquo;s supervising editor, wrote in the article. &quot;It sure looks that way based on recent search results for news on the president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To test the premise, Bolyard performed a<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=trump&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4tvnSxYfdAhWR14MKHVq8C9wQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=649\"> Google search for &quot;Trump</a>&quot; using the search engine&#39;s &quot;News&quot; tab and analyzed the results using<a href=\"https://sharylattkisson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-23-at-1.43.33-PM.png\"> a media bias chart</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of 76 total stories, most came from outlets such as CNN, the Washington Post and NBC. Only three came up from the Wall Street Journal, which is labeled right-leaning by the chart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolyard wrote that she repeated her search &quot;multiple times using different computers (registered to different users) and Google returned similar results.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolyard acknowledged that while the study is &quot;not scientific,&quot; though she did conclude that &quot;the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this conclusion is debatable, and Trump&rsquo;s reporting of the results is more problematic still.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Factors that go into Google searches</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There is broad agreement that the factors that go into Google&rsquo;s algorithms for news searches are opaque. And the lack of transparency can allow theories about ideological bias to flourish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They &quot;depend on a lot of factors, including what other people are searching for, what they&#39;re clicking on, what sites link to a given search result, whether the website is optimized for mobile, and even whether the site supports encrypted HTTPS,&quot; said Jeremy Gillula, tech policy director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. &quot;But with all that said, Google&#39;s search algorithms are still a black box, and we&#39;d prefer if Google gave users more information and control over the factors that influence search results.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement, Google said that ideological factors do not play a role in its algorithms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Search is not used to set a political agenda, and we don&#39;t bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users&#39; queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if one considers Google&rsquo;s algorithmic factors to be &quot;biases,&quot; that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they are ideological biases. Searches, for instance, are widely believed to favor newer content and original sources rather than aggregations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the very least, there should be a fair amount of variability in search results over time. A study made during one snapshot in time, such as the one published in PJ Media, will not produce the same results a few hours later, as new articles come online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolyard, in an email interview with PolitiFact, noted that she mentioned some of the caveats in her article. In the article, she cautioned that &quot;factors such as the relevance of the topic, the design of the website, internal and external links, and the way articles are written and formatted all can affect a site&#39;s Google traffic. Google is constantly tweaking their algorithm, and a website&#39;s traffic prospects can rise or fall depending on the changes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Trump made no indication in his tweets that the findings could be chalked up to anything beyond ideological bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Rating news outlets&rsquo; ideology</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A more problematic aspect of the study is the metric used to label websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; Bolyard used a chart of media outlets assembled by Sharyl Attkisson, a former CBS correspondent who hosts the Sunday morning program &quot;Full Measure&quot; for Sinclair Broadcasting, a network of local stations that has taken a pro-Trump editorial stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://sharylattkisson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-23-at-1.43.33-PM.png\">version of the chart</a> Bolyard linked to:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chart is not neutral evidence supporting Trump&rsquo;s point, and it labels anything not overtly conservative as &quot;left. In the &quot;left&quot; category are such rigorously mainstream outlets as the Associated Press and Reuters. The three big broadcast networks &mdash; ABC, NBC, CBS &mdash; are considered &quot;left,&quot; as are the Washington Post and the New York Times. Other media outlets that produce a large amount of content every day, including CNN, NPR, Politico, USA Today, and CNBC, are labeled &quot;left.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that most of media entities that produce large amounts of widely read and cited news content -- factors that might well give them a leg up in the Google algorithm -- are defined by the chart, and thus by the PJ Media study, as &quot;left-wing.&quot; So, by its design, the study guarantees that an enormous percentage of Trump news coverage would falls into what the chart defines as &quot;left.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full disclosure: PolitiFact and its owner, the Poynter Institute, are both listed on the chart as left of center. We actually consider ourselves not to have an ideological leaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a &lsquo;study&rsquo; designed to come up with the outcome it came up with, and it did just that,&quot; Chip Stewart, a professor at Texas Christian University&rsquo;s Bob Schieffer College of Communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the &quot;left&quot; category lumps these large-staffed, comprehensive news outlets in with genuinely liberal-to-left outlets, such as the Daily Kos, Salon, the Nation, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and Media Matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more revealing comparison would be to compare search results of truly left-wing sites vs. truly right-wing sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a written description of the chart, Attkisson <a href=\"https://sharylattkisson.com/2018/08/28/media-bias-a-new-chart/\">acknowledged</a> that the graphic is &quot;subjective&quot; and writes that &quot;position on the chart doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply credibility or lack thereof. Sources on far right and far left have, in many instances, produced excellent, factually correct information at times.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolyard agreed that &quot;any chart that attempts to quantify media bias is going to be inherently subjective.&quot; But she added that &quot;while it may be fair to quibble with Attkisson&#39;s assertion about how far left-of-center some major media outlets are, I think it&#39;s entirely fair to say that outlets like NBC, the New York Times, and CNN skew to the left, especially in their coverage of the president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart, however, rejected the notion that the algorithm has ideological bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A far more plausible explanation is that the items that drive the algorithm &mdash; links, shares, etc. &mdash; are more common among the so-called liberal publications, which have a long track record of credible journalism and try to cater to a wider audience,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, Trump used the 96 percent figure without taking into account any of these methodological concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump tweeted that &quot;96 percent of (Google News) results on &lsquo;Trump News&rsquo; are from National Left-Wing Media.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This figure is based on a non-scientific study from a conservative website that categorized any media outlet not expressly conservative as being part of the &quot;left.&quot; These outlets include wire services, broadcast networks and most major newspapers and collectively account for a large percentage of original news reports produced in the United States. The&nbsp;methodology essentially preordains that a large percentage of coverage captured by Google will be what the study defines as &quot;left,&quot; which is wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-29T10:25:17.152512", "ruling_date": "2018-08-29T11:57:19", "ruling_headline": "No, 96% of Google news stories on Trump aren't from left-wing outlets", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-96-google-news-stories-trump-arent-left-wing-ou", "ruling_link_text": "Study's design pre-ordained that result", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1034456273306243076\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>pair</u></a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1034456281120206848\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>tweets</u></a>, Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PJ Media, &quot;<a href=\"https://pjmedia.com/trending/google-search-results-show-pervasive-anti-trump-anti-conservative-bias/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>96 Percent of Google Search Results for &#39;Trump&#39; News Are from Liberal Media Outlets</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharyl Attkisson, <a href=\"https://sharylattkisson.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-23-at-1.43.33-PM.png\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>media bias chart</u></a>, accessed Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/08/28/a-short-investigation-into-trumps-tweets-on-rigged-google-results-about-himself/?utm_term=.0ad63288d559\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>A short investigation into Trump&rsquo;s claims of &lsquo;RIGGED&rsquo; Google results against him</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/28/trump-wakes-up-googles-himself-and-doesnt-like-what-he-sees-illegal/?utm_term=.0e5221e2649d\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump&rsquo;s economic adviser: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re taking a look&rsquo; at whether Google searches should be regulated</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jeremy Gillula, tech policy director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Chip Stewart, professor at Texas Christian University&rsquo;s Bob Schieffer College of Communication, Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Paula Bolyard, supervising editor at PJ Media, Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says &quot;96 percent of (Google News) results on &lsquo;Trump News&rsquo; are from National Left-Wing Media.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2018-08-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 115, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/115/", "subject": "Technology", "subject_slug": "technology", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "No, 96% of Google news stories on Trump aren't from left-wing outlets"}
