President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have both come out for Moore&rsquo;s chief opponent, Luther Strange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the latest salvo, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by McConnell&rsquo;s former chief of staff, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_TUN2MDZHcEMzYm8\">aired an ad</a> that essentially tells viewers that Moore opposes Trump&rsquo;s wall along the Mexican border.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s the full text:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Male voice: </strong>&quot;Who will fight with President Trump to change Washington? Not career politician Roy Moore. He&rsquo;s on the wrong side of Trump&rsquo;s border wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Video clip of Moore:</strong> &quot;I&rsquo;ll tell you a little secret. Does it take a wall?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Video clip of Moore:</strong> &quot;I don&rsquo;t think it would take a wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Repeats the same clip of Moore: </strong>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think it would take a wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Male voice: </strong>&quot;Roy Moore. Dead wrong on President Trump&rsquo;s wall to protect our borders.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Audio clip of Moore:</strong> &quot;You can&rsquo;t build a wall around our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a case where the individual elements of the ad hold up, but the package deal paints an incomplete picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad uses video selectively. A good example comes from the rest of Moore&rsquo;s words at the forum where he said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t think it would take a wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a more complete excerpt of his remarks:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we need something to stop illegal aliens flowing across our borders, because they are a danger to our republic, a danger to our homes, our families, and we can do something,&quot; Moore said at the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/227893765\">Wetumpka T.E.A. Party candidate forum</a> on July 31. &quot;I support using federal troops (and the) National Guard to stop this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A moment later, he continued, &quot;If it takes a wall, we should build it. I don&#39;t think it would take a wall. I think we should use the United States military.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Dy_NTyeXNM\">Aug. 15 radio interview</a>, Moore expressed impatience with the pace of fortifying the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Here we are, waiting since November and nothing&rsquo;s been done in stopping illegal aliens,&quot; Moore said. &quot;It can be stopped within days by the U.S. military ... We need to stop illegal aliens coming in and then, if a wall is necessary and we&rsquo;ve got the money, we can build it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.roymoore.org/Positions/\">campaign website</a> says, &quot;We must allow willing states (like Arizona) to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, and use our own military to protect our border. If a wall is our only option, then we should build it immediately.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris Pack, a spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, said Moore&rsquo;s stance is at variance with Trump&rsquo;s position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Roy Moore has repeatedly said he doesn&rsquo;t think we need a wall and that it should be &lsquo;the last recourse,&rsquo; or as &lsquo;the last thing we need to do,&rsquo; &quot;Pack said. &quot;President Trump, by contrast, has called the wall &lsquo;absolutely necessary,&rsquo; &lsquo;so vital,&rsquo; and &lsquo;very, very important.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pack went on to say, &quot;Our ad is simply pointing out that Roy Moore is not with Trump in pushing for the wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advocates of the wall argue that, unlike a military deployment, it would be a barrier that would outlast any change in leadership or policy in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate Leadership Fund ad describes Moore as being on the &quot;wrong side of Trump&rsquo;s border wall.&quot; Based on that and the clips in the ad, most viewers might reasonably think that means Moore is against a wall. In fact, Moore doesn&rsquo;t want to wait and would rather deploy the American military immediately to secure the border with Mexico. If after that a wall is needed, he said the country should build it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we have is more of a difference on tactics, not overall strategy or outcomes. The ad makes it sound like the gap is more than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts the would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-15T16:38:15.233223", "ruling_date": "2017-09-18T08:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP super PAC says Alabama's Roy Moore doesn't back Trump's border wall", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-super-pac-says-alabamas-roy-moore-doesnt-back-", "ruling_link_text": "Quotes pulled out of context", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Senate Leadership Fund, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_TUN2MDZHcEMzYm8\">Wall</a>, Sept. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wetumpka T.E.A.&nbsp;Party, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/227893765\">Candidate forum</a>, July 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WBHP, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-Dy_NTyeXNM\">Roy Moore interview</a>, Aug. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roy Moore for Senate, <a href=\"https://www.roymoore.org/Positions/\">Positions</a>, accessed Sept 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Chris Pack, spokesman, Senate Leadership Fund, Sept. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Katie Frost, communications director, Roy Moore for Senate, Sept. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 3705, "last_name": "Senate Leadership Fund", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "senate-leadership-fund", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/SLF.PNG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3705/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.senateleadershipfund.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Roy Moore is &quot;on the wrong side of Trump&rsquo;s border wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "an attack ad", "statement_date": "2017-09-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
