Nevertheless, even after considering these factors, a gap still exists.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;Economic research shows that, even after controlling for work experience, family division of labor and compensating wage differentials for dangerous jobs, there is still an unexplained gender wage gap,&quot; said George-Levi Gayle, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ftp.iza.org/dp9656.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A study from the Institute for the Study of Labor</a>, an economic research institute based in Bonn, Germany, shows the unexplained wage gap in the United States falls somewhere between 8 percent and 18 percent of the total earnings difference, if the figures are adjusted for additional factors.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Using the high-end estimate, the $9.5 billion figure falls to about $1.7&nbsp;billion.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Gayle said gender stereotypes and bias can explain the remaining disparities.

The latest government numbers show that for men and women working full time year-round in Missouri, the gap is more than $9.5 billion.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Some, but far from all, of the gap is due to bias and discrimination. Economic studies show the wage gap shrinks when you control for factors such as differences in the jobs men and women do and length of time in the workforce.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The bias related portion of the gap could be as much as $1.7&nbsp;billion. That&rsquo;s a lot of money, but it isn&rsquo;t the $9 billion Koster claimed. When we&rsquo;ve rated such claims before, statements that speak broadly about a wage gap, regardless of the underlying factors, get some benefit of the doubt.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Koster&rsquo;s claim greatly oversimplifies a very complex situation, but the size of the gap is real.
