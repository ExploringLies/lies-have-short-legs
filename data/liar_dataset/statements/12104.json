Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day,&quot; Pitts wrote. &quot;Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC calculates <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/overdose_data1999-2014.xls\">overdose deaths</a> from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KzXIgbTqfDPyk4eOY-G4sRtrtTaluAP_N5XyvJZgkHavUmofr2eqxwndnMbbgmg0ItCJvEL1iVWtO9hQE0BucDduQyv0207SOXiuujvN4mQaPHo6UfpJQklKPX2aQ6WxowbJCF11\" style=\"border:none; height:469px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YJplZQFYHqUC7STHK983caKikmaj_I99mo9kTYcn-J-MdHpA9OxUPkFuc5XCsJOqjskN6cxN0PFGVvhztbrRZ5eY1MHvk0Z5FkOpHtWYcjD_Onvah8Xdpcu4LZlwEgYhM-QnxApf\" style=\"border:none; height:469px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5AFo5xxe67UdMx8bIU9EWdRWaqOGfUBKjyDHQnvUkf8IQYmF8HBbmBFNQUQIinkEVVVOahyobodozozEVnLToTwweL_EoHhHgpgDLh8b0mpFlKhkWmrzhSNqRuJY-Cm3h4kTLMDs\" style=\"border:none; height:469px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That&rsquo;s close enough for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html\">According to CDC</a>, there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts&rsquo; second claim correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pitts said that &quot;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.&quot; Pitts is very close on the first part, and he&rsquo;s correct on the second. So we rate his statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-21T17:12:40.030584", "ruling_date": "2016-03-21T17:33:30", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
