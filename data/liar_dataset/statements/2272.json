This is not a mosque. It&#39;s a cultural center that has a prayer area.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHunt&#39;s comment echoed Frank Rich who stated in an Aug. 21, 2010, <i goog_docs_charindex=\"566\"><a goog_docs_charindex=\"567\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/opinion/22rich.html?_r=2&amp;src=me&amp;ref=homepage\" id=\"v._e\" title=\"New York Times op-ed\">New York Times op-ed</a></i>, &quot;It&rsquo;s not a mosque but an Islamic cultural center containing a prayer room.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the developing organization repeatedly refers to the religious component of the site as a mosque.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the website for the project (<a href=\"http://www.park51.org/faq.htm\">Park51.org</a>), the plan sounds more like a Muslim YMCA-type operation. The site&#39;s <a goog_docs_charindex=\"782\" href=\"http://www.park51.org/facilities.htm\" id=\"qsre\" title=\"&quot;facilities&quot; page\">&quot;facilities&quot; page</a>&nbsp;details plans for a &quot;world-class community center&quot; open to all New Yorkers, regardless of faith. According to the site, plans include: a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios, childcare services and a September 11 memorial and &quot;quiet contemplation space, open to all.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe plan also includes &quot;a mosque, intended to be run separately from Park51 but open to and accessible to all members, visitors and our New York community.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOrganizers say the center would be used to promote cultural diversity and would be overseen by a 23-member Board of Directors, whose membership will not be limited to Muslims. But the center would be geared toward &quot;engaging New York&rsquo;s many and diverse Muslim communities and promoting empowerment and compassion for all.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother page of the website explains that the project, called Park51, is an independent project led by American Muslims. On that <a goog_docs_charindex=\"1813\" href=\"http://www.park51.org/faq.htm\" id=\"wph_\" title=\"same page\">same page</a>, it states, &quot;The mosque, yet to be named, will be run by a separate non-profit whose Board of Directors will reflect a broad range of experience. While the mosque will be located in the planned final structure of Park51, it will be a distinct non-profit.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a July 24, 2010, interview with <a goog_docs_charindex=\"2117\" href=\"http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/we_want_to_build_park51_so_it_has_something_for_everyone/\" id=\"si9n\" title=\"altmuslim.com\">altmuslim.com</a>, an Islamic news site, Sharif El-Gamal, owner of the building and developer of the Park51 project, was asked, &quot;Why must the project necessarily include a mosque? Wouldn&#39;t a general prayer area, which could be reserved in advance by any religious group, be more appropriate and compatible with the community-centric interfaith mission of the project?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGamal answered, in part, &quot;With respect to the mosque, which will take up only a small portion of the final space, it&rsquo;s a question of meeting a need. This mosque will be open to all. There are probably one million Muslims in the tri-state area and several hundred thousand in New York City.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe also turned to a website for the <a goog_docs_charindex=\"2813\" href=\"http://www.cordobainitiative.org/?q=content/frequently-asked-questions\" id=\"eg9k\" title=\"Cordoba Initiative\">Cordoba Initiative</a>, &quot;a multi-faith non-profit organization whose aim is to improve relations between different communities, and in particular between the Muslim world and the United States of America&quot; which was founded by Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who along with Gamal acts as project manager of the Park51 site.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; page is one that asks, &quot;Why are you building a mosque at Ground zero?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe response:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The community center is not located at Ground Zero.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It will be a multi-floor community center open to all New Yorkers, much like a YMCA or Jewish Community Center (JCC) with a designated prayer space (mosque) in one area to serve the needs of the large existing community of American Muslims in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The community center will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their culture or background, will find a place of learning, arts and culture, and, most importantly, a community center guided by the universal values of all religions in their truest form &ndash; peace, compassion, generosity, and respect for all.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe note that the &quot;mosque&quot; in parentheses is their word, not ours.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tImam Rauf has been leading prayer services in one of the buildings -- a former Burlington Coat Factory -- since 2009, drawing a spillover from the imam&#39;s former main place for prayers, the al-Farah mosque about a dozen blocks north of the World Trade Center grounds, according to the <i goog_docs_charindex=\"4240\"><a goog_docs_charindex=\"4241\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/18/AR2010081804759.html?sid=ST2010081806973\" id=\"sqr9\" title=\"Washington Post\">Washington Post</a></i>. According to the <em>Post</em>, the site&#39;s organizers estimated that the mosque could attract as many as 2,000 worshipers on Fridays.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo how exactly does one define a mosque according to Islamic tradition, as opposed to simply a prayer space? We explored this very issue a bit when we researched a claim from Kendrick Meek, a Democratic Senate hopeful, who said <a goog_docs_charindex=\"4616\" href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/aug/19/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-theres-mosque-pentagon/\" id=\"h::t\" title=\"there is a mosque at the Pentagon\">there is a mosque at the Pentagon</a>. It turns out there is a non-denominational chapel at the Pentagon, and it is used once a day by Muslim employees who gather there for prayer services.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile that might be considered a sacred place by those who use it, it doesn&#39;t meet the definition of a mosque, according to Shafayat Mohamed, imam of the Darul Uloom mosque in Pembroke Pines, Fla. &quot;The main thing that makes a mosque a mosque is the establishment of praying five times a day at that spot,&quot; Mohamed said. &quot;If people pray five times per day, then it is considered a regular mosque.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe agree with those who say it&#39;s imprecise to simply refer to the New York project as a mosque. As is clear from the organizers&#39; comments and formal web pages, the big picture plans are for a $100 million, 15-story Muslim community center that would be open to New Yorkers of all faiths. But those comments and websites also make clear that the plans do include a &quot;mosque.&quot; It may be a &quot;small portion&quot; of the overall project, but it is a part. And so when Hunt said, &quot;This is not a mosque. It&#39;s a cultural center that has a prayer area,&quot; that&#39;s not accurate either. It&#39;s a cultural center that includes a mosque. And so we rate Hunt&#39;s comment False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-23T15:45:53.902782", "ruling_date": "2010-08-23T17:06:46", "ruling_headline": "Is the \"Ground Zero Mosque\" not even a mosque?", "ruling_headline_slug": "ground-zero-mosque-not-even-mosque", "ruling_link_text": "It's an Islamic cultural center, with a mosque", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/thisweek/video/roundtable-summer-recovery-11455401&amp;tab=9482930&amp;section=1206874&amp;playlist=11455556\">ABC &quot;This Week&quot; roundtable discussion</a>, Aug. 22, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNew York Times, Op-ed:<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/opinion/22rich.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=homepage\"> &quot;How Fox Betrayed Petraeus,&quot;</a> by Frank Rich, Aug. 21, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCordoba Initiative, <a href=\"http://www.cordobainitiative.org/?q=content/frequently-asked-questions\">The Proposed Community Center Project in Lower Manhattan FAQs</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/aug/20/fact-checking-ground-zero-mosque-debate/\">&quot;Fact-checking the &#39;Ground Zero mosque&#39; debate,&quot;</a> by Robert Farley, Aug. 20, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWashington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/view-from-ground-zero-mosque/\">The view from Ground Zero</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNewsweek, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/08/war-over-ground-zero.html\">&quot;War Over Ground Zero,&quot;</a> by Lisa Miller, Aug. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.park51.org/vision.htm\">Park51.org</a>, the web site of the organizers of the cultural center/mosque project</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAP, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_mosque_fact_check\">&quot;Fact Check: Islam already lives near ground zero,&quot;</a> by Calvin Woodward, Aug. 19, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWashington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/18/AR2010081804759.html?sid=ST2010081806973\">&quot;Mosque near Ground Zero: Frequently asked questions,&quot;</a> Aug. 18, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAltmuslim.com,<a href=\"http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/a/we_want_to_build_park51_so_it_has_something_for_everyone/\"> &quot;We want to build Park51 so it has something for everyone,&quot;</a> by Aziz Poonawalla and Shahed Amanullah, July 24, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Executive editor for Washington for Bloomberg News", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Al", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 504, "last_name": "Hunt", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "al-hunt", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Al_Hunt.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/504/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;This is not a mosque.
