Evers responded more generally by saying: &quot;I would support looking at anything, whether it&rsquo;s removing tax credits, whether it&rsquo;s slimming down state government, whether it&rsquo;s gas taxes. Everything is on the table.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. &quot;The only thing I ever said about that,&quot; Evers declared, &quot;is that every possible revenue source is on the table.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers has also said, in speaking about road funding, he <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/16/scott-walker-tony-evers-arent-spelling-out-their-plans-roads/1008438002/\">&quot;has no range&quot; </a>&nbsp;in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider.
