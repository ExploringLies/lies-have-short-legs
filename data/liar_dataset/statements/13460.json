As it is, the District 24 Democratic nominee declared: &quot;We spend more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Previous analyses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we recognize that prisons are 24/7 operations that provide housing, meals, rehabilitation programs and other services for a housed population. Meantime, students in public schools attend classes for roughly eight hours a day, five days a week, for about 180 days each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to compare prison and school spending as an example of what they consider unbalanced budget priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2013/jan/18/john-kitzhaber/does-oregon-spend-10000-year-student-30000-inmate/\">PolitiFact Oregon found True</a> a claim that Oregon was spending about $10,000 a year per student compared with $30,000 per inmate, a move the governor said showed the state prioritized prisons over schools. In 2015, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/nov/23/bernie-s/sanders-says-it-costs-more-send-person-prison-univ/\">PolitiFact Virginia rated Half True</a> a statement by Sen. Bernie Sanders that it costs more to go to prison than to the University of Virginia. Sanders based his claim on what it costs to house a federal prisoner, but at the state level the cost comes out to be less than a year&rsquo;s fees to attend the university, particularly if considering out-of-state tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/03/14/states-spend-times-incarcerating-educating-studies-say-464156987.html\">Fox News found in 2011</a> that most states, &quot;despite spending more money overall on education, are spending three to four times more per capita incarcerating prisoners than they are educating students.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2016, the U.S. Department of Education released a report that compared the rise in spending on prisons with the rate of spending on public education. The report found that nationwide, public pre-K through grade 12 expenditures went up 107 percent while state and local corrections expenditures increased by 324 percent over a 33-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leeder cites CNN </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Leeder before she lost to Republican <a href=\"http://dawnbuckingham.com/about/\">Dawn Buckingham</a> of Lakeway about the basis of her statement as quoted in an October 2016 <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/buckingham-leeder-vie-for-open-hill-country-state-/nsr7s/\">news article</a>. On Leeder&#39;s behalf, Steven Rivas replied by emailing us web links from a briefing book that Rivas said the candidate took on the road to meet with teacher groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Leeder&rsquo;s comment to the <em>American-Statesman</em> didn&rsquo;t specify if she meant Texas or the nation in saying &quot;we,&quot; the provided web links focused on Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among Leeder&#39;s offerings: A&nbsp;May 2013 <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/infographic/economy/education-vs-prison-costs/\">CNN Money infographic</a>, &quot;Education vs prison costs,&quot; indicating that nationally in 2012, every state spent more to hold inmates than it did on educating students with New York having the biggest dollar difference, spending about $40,000 more per inmate per year, and Kentucky appearing to have the smallest difference, annually spending $6,000 more per inmate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Texas, according to the graphic, the year&rsquo;s cost per student hovered below $10,000 while the cost per inmate landed near $20,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We learned from a CNN footnote that the per-student spending figures came from the Census Bureau and the costs per inmate traced from&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.vera.org/\">Vera Institute</a>, a New York-based nonprofit research group that says it&rsquo;s focused on ending mass incarceration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scarlet Neath, an institute spokeswoman, responded to our email inquiry with links to a 2012 report, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.vera.org/publications/the-price-of-prisons-what-incarceration-costs-taxpayers\">The Price of Prisons</a>.&quot; In the report, researchers calculated the cost of incarceration to taxpayers, accounting for expenses such as employee benefits, pension contributions and capital costs through a survey of 40 states. According to its <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/vera-web-assets/downloads/Publications/the-price-of-prisons-what-incarceration-costs-taxpayers/legacy_downloads/the-price-of-prisons-40-fact-sheets-updated-072012.pdf\">Texas assessment</a>, the state spent $3.3 billion on prisons in fiscal 2010, which ran through August 2010, or $21,390 per inmate--or, in keeping with Leeder&rsquo;s &quot;per day&quot; statement, $58.60 a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then again, that was six-plus years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Updated Texas spending</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get an up-to-date grasp on Leeder&rsquo;s comparison, we started by eliciting figures from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the agency tasked with running state prisons and jails. In 2012, the agency had an operating budget of $3,087,899,321, and there were 152,303 offenders incarcerated, agency spokesman Jason Clark told us by email. Based on these numbers, the fiscal 2012 per inmate cost boiled out to $20,275, or $55.55 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clark told us the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on fiscal matters, reaches its own estimates of such per-day costs. Clark pointed us to the board&rsquo;s 2013 <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Documents/Publications/Policy_Report/Criminal%20Justice%20Uniform%20Cost%20Report%20Fiscal%20Years%202010%20to%202012.pdf\">Criminal Justice Uniform Cost Report</a>, which says that the state spent $50.04 per day per prisoner in fiscal 2012. The report says that figure reflects the costs of programs offered at specific prison units, such as sex offender or substance abuse treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we searched the Census Bureau website to find its breakdown of per student state, federal and local education spending. In the latest analysis, a <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/econ/g14-aspef.pdf\">2016 report </a>called &quot;Public Education Finances,&quot; Texas was shown to spend $8,593 per student in fiscal 2014. To reach a per-day cost, we divided that figure by 180, the <a href=\"http://tea.texas.gov/About_TEA/Contact_Us/General_Inquiry/General_Inquiry_-_General_Questions_FAQ/#held_back\">minimum number of days in a Texas school year</a>--getting an estimated daily cost of $47.73 per student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A web search led us to a similar <a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/2016_NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates.pdf\">2016 report</a>, from the National Education Association, a teacher labor union, that cited bureau figures for state, federal and local spending to estimate the annual per student cost in 2015 for Texas at $8,935, which breaks out to $49.64 per day, we found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we pursued spending figures from the Texas Education Agency. According to the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzqR4MkGxK5WNm5LM3dKWk45eHc/view?usp=sharing\">agency&rsquo;s online database</a>, the 2011-2012 school year&rsquo;s budget for all school districts totaled $49,623,331,143. Districts spent $9,969 per student that year, according to the agency&rsquo;s calculation, that divided the state&rsquo;s total revenue for school districts by the total number of students, except for those taught for less than two hours per day that year. That total comes out to a per day cost of $55.38, we calculated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upshot: Breaking down annual spending to expenditures per day tightens the usual prison-education comparison. That is, the $55.38 that Texas spent on average to schoolchildren in 2011-12 is very close to our estimate that the state ponied up $55.55 a day in 2012 for state prisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For perspective on the comparison, we reached Lori Taylor, a Texas A&amp;M University school finance expert, who told us there&rsquo;s research that suggests higher educational attainment can reduce the likelihood of crime, yet in her view that&rsquo;s not an argument for unconstrained education spending. &quot;To argue that spending on schools should increase requires, in my mind, a description of what you expect schools to accomplish with the extra cash,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leeder said Texas spends &quot;more per day to house an inmate than we do on a student.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This contention holds up if you divide total costs for prisons versus schools&nbsp;by the 365 days in a year. It&rsquo;s also narrowly so--by 17 cents a day in 2012, we found--if you limit the school part of Leeder&rsquo;s comparison to the 180 days in a Texas school year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.
