The practice has been beneficial, the company says, because veterans have the traits of leadership, teamwork and dedication it seeks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow looking to hire more veterans for up to 45 jobs at its Lakewood and Parma, Ohio, facilities, GrafTech has found an added benefit: tax incentives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides job training for service members making the transition to civilian life, also provides tax credit of up to $9,600 to companies hiring unemployed veterans. (VOW stands for Veterans Opportunity to Work.) The legislation was signed into law in November.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSen. Sherrod Brown, who co-sponsored the act, visited GrafTech to highlight the need for it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Today, many veterans -&mdash; including our young veterans -&mdash; face an unacceptably high unemployment rate,&quot; the Democrat said. &quot;More than one in five of veterans aged 20 to 24 can&rsquo;t find a job to support their family or to ease the transition to civilian life.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore than one in five means an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent among young veterans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat got PolitiFact Ohio&rsquo;s attention. It&#39;s considerably higher than the national jobless rate. We asked Brown&#39;s office where the figure came from.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey referred us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose monthly Current Population Survey provides official statistics on employment and unemployment in the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bureau collects data about veterans, in tracking various segments of the workforce, and last October it updated a detailed report on the employment situation of veterans in 2010, the latest figures available. Among the findings:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe jobless rate for veterans of all eras combined was 8.7 percent in 2010, slightly lower than the 9.4 percent for non-veterans.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe unemployment rate for veterans who served in the military at any time since September 2001 -- a group referred to as Gulf War-era II veterans -- was 11.5 percent.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tYoung male veterans, or those ages 18 to 24, had an unemployment rate of 21.9 percent.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that the BLS considered that 21.9 percent rate as &quot;not statistically different from the jobless rate of young male non-veterans,&quot; which was 19.7 percent. But Brown wasn&rsquo;t citing the statistic to contrast it with the unemployment of non veterans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRather, he used the GrafTech appearance and the statistic to argue that the country owes it to service members to help them transition back to civilian life.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Service members who risk their lives protecting our nation shouldn&rsquo;t have to wonder whether or not they&rsquo;ll be able to find a job when they leave the service,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Just as we invest in our service members while they&rsquo;re on the battlefield, we should do the same when they return home.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown accurately cited the jobless rate for younger veterans. That the non-veteran rate is also high is a piece of additional information that helps provide a clearer picture of the unemployment rate for all younger men.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Brown&rsquo;s claim rates Mostly True.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-22T16:26:39.380413", "ruling_date": "2012-01-23T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sherrod Brown says unemployment among young vets tops 20 percent", "ruling_headline_slug": "sherrod-brown-says-unemployment-among-young-vets-t", "ruling_link_text": "Rate is high for all young men", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSen.
