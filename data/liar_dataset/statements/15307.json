(Novus Ordo Seclorum is inscribed in the <a href=\"https://www.uscurrency.gov/denominations/1\">$1 bill</a>. The U.S. State Department translates the Latin text to &quot;<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf\">A new order of the ages</a>.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along,&quot; the post claimed, adding that along with two islands due east of Virginia in international waters, there also are &quot;massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also claims Obama is holding &quot;secret meetings&quot; with bipartisan officials and diplomats from around the world &quot;in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That part of the story reminded us of another hoax claiming Obama was trying to take down President Donald Trump by establishing a shadow government outside the White House.

A reply said &quot;Google.&quot; But there&rsquo;s no credible information backing Newsfeed USA&rsquo;s story. If there was any merit to the claim, it would have been in national and international headlines of legitimate news sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsfeed USA&rsquo;s post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
