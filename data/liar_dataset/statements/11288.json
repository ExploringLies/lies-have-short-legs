One was about a so-called single-payer health care system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The interesting this is, I&#39;m not the guy who&#39;s saying we should have completely socialized medicine,&quot; Ribble said Sept. 8, 2015 on WTMJ-AM (620).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I want to repeal Obamacare and replace it with (a) free-market system. He wants to replace it with a single-payer system. That&#39;s hardly a conservative posture.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes Trump&#39;s positions can seem to be a moving target; and whether they are conservative can be open to interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But does Trump want to install a single-payer health care system?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twice in the past two months our colleagues have reviewed claims similar to Ribble&#39;s. So let&#39;s start there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First True</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2015, conservative columnist Erick Erickson wrote that Trump &quot;has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our partners at PunditFact.com issued a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/24/erick-erickson/conservative-columnist-trump-once-backed-single-pa/\">rating of True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999, during his short-lived 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump told CNN&#39;s Larry King: &quot;If you can&rsquo;t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it&rsquo;s all over. ... I believe in universal healthcare.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in his 2000 book &quot;The America We Deserve,&quot; Trump made a strong pitch for universal health care. As to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Trump has supported single payer in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Then Half True</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Aug. 2, 2015, GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, said Trump is &quot;for single-payer&quot; -- essentially a present-tense version of the columnist&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our colleagues found that earlier in 2015, Trump voiced admiration for Scotland&rsquo;s health care system, which is single payer. But in another interview -- while stopping short of rejecting single payer -- he talked about offering private plans made through &quot;deals with hospitals&quot; that allow the government to help people &quot;at the lower levels.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson for Trump insisted at the time that Trump has &quot;never supported socialized medicine,&quot; but is for &quot;a universal &lsquo;market-based&rsquo; plan that would offer a range of choices.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So as the 2016 campaign unfolded, Trump has said he admires single payer, but also suggested he prefers free-market models, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National&rsquo;s rating of Perry&rsquo;s claim was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/02/rick-perry/donald-trump-still-single-payer-health-care/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two fact checks were what Ribble&rsquo;s office cited to us to back Ribble&rsquo;s claim. (Trump&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t reply to us.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump has since had more to say on the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Then what?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days after the more recent fact check, Trump was asked on MSNBC&rsquo;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; talk show: &quot;Are you for single-payer health care?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umhvoY0nX88&amp;feature=youtu.be\">replied</a>: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, but it&rsquo;s certainly something that in certain countries works. It actually works incredibly well in Scotland. Some people think it really works in Canada. But not here, I don&rsquo;t think it would work as well here. What has to happen -- I like the concept of private enterprise coming in &hellip;.You have to create competition. And you have to go back to a system of private.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The no part of Trump&rsquo;s answer, even as he repeated praise for single payer, seemed to indicate Trump does not favor it for the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he has since been less clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, at the first Republican presidential debate on April 6, 2015, Fox News host Bret Baier <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zFRjExsfTk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">asked Trump</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren&rsquo;t you for it now?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump answered first by speaking about foreign policy, then said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What I&rsquo;d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state &hellip;..Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can&rsquo;t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, a mixed bag: praising single payer, but advocating, if vaguely, for a private system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, Trump essentially gave no answer when conservative talk show host Sean Hannity asked him about single payer on Hannity&rsquo;s Sept. 1, 2015 radio program. After covering other topics, Trump replied by <a href=\"http://www.hannity.com/articles/shows-472046/radio-show-recap-sep-1-13910544/\">saying</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As far as single-payer and all &mdash; there&rsquo;s so many different things you could have. Honestly, Sean, to do, to have great health insurance. The one thing I do tell people, we&rsquo;re going to have something great. We&rsquo;re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ribble said Trump &quot;wants to replace&quot; Obamacare &quot;with a single-payer system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump continues to praise single payer -- a health care system in which the government pays for care for all citizens -- at least as it used in other countries. But he has spoken a number of times, if vaguely, about a private system and at one point said he does not support single payer in the United States. Since then, his responses have been less clear. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Ribble&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-10T16:25:37.302011", "ruling_date": "2015-09-11T07:24:42", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump wants to replace Obamacare with a single-payer health care system, GOP congressman says", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-wants-replace-obamacare-single-payer-", "ruling_link_text": "Praises single payer, but doesn't pledge to pursue it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WTMJ-AM, Charlie Sykes <a href=\"http://www.620wtmj.com/podcasts/talk/charliesykes/325739641.html\">interview</a> (quote at 21:30) of U.S. Rep.
