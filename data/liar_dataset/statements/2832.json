Tim Ryan&#39;s campaign boasts that the Niles Democrat &quot;has secured a grand total of $116,838,763 to date and has an additional $27,095,000 pending in Fiscal Year 2010 spending bills.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;That means more money to help promote economic growth, strengthen America&rsquo;s infrastructure and improve the quality of life in the Mahoning Valley,&quot; the statement adds, with an exclamation point.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tMore than $143 million is a lot of kapusta, or cabbage, as they might say in the valley.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio asked Ryan&rsquo;s staff to back up the figures, and the congressman&#39;s communications director, Heather McMahon, said they were actually outdated and understated.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tShe said that appropriations for the 17th District, &quot;as secured by Congressman Tim Ryan in his eight years in office,&quot; total $140,133,763 -- with an additional $40,200,000 pending in the Fiscal Year 2011 budget.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAnd, she said, &quot;The figures do not include other grants and funds that Congressman Ryan has assisted in bringing to the 17th District&quot; -- notably a $20 million Department of Transportation grant signed last summer for the Kent Central Gateway project.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tSaying that Ryan has &quot;secured&quot; funding &quot;means that the congressman submitted each project to the appropriate subcommittee as a piece of congressionally directed spending that has been attached to his name,&quot; McMahon said. &quot;Projects that receive funding must be approved by subcommittee, the House appropriations committee, and also the full House.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThe directed appropriations she is describing are better known as earmarks.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tRyan was well-positioned to secure them as a member since 2006 of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations and as a member of the defense appropriations subcommittee, another key panel. He topped the list of lawmakers who scored the highest dollar amounts in the House&#39;s defense bill for fiscal 2011, according to research by the nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/\">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a> and the newspaper The Hill.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tCritics say earmarks contribute to runaway spending, and contend legislators can improperly use earmarks to enrich themselves. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BlvxLAFoVY\">Ryan&rsquo;s view</a> is that earmarks are a way to direct federal dollars to worthwhile local projects and that they account for a tiny percentage of the federal budget.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tRyan&#39;s office provided an overview of funding he secured in nine budget categories, with example projects. Defense topped the list, with a total of $61,154,000 passed and signed. The money included $17.5 million in earmarks for fiscal 2007, which Ryan inserted into a Defense Department spending bill, for Lockheed Martin&#39;s development in Akron of a high-altitude airship.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 6pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.timryan.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=65%20\">Detailed breakdowns</a> appear on Ryan&#39;s congressional website.
