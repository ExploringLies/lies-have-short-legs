The numbers reflect the amount spent per in-state community college student from Virginia&rsquo;s general fund, which is raised from taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two glitches in McAuliffe&rsquo;s calculation. First, his figures include Richard Bland College, a two-year institution that&rsquo;s not part of the 23-school community college system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second problem was that we could not reproduce McAuliffe&rsquo;s calculations when we did our own math with SCHEV data. That&rsquo;s because not all of McAuliffe&rsquo;s numbers were adjusted to 2012 dollars, as Schwerin said. We learned that the campaign adjusted some of the data to 2014 dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what are the real numbers? We got our own data from SCHEV and set all the figures in 2012 dollars. We found that adjusted general fund spending was about $4,275 per in-state community college student during the 2007-08 school year and $2,583 during the 2011-12 year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a decline of $1,692 per student -- somewhat shy of McAuliffe&rsquo;s $1,908 figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another part of McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement also needs examination. He attributes the reduction to budget cuts, but that&rsquo;s not the entire reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State lawmakers, seeking to keep the budget balanced during and after the Great Recession, cut all major services supported by the general fund: education, health and public service. Appropriations for the community college system for instructional programs fell from $372.5 million for the 2007-08 school year to $316.2 million in 2011-12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the same span, the number of people attending community colleges sharply rose -- from</p>\r\n\r\n<p>101,889 full-time equivalent students during 2007-08 to 129,652 in 2011-12, according to figures from the Virginia Community College System. About 95 percent of the students were Virginia residents, according to Jeffrey Kraus, a spokesman for the system. Much of the increase, he said, was driven by the recession as workers entered community colleges to train for second careers and younger students sought a more affordable higher education than attending a four-year college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So state funding was falling while the student population was rising. The community colleges addressed the strain by raising tuition -- from an average of $2,390 for an in-state student during the 2007-08 school year to $3,556 in 2011-12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we should note that 2011-12 is the latest school year for which SCHEV has firm numbers for the number of people attending community colleges and the state&rsquo;s support for each student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe said budget cuts reduced state spending per in-state community college student by $1,908 between 2008 and 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are mistakes in his calculation that inflate his figure. The actual decline was just shy of $1,700 per student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement attributed the reduction to state budget cuts. That&rsquo;s a plausible contention because the General Assembly, combating an economic turndown, slashed community college funding by 15 percent during the years in question. But that&rsquo;s not the entire story. What McAuliffe didn&rsquo;t mention is that the budget cuts were compounded by a 27 percent increase in enrollment in community colleges and those two events combined to cause the steep drop in per-student funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement needs clarifications but his gist -- that during an era of budget cutting, state funding per community college student significantly shrank -- holds up. We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-27T15:01:00.377137", "ruling_date": "2013-05-28T12:30:00", "ruling_headline": "McAuliffe says state support per community college student has been cut $1,908", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcauliffe-says-state-support-community-college-stu", "ruling_link_text": "Close, but not quite that much", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Terry McAuliffe for Governor, <a href=\"http://terrymcauliffe.com/on-the-issues/education/\">&quot;Education,&quot;</a> accessed May 6, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mails from Josh Schwerin, spokesman for the Terry McAuliffe campaign, May 7-9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail from Jeffrey J.
