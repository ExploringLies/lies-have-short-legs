A website called USA Radio crafted some imaginary thoughts from the incoming American president about the departing president of Ghana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the headline &quot;Donald Trump warns outgoing Ghana President,&quot; the faux article said, &quot;Talking to the <em>New York Times</em>, Trump acknowledged the efforts of John Mahama in defending Africa&rsquo;s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country&rsquo;s elections.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It then continued with this purported quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As an outgoing president, you don&rsquo;t have to implement last-minute policies that will make governance tough for the incoming president. You just have to spend the rest of the days on packing. Reverse those appointments and salary increments immediately.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged this for vetting as part of the social media platform&rsquo;s efforts to stymie fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, there is no <em>New York Times</em> article quoting Trump as saying this, nor did a search of the Nexis news database uncover any time when Trump spoke about Ghana. A search of the ICANN Whois registry failed to identify the website&#39;s operator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the December elections in Ghana drew modest press coverage in the United States, a bit of background is in order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ghana emerged from a military-controlled government&nbsp;in 1992 and since that time has established itself as a stable democracy. Residents of the West African nation went to the polls in early December 2016. Challenger Nana Akufo-Addo defeated the incumbent President Mahama by a million votes. Akufo-Addo took&nbsp;office Jan. 7, 2017, making this the third peaceful handoff from one ruling party to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mahama&rsquo;s administration was marred by charges of corruption, and frequent breakdowns of the electric grid that left homes and businesses in darkness.&nbsp;On top of that,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.afrobarometer.org/countries/ghana-1\">Afrobarometer</a>, an internationally backed public opinion project, found that more Ghanaians trusted Akufo-Addo&#39;s party to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/06/what-will-ghanaians-expect-from-their-new-president/?utm_term=.37d25e118bfe\">control inflation</a> and boost jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The invented quote from Trump referred to Mahama&rsquo;s post-election appointments for several key anti-corruption jobs in the government. The slots had been vacant for over a year and the move sparked pushback from some newly elected lawmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Trump transition team and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fake news website said that Trump had warned the departing president of Ghana to avoid making last-minute job appointments. The article cited a <em>New York Times</em> interview that does not exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-09T17:04:54.111913", "ruling_date": "2017-01-10T10:37:44", "ruling_headline": "No, Trump never called departing Ghanaian president", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-trump-never-called-departing-ghanaian-president", "ruling_link_text": "As fake as it gets", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>USA Radio, <a href=\"http://usa-radio.com/donald-trump-warns-outgoing-ghana-president/\">Donald Trump warns outgoing Ghana President</a>, Jan. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AllAfrica.com, <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201701020292.html\">Ghana: Election 2016 and Ghana&#39;s March Towards a Liberal Democratic Tradition</a>, Jan. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice of America, <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-ndc-election-loss/3664436.html\">Ghana&#39;s NDC Ponders Reasons for Election Loss</a>, Jan. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/06/what-will-ghanaians-expect-from-their-new-president/?utm_term=.37d25e118bfe\">&nbsp;What will Ghanaians expect from their new president?</a>, Jan. 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News24, <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/africas-disputed-elections-20160902-2\">Africa&#39;s disputed elections</a>, Sept. 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Donald Trump warned&nbsp;outgoing Ghana President against last-minute job appointments.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2017-01-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
