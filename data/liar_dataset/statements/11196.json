Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says a law that attempts to stop banks from becoming too big to fail actually ends up making community banks too small to succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first Republican presidential debate, Rubio called for less regulation, lower taxes, and rolling back the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in the wake of the financial crisis in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks,&quot; he said on Aug. 6, 2015, to applause. &quot;Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s comment is a new version of an old Republican <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2015/may/08/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-met-nh-man-who-founded-only-us-ba/\">talking</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-dodd-frank-destroying-community/\">point</a>, so we wanted to take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson for Rubio referred us to a March 2015 <a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_brief/2015/pdf/eb_15-03.pdf\">brief</a> by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond that noted a 41 percent decline in small banks&nbsp;between 2007 and 2013. But that&rsquo;s a smaller category&nbsp;--&nbsp;not small and mid-size, as Rubio said --&nbsp;and it starts counting before Dodd-Frank became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we focus on the time frame he gives, 2010 to now, Rubio&rsquo;s figure is overstated. Since 2010, the decline in their numbers is less than half of what Rubio said -- estimates range from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/10/rubios-fantasy-figure-on-bank-closures-due-to-dodd-frank/\">12</a> percent to <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/08/factchecking-the-gop-debate-late-edition/\">16</a> percent. Still, regulators say that&rsquo;s not the full picture, and experts contend that a host of factors other than Dodd-Frank are at play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A 30-year trend</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s note that Dodd-Frank was billed as a safeguard against another financial crisis -- &quot;the most far reaching Wall Street reform in history,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/economy/middle-class/dodd-frank-wall-street-reform\">touts</a> the White House -- and its regulations largely target big banks. So how did mom-and-pop bankers get hit in the crossfire? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the shift, we have to look decades before Rubio&rsquo;s time frame. The number of banks actually began to dwindle in 1980s, as seen in a <a href=\"https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=249382#\">chart</a> from the Federal Bank of St. Louis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/graph-landing.php?g=1dIc\" style=\"overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:475px;\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart of the matter is <em>why </em>the numbers are going down. According to a 2012 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/CBSI-2.pdf\">report</a>, the majority of the loss comes from consolidation, not closures. In other words, banks were not so much collapsing for good as folding into other banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was possible thanks to a slew of laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s that chipped away barriers in banking across communities and state borders (the U.S. Government Accountability Office <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648210.pdf\">points to</a>, for example, the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 and the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So big banks grew bigger, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean all small banks disappeared. Community banks of different sizes have been subject to different trends. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1985 to 2013, the number of the smallest institutions has declined dramatically (85 percent to be exact). But mid-size and large community banks have remained relatively stable since 2010 (and have <em>increased</em>, albeit incrementally, since 1985).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are two FDIC charts from a <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/quarterly/2014_vol8_2/article.pdf\">2014 report</a> to that point:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ALPmL9VPLU3zaj2SsrvCzJbkRu4nvg4hl0Nk6qhryLIPxBh7ERLrdXtlryTaDGG3dEE42SQY_fgNzzE34P0syUZ3X77ahPfrLFTxKAf2RyJA56Pp7bQ1LQsxj4Jb2oLct2Mi75LU\" style=\"border:none; height:252px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two-thirds of failed or voluntarily closed community banks are actually acquired by other community banks, <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/quarterly/2014_vol8_2/article.pdf\">according to the FDIC</a>. The result: fewer, but larger community banks. Their goal: to achieve &quot;economies of scale&quot; (cost advantages gained when spreading out expenses over more revenue), says the <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648210.pdf\">U.S. Government Accountability Office</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So community banks have an incentive to grow bigger, because they then get more bang for their buck, explains Joe Rizzi, a banking consultant and American Banker columnist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dodd-Frank&rsquo;s impact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for how Dodd-Frank plays into all of this, there&rsquo;s really no consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/74695/1687293/version/1/file/Final_State_and_Fate_Lux_Greene.pdf\">February 2015 report</a> by the Harvard Kennedy School, &quot;Dodd-Frank exacerbated the pre-existing trend of banking consolidation by piling up regulatory costs&quot; on community banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It gets so expensive. The people who can really afford the experts and the simple costs are the larger banks,&quot; report co-author Marshall Lux told PolitiFact. &quot;The larger banks are ironically protected from other people entering the market.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rizzi emphasized that the decline in the number of community banks came well before 2010. He attributes the change, instead, to the 30-year consolidation trend as well as the FDIC changing its policies on new banks in 2009. Moreover, he contends that fewer small community banks isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a healthy development. It is better to have fewer sub-scale weak institutions and more stronger banks,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lux and his co-author Robert Greene, however, envision a domino&rsquo;s effect that mostly hits rural and densely populated communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a difference between market-driven consolidation and regulatory-driven consolidation. That leaves gaps. It&rsquo;s not like a competitor is filling the void,&quot; Greene said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The community banks consolidate into mini-regionals and God knows, you&rsquo;re then worried about the big banks swallowing those up,&quot; added Lux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Back to Rubio</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their disagreement on Dodd-Frank&rsquo;s culpability, no one backed Rubio&rsquo;s claim or his call to repeal the law. Lux, whose report was also cited by Rubio&rsquo;s campaign, told the <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Fact Checker that the senator is &quot;simply wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rizzi put it more harshly: &quot;Trying to blame Dodd-Frank for the &lsquo;decline&rsquo; &nbsp;-- I call it change -- in number of community banks is fantasy. Trying to maintain the number and size of community banks is nostalgia. George Bailey (<em>It&#39;s a Wonderful Life</em>) is dead -- let him rest in peace.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lux, for his part, advocated for reform rather than a complete overhaul of Dodd-Frank. After all, the law&rsquo;s primary goal is to tackle &quot;too big to fail.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said, &quot;Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s figure is overstated for the time frame he gives. The highest estimate we found shows a 16 percent decline in the past five years -- less than half of what he said. The trend Rubio describes began decades before Dodd-Frank became law in 2010. Even then, experts say a host of factors other than Dodd-Frank are at play. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-12T15:27:12.296088",
