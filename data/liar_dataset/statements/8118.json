Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE8rKIoUfM\"><u>response to one of Obama&rsquo;s Saturday radio addresses</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the past, most new jobs were full time, but, this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time,&quot; Collins said. &quot;Under this troubling trend, more workers will find their hours and their earnings reduced. Jobs will be lost. This is especially disturbing as our country is still battling high unemployment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4328623\"><u>comment</u></a> we will check separately is by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers: &quot;Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Collins, we looked at the change in full-time and part-time employment between December 2012 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment.

We think a 3-to-1 ratio qualifies as &quot;overwhelming.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we will offer a few caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>A large majority of these jobs are being taken by people who want to work part time</strong>. BLS breaks part-time jobs into two categories -- people working part-time for economic reasons (meaning they want a full-time job, but have to settle for a part-time job), and people working part-time for noneconomic reasons (because they prefer a part-time schedule to a full-time schedule).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Date</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Part time for economic reasons</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Part time for noneconomic reasons</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Dec. 2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>7,918,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>18,763,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>July 2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>8,245,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>19,128,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, about 70 percent of people working part time right now are doing so because they want to work part time, not because the economy is forcing them to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean there are no problems associated with a rise in part-time jobs -- such a shift could make it harder for the recovery to gain momentum, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Still, it&rsquo;s important to point out that most people taking part-time jobs aren&rsquo;t being forced into those jobs purely because of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Timing matters</strong>. If you use a longer time horizon, a large percentage of jobs created were full-time positions. &quot;Over longer periods, a much smaller percentage of job gains have taken the form of part-time jobs,&quot; said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collins said, &quot;This year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time.&quot; The statistics show that 77 percent of the increase in jobs between December 2012 and July 2013 consisted of part-time jobs. It&rsquo;s worth noting that longer time frames show the opposite pattern, and that most of the part-time jobs being created are being taken by people who actually want to work part time. Still, on the numbers, Collins is right, and we rate her claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-06T14:11:11.908104", "ruling_date": "2013-08-07T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Susan Collins says this year, 'overwhelming majority' of new jobs are part time", "ruling_headline_slug": "susan-collins-says-year-overwhelming-majority-new-", "ruling_link_text": "For that period, yes, though not always the case", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Susan Collins, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4329176\"><u>Republican response to President Barack Obama&#39;s Weekly radio address</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TE8rKIoUfM\"><u>Aug. 3, 2013</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea06.htm\"><u>Table A-6.
