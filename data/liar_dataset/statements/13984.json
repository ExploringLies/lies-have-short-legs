His comments <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37981572\">precipitated some concern</a> among the United States&rsquo; allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But months later, during an April 12, 2017, press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump affirmed the United States&rsquo; commitment to the alliance and praised its seven-decade history. He said NATO is now doing more to fight terrorism, and as a result he no longer thinks the organization is obsolete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The secretary general and I had a productive conversation about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change. Now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. It&rsquo;s no longer obsolete.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a big departure from comments he made on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-sen-bernie-sanders/story?id=37949498\">ABC in March 2016</a>: &quot;I think NATO&#39;s obsolete. NATO was done at a time you had the Soviet Union, which was obviously larger, much larger than Russia is today. I&#39;m not saying Russia&#39;s not a threat. But we have other threats. We have the threat of terrorism and NATO doesn&rsquo;t discuss terrorism, NATO&#39;s not meant for terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the premise leading to Trump&rsquo;s change of heart &mdash; the idea that he prompted NATO to start fighting terrorism &mdash; is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaracterizes-nato-change-and-his-/\">false</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s talking about the fact that in 2016 NATO created an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Experts said the change was not especially significant, and Trump wasn&rsquo;t the catalyst. The development had been in the works for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign,&quot; said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center, in a prior <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaracterizes-nato-change-and-his-/\">PolitiFact interview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Trump&rsquo;s comment gives the incorrect impression that NATO wasn&rsquo;t responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. In reality, NATO has been actively dealing with terrorism since the 1980s. And since 9/11, it has played a significant role in the War on Terror, including deploying troops in Afghanistan for more than a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note, though, that experts also told us that NATO&rsquo;s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counterterrorism because of problems with coordinating among the member countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before the election was over, Trump <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaracterizes-nato-change-and-his-/\">hinted</a> that he thinks NATO is making itself more relevant in the fight against terrorism. But at the April press conference he made his change in opinion clear, saying, &quot;I said it was obsolete. It&#39;s no longer obsolete.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s up to voters to decide how they feel about Trump&rsquo;s reversal on NATO. We rate the change of position a Full Flop.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-12T17:27:11.285313", "ruling_date": "2017-04-12T17:41:38", "ruling_headline": " Donald Trump changes NATO position: 'It's no longer obsolete'", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-nato-i-said-it-was-obsolete-its-no-lo", "ruling_link_text": "Reason for flip-flopping is suspect", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House, Trump and Stoltenberg joint press conference, April 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/19/donald-trump/fact-check-donald-trump-says-germany-owes-vast-sum/\">Fact-check: Donald Trump says Germany owes &#39;vast sums of money to NATO,&#39;</a> &quot; March 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-mischaracterizes-nato-change-and-his-/\">Donald Trump mischaracterizes NATO change and his role in it</a>,&quot; Aug. 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/11/trying-pin-down-what-donald-trump-thinks-about-abo/\">Trying to pin down what Donald Trump thinks about abortion, the minimum wage, taxes, and U.S. debt,</a>&quot; May 11, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>On whether NATO is &quot;obsolete.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press conference", "statement_date": "2017-04-12", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Flip-flop: Trump no longer thinks NATO is obsolete"}
