Right now, we the state, the employer, takes all the hit when the market goes down. And so I think the country will be looking at us . . . &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRhode Island, of course, isn&rsquo;t the only state to wrestle with pension problems. So we wondered: Would Rhode Island be the first in the nation to adopt a hybrid retirement plan?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The facts</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA quick search of the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s archives turned up a story from July 10, 2010, entitled &quot;States Shift to Hybrid Pensions.&rsquo;&rsquo; &nbsp;The article begins: &quot;State governments, one of the last bastions of guaranteed pensions, are increasingly taking a page from 401(k) plans that dominate the private sector.&rsquo;&rsquo; &nbsp;Utah, Michigan, Oregon and Washington, the article states, all have some form of hybrid plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we called <a href=\"http://www.nasra.org/\">The National Association of State Retirement Administrators</a>, a nonprofit membership organization whose members are directors of the nation&rsquo;s public retirement systems. Keith Brainard, the association&rsquo;s research director, provided us with <a href=\"http://www.nasra.org/resources/hybrid%20grid.pdf\">a table that shows that seven states</a> have some form of hybrid plan for public employees. They are: Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Utah. (Michigan offers the hybrid plan only to school employees.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTheir plans, like the one the Chafee administration has proposed for Rhode Island, share two features: a traditional pension with a guaranteed benefit, coupled with a 401(k)-style component that offers a payout tied to investment earnings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called the governor&rsquo;s office, and his spokeswoman, Christine Hunsinger, quickly responded that the governor had &quot;made a mistake.&quot; &nbsp;Rhode Island, she conceded, would not be the first state to adopt a hybrid plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK, so the governor was wrong. Rhode Island didn&rsquo;t come up with the idea first. But we still wondered what was happening elsewhere in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted retirement administrators in other states to find out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt least two states -- Washington and Indiana -- have had hybrid retirement plans since the 1990s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the 1990s stock-market boom, a legislative pension committee in Washington saw an opportunity to &quot;self-fund&quot; a portion of its retirement plan, said Dave Nelsen, legal and legislative services manager for the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe teachers union was the first to endorse the idea, he recalled, and in 1995, a bill &quot;sailed through the legislature&quot; to allow teachers to supplement their traditional pensions with something similar to a 401(k) plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2002, the State of Washington passed its own bill to create a hybrid option for all new public employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndiana enacted legislation in 1998 to allow public employees to invest some of their retirement money in selected bonds and money market funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(The hybrid plan proposed by the Chafee administration is similar to Indiana&rsquo;s, said Brainard, of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio offered a hybrid plan to new state employees and those with less than five years of service in 2003.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOregon followed in 2004; Georgia in 2009; and Michigan (for school employees only) in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUtah last year replaced its traditional defined benefit pensions with 401(k)-style plans for new state and municipal workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chafee administration&rsquo;s proposal could, however, set Rhode Island apart from other states in one respect, Brainard said: it would require not just new hires but also most <em>existing employees</em> (except judges, state police, correctional officers and municipal police and firefighters) to participate in the hybrid plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Hunsinger told PolitiFact that was actually what the governor had been told would make Rhode Island &quot;the first in the nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we&rsquo;d caution the governor on that statement, too. We found that at least one other state -- Kansas -- has proposed doing the same.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernor Chafee was clearly wrong when he told state lawmakers that if they approve his administration&rsquo;s pension reforms, Rhode Island would &quot;be the first state in the nation&rsquo;&rsquo; to adopt a hybrid plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese types of plans have been widely publicized in the national media and on the National Association of State Retirement Administrator&rsquo;s web site, and our research found at least seven other states offer hybrid pension plans, some dating back to the 1990s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rule his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
