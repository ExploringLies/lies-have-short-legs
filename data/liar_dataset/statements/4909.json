The two former governors are running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Jim Webb, D-Va., who will not seek reelection next year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen served in the Senate from 2001 to 2007, narrowly losing a reelection bid to Webb. Kaine, during the debate, criticized Allen for consistently supporting Bush administration policies that Kaine said began the federal debt crisis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were curious if the national debt really did increase by $16,000 every second Allen was in the Senate. So we unsheathed our calculators and went to work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen served 2,193 days in the Senate -- from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 4, 2007. That&rsquo;s 189,475,200 seconds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe visited a<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\"> U.S. Department of Treasury website</a> to determine the national debt on each date. Rounding off, it started at $5.72 trillion and ended at $8.67 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a $2.95 trillion increase during Allen&rsquo;s term. The exact figure, if you&rsquo;re interested, is $2,947,358,803,409.45.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means the national debt rose an average $15,555.38 each second Allen was in the Senate. You can reach Kaine&rsquo;s $16,000 estimate by rounding up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s an issue, however, in holding Allen accountable for every appropriation from the day he entered the Senate to the day he left. The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The first spending votes Allen cast in the Senate were for the budget that began Oct. 1, 2001 -- some nine months after he entered office. And the last ones Allen cast were for the budget that ended Sept. 30, 2007 -- almost nine months after he left office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the real period of influence Allen had on federal spending ran from Oct. 1, 2001 to Sept. 30, 2007. The national debt rose by $3.202 billion during that span and, as we pointed out in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/jan/23/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-debt-grew-16000-every-second-geo/\">Truth-O-Meter</a> earlier this year, Allen voted for each of about four dozen appropriation bills that came to the Senate floor during his term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 every second he was in the Senate. That&rsquo;s slightly higher than Kaine&rsquo;s estimate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut before you get angry at Allen, consider this: The debt has increased by $48,994.13 a second since Barack Obama became president. And Kaine, who served as Obama&rsquo;s hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee for two years before resigning in April, is a staunch defender of the president.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaine says the national debt increased by $16,000 every second Allen served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe actual number, from the day Allen entered the Senate to the day he left, is $15,555.38 per second. Kaine reasonably rounded up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 a second.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Kaine&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-08T12:52:59.860713", "ruling_date": "2011-12-08T12:49:40", "ruling_headline": "Tim Kaine says debt grew by $16,000 every second of George Allen's senate term", "ruling_headline_slug": "time-kaine-says-debt-grew-16000-every-second-georg", "ruling_link_text": "Reasonable estimate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTim Kaine, U.S. Senate debate, Dec. 7, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreasuryDirect,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTHOMAS,<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/home/approp/app11.html\">Appropriation Bills</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/jan/23/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-debt-grew-16000-every-second-geo/\">Jamie Radtke says debt grew by $16,000 every second of Allen&rsquo;s term</a>, Jan. 23, 2011.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Tim", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 424, "last_name": "Kaine", "mostly_true_count": 15, "name_slug": "tim-kaine", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_NCCB111_CAMPAIGN_2016_KA.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/424/", "total_count": 57, "true_count": 12, "website": "http://www.kaine.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe national debt increased $16,000 every second&nbsp;George Allen served in the&nbsp;U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate.", "statement_date": "2011-12-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
