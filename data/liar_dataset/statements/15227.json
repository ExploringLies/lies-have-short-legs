Chuck Schumer&rsquo;s op-ed about voting rights and twisted it to state that he supported allowing non-citizens to vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Chuck Schumer slams President Trump: &lsquo;it&rsquo;s racist to only allow citizens to vote,&quot; said an April 3 headline on <a href=\"http://federernow.blogspot.com/2018/04/chuck-schumer-slams-president-trump-its.html\">Federer Now</a>, a right-wing blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that the story, which appeared to be lifted from <a href=\"https://viralnewspolitical.com/chuck-schumer-slams-president-trump-its-racist-to-only-allow-citizens-to-vote/\">other </a>websites, distorted what Schumer actually said about voting rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While readers of the blog could assume that the statements by Schumer were recent, they actually came from his Aug. 24, 2017, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@SenSchumer/after-charlottesville-its-time-to-end-the-assault-on-voting-rights-2afe5134097f\">Medium post</a> in which he called on Trump to disband his Election Integrity Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump formed the commission in 2017 in an effort to ferret out voter fraud which <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-large-scale-voter-f/\">Trump portrayed as &quot;large scale</a>,&quot; even though national experts have said fraud is isolated and rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/05/donald-trump/trump-blames-democratic-states-providing-voter-d/\">disbanded the commission</a> in January 2018 after pushback from many states, infighting on the commission and multiple lawsuits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federer Now blog plucked some actual quotes by Schumer from his Medium post including this one: &quot;If the president wants to truly show that he rejects the discrimination agenda of the white supremacist movement, he will rescind the Executive Order that created this commission.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then the blog made some declarations about Schumer&rsquo;s opinions, which were not rooted in fact. For example it said that Schumer &quot;has declared restricting voting to only Americans as an exercise in racism. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer&rsquo;s Medium post made no mention of restricting voting to citizens. The point of Schumer&rsquo;s op-ed was to argue that voting rights are &quot;under assault&quot; by Trump and many states and that such laws are racist and an effort to disenfranchise minority voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer described Trump&rsquo;s Election Integrity Commission as an &quot;effort to intimidate voters and purge them from the rolls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer spokesman Matt House told PolitiFact that Schumer hasn&rsquo;t called for allowing non-citizens to vote. Only citizens can generally vote in elections, although a few local governments have allowed <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/sep/15/adam-putnam/san-francisco-takoma-park-noncitizens-elections/\">non-citizens to vote in local elections</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-05T14:36:17.924549", "ruling_date": "2018-04-05T14:36:10", "ruling_headline": "No, Chuck Schumer didn't say it is racist to only allow citizens to vote ", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-chuck-schumer-didnt-say-it-racist-only-allow-ci", "ruling_link_text": "Distorted his comments", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Federer Now, <a href=\"http://federernow.blogspot.com/2018/04/chuck-schumer-slams-president-trump-its.html\">&quot;Chuck Schumer SLAMS President Trump : &quot;It&rsquo;s Racist To Only Allow Citizens To Vote,&quot; </a>April 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viral News Political, <a href=\"https://viralnewspolitical.com/chuck-schumer-slams-president-trump-its-racist-to-only-allow-citizens-to-vote/\">&quot;Chuck Schumer SLAMS President Trump : &quot;It&rsquo;s Racist To Only Allow Citizens To Vote,&quot;</a> Feb. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium Post by U.S. Sen.
