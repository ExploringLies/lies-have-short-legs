<a href=\"https://smartmindmag.com/nasa-has-just-confirmed-earth-has-a-new-moon/\">the website claimed</a>. &quot;The new moon isn&rsquo;t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not quite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post heavily borrows from a June 2016 NASA report but takes liberties to stretch the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NASA in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6537\">announced</a> the discovery of a small asteroid which as it orbits the sun, &quot;appears to circle around Earth as well.&quot; But NASA did not say that the asteroid, labeled 2016 HO3, was a new moon orbiting Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is too distant to be considered a true satellite of our planet, but it is the best and most stable example to date of a near-Earth companion, or &lsquo;quasi-satellite&rsquo;,&quot; the NASA report said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A satellite is an object that moves around a larger object, and both the Earth and the moon are considered &quot;natural&quot; satellites, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-satellite-k4.html\">NASA explains</a>. 2016 HO3&rsquo;s characteristics only elevate it to &quot;quasi-satellite.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The smartmindmag.com post included legitimate quotes that appear on NASA&rsquo;s 2016 post, but jumped to a conclusion that NASA did not establish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the NASA report and smartmindmag.com quote Paul Chodas, manager of NASA&#39;s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., as saying: &quot;Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other more prominent news outlets ran similar headlines in 2016 about Earth having two moons, based on NASA&rsquo;s report. Business Insider: <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/earth-has-two-moons-2016-6\">SURPRISE: Earth has two moons</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But other websites covered the story more accurately.
