Nationally, according to the report, black-white unemployment disparities were greatest in Wisconsin (the black jobless rate was 4.6 times the white rate), and Minnesota (the black rate was 3.7 times the white rate).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another chart in the report indicates median hourly wages of Texas whites and Hispanics increased 8 and 2.9 percent, respectively, from 2000 to 2014 while median hourly wages of black Texans decreased 0.8 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if blacks saw falling wages by this measure all through those years. They did not: To our inquiry, the Economic Policy Institute provided year-by-year data showing the hourly median for black Texans decreased in six years while going up in eight years. Through the period, the real median wage for Texas African Americans bottomed out at $13.61 in 2008. It crested at $15.18 in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationally at the end of the 15-year period, median real wages of African-American workers were down even more than in Texas alone, according to the report. That is, the national median real hourly wage for African Americans in 2014 was $13.97, about 3 percent less than the comparable median of $14.41 in 2000. Also, according to the report, other states had bigger differences between the first and last years studied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"chart1.jpg.png\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xXymSPWB7U6hXJEhVgpcZtzx1BDjO0elqw_D3obg7ziBF73IB7C8EWEBjFcVrQAu_aXzVH-F4gp80wSSXJYYn7cD-OrDn7RkmIh5v-JoBwrJD53vNgZR1jKXacFA_mhQZyRv87c\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:395px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:585px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=\"http://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/FedUp%20Report%2003022015%20web.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Report</u></a><em>, &quot;Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Full-Employment Mandate,&quot; &nbsp;Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015 </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"chart2.jpg.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZJ-_JtnFAvwykSaABCT65it1kiLoJToXSgZbbWoh5ddTIlAPRgIusrH2FgIz2Ib6gm736hFNwbyGXdYLt_IaSHJvrmohFavOM9TYVzyyhDes2uTUy3B_7WYzzpVgVCYNIIp8HZE\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:424px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:557px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=\"http://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/FedUp%20Report%2003022015%20web.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Report</u></a><em>, &quot;Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Full-Employment Mandate,&quot; &nbsp;Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015 </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And why?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Missing from the report: Why the differences between black workers and others?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we called to ask about that, Ady Barkan, a center official, suggested multiple longstanding factors including racism and differences between blacks and whites in education levels and rates of incarceration. By email, Barkan also pointed out a <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/labor/report/2011/07/25/9992/the-black-and-white-labor-gap-in-america/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>July 2011 issue paper</u></a> from the liberal Center for American Progress noting, among reasons, that in each of the latest U.S. recessions, blacks were most often the first employees fired and the last ones hired (once each recession was ending).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the Economic Policy Institute why black unemployment in Texas appeared to be running<strong> </strong>higher than white and Hispanic unemployment. Josh Bivens,<strong> </strong>director of research and policy, said by email this may be because of discrimination in the labor market and pre-labor market. And what&rsquo;s the &quot;pre-labor&quot; market? Bivens said residential segregation can lead to blacks going to<strong> </strong>lower-quality primary and secondary schools, potentially resulting in lower levels of educational achievement and less lucrative jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also sought an explanation of the cited differences from Chris King, director of the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources at the University of Texas. By email, King said labor economists would &nbsp;explain higher unemployment among blacks/African Americans nationally by pointing out that African Americans tend to have lower levels of education and be employed in lower-paying occupations and industries than whites. King elaborated by pointing out Bureau of Labor Statistics data covering 2011 showing black men more likely to work in service, production, transportation and &quot;material moving&quot; jobs. Conversely, he wrote, black men were less likely to work in professional and managerial jobs than whites; the picture was similar, he said, for black women.
