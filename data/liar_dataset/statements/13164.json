Photo by&nbsp;Jae C. Hong / Associated Press</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prop 67 is a referendum on a law Gov. Jerry Brown signed two years ago banning plastic carryout bags statewide. The plastics industry challenged it, placing the law on hold. The measure is also known as the &quot;California Plastic Bag Ban Veto Referendum.&quot; It would apply to grocery and&nbsp;convenience stores, large pharmacies&nbsp;and liquor stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably, the No on 67 campaign uses the word &quot;tax&quot; rather than charge or fee in its claim. The term doesn&rsquo;t fit, as the revenue goes to stores, not a government agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the No on 67 campaign said its claim is backed up by the text of the ballot measure, which says the 10 cent charge (it doesn&rsquo;t use the term &lsquo;tax&rsquo;) would be &quot;retained by the store and &hellip; used only for specified purposes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=67&amp;year=2016\">examined Prop 67</a> and found &quot;stores would retain the revenue from the sale of the bags.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It went on to say: &quot;They could use the proceeds to cover the costs of providing carryout bags, complying with the measure, and educational efforts to encourage the use of reusable bags.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for the Yes on 67 campaign, acknowledged there&rsquo;s no requirement for stores to fund beach cleanups, land preservation or similar environmental efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no environmental upside to the 10 cent charge, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The environmental benefit of charging for the actual average cost of bags (versus) giving those bags for free, is that consumers use substantially fewer bags,&quot; Maviglio said in an email. &quot;Fewer bags, even fewer recycled paper bags, means a smaller environmental footprint.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed to a <a href=\"http://www3.sanjoseca.gov/clerk/CommitteeAgenda/TE/20121203/TE20121203_d5.pdf\">2012 report by the city of San Jose</a> to back up that statement. San Jose is among the <a href=\"http://www.cawrecycles.org/list-of-local-bag-bans/\">more than 100</a> cities or counties in California that already ban plastic grocery bags. The city&rsquo;s plastic bag ordinance includes a 10 cent charge on paper bags retained by stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing periods before and after the ban, the report found an 89 percent reduction in bag litter in San Jose&rsquo;s storm drain system; and about a 60 percent reduction in the city&rsquo;s creeks, rivers, streets and neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Santa Cruz County, Laura Kasa of Save our Shores <a href=\"http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/ZZ/20130616/NEWS/130617908\">told the Santa Cruz Sentinel</a> in 2013 her group has witnessed a reduction of bags collected during cleanups &quot;because of the four bans which took effect (in the county) in 2012.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The No on 67 campaign claims &quot;Not one penny of the bag ban tax goes to the environment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large portion of this is correct: Nothing requires the bag fee revenue be spent directly on environmental causes, as found by the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the claim ignores the indirect benefit the fee could have on the environment. Supporters make a fair point that the fee will persuade customers to use reusable bags, thus cutting down on river- and creek-choking plastic bags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the No on 67 statement describes the fee as a &quot;tax,&quot; a wrong and misleading description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>HALF TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> more </a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>UPDATE: After this fact check was published, a spokeswoman for the city of San Jose&nbsp;told us that the city&#39;s estimate of 89 percent litter reduction was later determined to be miscalculated. The corrected estimate&nbsp;is 62 percent.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bdcb9c8a-1a47-4ed7-8204-61e175e619ec\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bdcb9c8a-1a47-4ed7-8204-61e175e619ec</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-29T20:05:34.481071", "ruling_date": "2016-10-03T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "What\u2019s in the Calif. bag fee for the environment?
