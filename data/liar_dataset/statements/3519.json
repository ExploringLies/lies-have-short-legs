All are groups with lower rates of having government-issued IDs, several national studies have found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill&#39;s sponsor, Rep. Bob Mecklenborg of Cincinnati, pointed to totals in Georgia that showed an increase in voting among all racial groups following adoption of a voter ID law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The African-American vote in Georgia has increased dramatically -- five times the amount of the white vote,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Had there been a contrary result, we might have taken a different position on the bill,&quot; House Speaker William G. Batchelder said March 23 at a news conference. &quot;Had this dissuaded black voters from participating, we might have taken a totally different look at it. It hasn&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t, and apparently, if you do cause and effect in that state, it&#39;s been helpful.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio decided to take a closer look at the speaker&#39;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe voting numbers from Georgia -- where photo ID for in-person voting was first required in September 2007 -- came from Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who testified in Columbus for the Ohio bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKemp said the Latino vote in Georgia increased from 18,000 in 2004 to 43,000 in 2008, an increase of 140 percent; the African-American vote increased from 834,000 in 2004 to 1.2 million in 2008, an increase of 42 percent; and the white vote increased from 2.3 million in 2004 to 2.5 million in 2008, an increase of 8 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tComparing the non-presidential years of 2006 and 2010, the Latino vote increased 66 percent, African-American participation increased 44 percent, and white voting rose almost 12 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWas the photo ID requirement the cause of the increase, as Batchelder suggested?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBatchelder&#39;s office didn&#39;t get back to us. We put the question to William Minozzi, an assistant professor of political science at Ohio State University, who examined the effects of voter ID in a study published last fall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Correlation does not imply causation,&quot; he said. Georgia&#39;s increased voter participation is &quot;the result of a lot of different things. I think you could call this cherry-picking.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s an obviously specious argument,&quot; said law professor Daniel Tokaji, associate director of Ohio State University&#39;s Election Law @ Moritz project, who testified against the photo-ID bill. &quot;A lot of things affect turnout. The last two election cycles are ones in which the Democratic base has been extraordinarily motivated.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth Minozzi and Tokaji cited the candidacy of Barack Obama, whose voter-registration drive in 2008 was called the largest in the history of presidential campaigns. The drive&#39;s biggest announced goal was in Georgia, where it aimed to register and turn out 500,000 unregistered African-American voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe actual increase from 2004 was 466,000, according to the secretary of state&#39;s office, which cited its own outreach program to get free ID cards to voters as a factor increasing turnout.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA review of research by the University of Wisconsin, responding to voter-ID legislation proposed in that state this year, noted that some researchers thought that such laws might increase turnout, possibly by increasing voter awareness -- &quot;but we found no research showing that effect.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA study published in the Harvard Law &amp; Policy Review concluded only that outreach programs may counter a decline in turnout it associated with voter ID laws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver all, UW found that &quot;studies of the effect of voter ID laws on voter turnout find no discernible relationship or a small negative impact,&quot; and that &quot;data limitations make these relationships notoriously difficult to estimate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You can&rsquo;t clearly identify the cause and effect,&quot; Minozzi said. &quot;There is not wide evidence for one side or the other.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA recently completed study by University of Georgia political science professor Trey Hood found &quot;credible evidence&quot; that Georgia&#39;s voter ID law did lower turnout among people who lacked government photo IDs before the law took effect, by about one third of a percentage point in 2008 compared to 2004 levels.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, the Hood study found no evidence to suggest there was a racial or ethnic component to the dropoff. In fact, the dropoff happened across all ethnic groups with white voters actually seeing the biggest share of that overall third of a percentage point drop in voting because of the law, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It doesn&#39;t affect minorities disproportionately -- they were impacted the same or slightly less than whites by the law,&quot; said Hood in a phone interview. &quot;From my observation and from my research, it&#39;s sort of a been a wash.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpeaker Batchelder was correct when he said voting increased in Georgia after its photo ID law took effect. Suggesting that the restriction caused the increase is a logical fallacy that ignores important other factors and is unsupported by research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-01T16:51:40.262444", "ruling_date": "2011-04-04T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio House Speaker William G.
