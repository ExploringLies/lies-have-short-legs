PolitiFact National&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/17/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-correct-most-americans-support-legali/\">rating was True</a>, as multiple polls generally showed support in the low 50s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems unlikely that in a few short weeks it would jump to 60 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Previous factcheck</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Johnson made his earlier claim, our colleagues found that in 12 of 14 national polls taken since the start of 2014, 50 percent or more of Americans supported legalization. The information, covering a period of more than 2.5 years, was taken from the <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/drugs.htm\">PollingReport.com database</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the three latest polls in the database, the numbers crept closer to 60 percent, with support at 54 percent, 56 percent and 58 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But averaging the 14 polls, legalization led 53 percent to 44 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another poll</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s campaign, however, pointed us to another relatively recent poll that wasn&rsquo;t included in the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research <a href=\"http://www.apnorc.org/PDFs/Drugs/AP-NORC%20Drugs%20Report%20Topline.pdf\">poll, conducted in February 2016</a>, found that 61 percent of Americans said the use of marijuana should be made legal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Interestingly, 53 percent said marijuana use in their communities was a moderately serious, very serious or extremely serious problem, compared to 45 percent who said it was not at all serious or not too serious.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reporting on the poll, the Washington Post&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/25/support-for-marijuana-legalization-has-hit-an-all-time-high/\">Wonkblog said</a> the 61 percent support, a notch above Johnson&rsquo;s claim, was an all-time high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A parting note, though it doesn&rsquo;t bear on our rating of Johnson&rsquo;s claim about national numbers: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MLSP36ToplinesRV.pdf\">July 2016 poll</a> of registered voters in Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll asked:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to marijuana, some people think that the drug should be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol.
