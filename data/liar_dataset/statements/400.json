John McCain as being the same as President George W. Bush on a number of issues, including\n<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/mar/17/mcsame-ad-goes-three-four/\">\n Iraq, taxes and health care\n</a>\n. It also bashes the two on energy policy.\n<p>\n \"Oil companies, they get tax breaks while we pay at the pump. McSame as Bush,\" the ad states.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Bush administration's signature energy initiative was the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a major piece of legislation that included subsidies and incentives for several sectors of the energy industry, including oil companies. It was the first national energy legislation in more than a decade, and the Bush administration worked for several years to get it passed. We ruled previously that\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/292/\">\n  the bill contained significant measures to encourage clean energy\n </a>\n .\n</p>\n<p>\n To be sure, the bill still had its detractors. Some people felt it included too many incentives for industry and too little to help consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those detractors included McCain.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"This bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country,\" he said in a statement his Senate office issued at the time. \"The handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for the people of Arizona. I cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency, security, and energy independence.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The statement noted that McCain liked the plan's reliability standards and incentives for new refinery capacity, but concluded that the bad outweighed the good.\n</p>\n<p>\n McCain also said he opposed it because it might make pump prices higher with its mandates for the increased use of ethanol.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the final vote on the bill, McCain was one of 26 senators who voted against it. (\n <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/397/\">\n  Hillary Clinton also opposed it while Barack Obama voted for it.\n </a>\n )\r\n\r\nThe McSame ad doesn't mention this legislation specifically, but it was a priority of the Bush administration and a notable source of tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. McCain opposed it. You can't call them the \"McSame\" for such a significant difference. For this reason, we find the statement False.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:20.397744", "ruling_date": "2008-03-17T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "McCain voted against Bush's energy bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "mccain-voted-against-bushs-energy-bill", "ruling_link_text": "McCain voted against Bush's energy bill", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Campaign to Defend America,\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN10_6pyshQ\">\n McSame as Bush\n</a>\n, March 5, 2008\n<p>\n John McCain Senate Web site,\n <a href=\"http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=336b5102-187f-4127-87d8-d721b3fd2769&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=\">\n  McCain, Kyl say no to flawed energy bill\n </a>\n , June 28, 2005\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Senate,\n <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00158\">\n  Final roll call vote on Energy Policy Act of 2005\n </a>\n , June 28, 2005\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Senate,\n <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00213\">\n  Initial roll call vote on Energy Policy Act of 2005\n </a>\n , July 29, 2005\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington Post,\n <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/08/AR2005080800124.html\">\n  Bush Signs Energy Bill, Cheers Steps Toward Self-Sufficiency\n </a>\n , Aug. 9, 2005\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 42, "last_name": "Campaign to Defend America", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "campaign-defend-america", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-cda.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/42/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "Both McCain and Bush favor tax breaks for oil companies.
