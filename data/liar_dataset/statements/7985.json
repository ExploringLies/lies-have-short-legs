This list was familiar until this eye-popper: &quot;He attacked churches for helping the poor,&quot; Begala wrote of Cuccinelli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Begala, a frequent CNN contributor, to prove his claim. He pointed to an <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2012/12/cuccinelli-critical-catholic-approach-poor\">article</a> in The Virginian-Pilot about a Sept. 29, 2012, keynote address that Cuccinelli gave to the Cherish Life Ministries Christian Life Summit in Ashburn, Va.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2012/12/cuccinelli-critical-catholic-approach-poor\">video</a> of Cuccinelli&rsquo;s speech, posted along with the story, certainly shows the attorney general heaping criticism on Catholic church leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One of my great frustrations as a Catholic, present company excepted, is how soft and weak the leadership of my church has been,&quot; Cuccinelli said. &quot;They have for decades lobbied government to do this and to do that -- all of which should be done by the church if they&rsquo;re done at all in society. And so over time they have made themselves out to be nothing but the largest special interest group in America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begala, to support his statement that Cuccinelli &quot;attacked churches for helping the poor,&quot; zeroed in on a comment the Republican made about Catholic bishops:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They&rsquo;ve helped create a culture of dependency on government, not God,&quot; Cuccinelli said, lamenting that bishops were arguing churches &quot;shouldn&rsquo;t be the primary institution in a society that is responsible for service to the poor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that statement doesn&rsquo;t strike us as &quot;an attack on churches for helping the poor.&quot; To the contrary, Cuccinelli was criticizing what he said was an effort by the church to hand off some of its charitable role to government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli stressed that point later in his speech:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Two most important things in human life -- your faith in God and, as between ourselves, love -- and government can do neither, can do neither one,&quot; he said. &quot;And our churches are asking that institution -- and have for decades -- to step up and take on their role.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli made a similar argument in his 2013 book, &quot;The Last Line of Defense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One reason the American people got stuck with Obamacare was due to a devolution in American thinking over time that it was the government&rsquo;s job to provide health care for those who couldn&rsquo;t afford it on their own,&quot; Cuccinelli wrote. &quot;But taking care of the poor is ideally the province first of families, churches and charities, not the government.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note: The Democratic Governors Association, for whom Begala wrote the fundraising letter, is the <a href=\"http://www.vpap.org/candidates/profile/money_in_donors/11897\">largest contributor</a> to Cuccinelli&rsquo;s opponent -- Democrat Terry McAuliffe. It donated <a href=\"http://www.vpap.org/candidates/profile/money_in_details/11897?donor_id=119682\">$2 million</a> to McAuliffe&rsquo;s campaign on May 13, according to records compiled by Virginia Public Access Project. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begala said Cuccinelli &quot;attacked churches for helping the poor,&quot; a statement that suggests the Republican opposes the charitable work done by religious organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a full reading of Cuccinelli&rsquo;s comments show he was saying the opposite: That &nbsp;charitable work should be the responsibility of religious organizations -- not the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Begala&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-07T10:44:09.156418", "ruling_date": "2013-07-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Begala says Cuccinelli \"attacked churches for helping the poor\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "begala-says-cuccinelli-attacked-churches-helping-p", "ruling_link_text": "Uncharitable distortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Daily Kos, <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/06/27/1219318/-VA-Gov-Paul-Begala-Lists-The-Reasons-Why-Ken-Cuccinelli-R-Is-Crazy-Bad-For-Virginia#\">&quot;VA-Gov: Paul Begala lists the reasons why Ken Cuccinelli is crazy and bad for Virginia,&quot;</a> June 27, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail from Paul Begala, July 2, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail from Danny Kanner, director of communications at the Democratic Governor&rsquo;s Association, July 2, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Virginian-Pilot, <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2012/12/cuccinelli-critical-catholic-approach-poor\">&quot;Cuccinelli critical of Catholic approach to poor,&quot;</a> Dec. 13, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think Progress, &quot;<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/12/13/1322311/cuccinelli-church/?mobile=nc\">Virginia gubernatorial candidate blasts Catholic Church for creating &lsquo;a culture of dependency on government, not god,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Dec. 13, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ken Cuccinelli, &quot;The last line of defense,&quot; pages 54-59, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virginia Public Access Project, Contributions to Terry McAuliffe, accessed July 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Affiliated professor of public policy at Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 914, "last_name": "Begala", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "paul-begala", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/begala.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/914/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/begala.paul.html"}, "statement": "<p>Says Ken Cuccinelli &quot;attacked churches for helping the poor.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a fundraising letter.", "statement_date": "2013-06-27", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 9, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/9/", "subject": "Religion", "subject_slug": "religion", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 10, "first_name": "Ken", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 763, "last_name": "Cuccinelli", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "ken-cuccinelli", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Cuccinelli.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/763/", "total_count": 21, "true_count": 3, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
