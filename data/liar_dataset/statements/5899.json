And he offers his record as governor as proof of his commitment to that goal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The research clearly demonstrates high-quality early childhood opportunities help children succeed,&quot; he wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.kaineforva.com/vision_for_our_economic_future\">paper</a> laying out his economic policies. &quot;That&rsquo;s why we expanded participation in Virginia in early childhood programs by nearly 40 percent...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked whether Virginia&rsquo;s early childhood programs really did grow by 40 percent during Kaine&rsquo;s term as governor from 2006 to 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring his gubernatorial campaign, Kaine proposed making Virginia&rsquo;s pre-kindergarten program available to all 4-year-olds -- not just those from families living close to the poverty line. The universal access was estimated to cost $300 million a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce in office, Kaine scaled back that ambition in the face of a recession that eroded state revenues. But he did seek increases preschool programs every year during his term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBudget records show he <a href=\"http://www.dpb.virginia.gov/budget/06-08/buddoc07/partb/07Education.pdf\">proposed</a> an extra $4.6 million for the 2007-08 fiscal year to add 1,250 children to the program. In his full biennial budget, which covered 2008 through 2010, Kaine sought $56 million in additional funding, according to reports. The request was pared to $40 million, then $22 million, as lawmakers sought to cope with the recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver the course of Kaine&rsquo;s term, the Virginia Preschool Initiative saw a steady rise to its annual budget from $46.3 to $58.6 million. (That trend has continued into the recently approved <a href=\"about:blank\">budget</a>, which provided $68.2 million for 2013 and $68.5 million for 2014.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia Preschool Initiative teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line. Children below that line qualify for the federal Head Start program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the 2005-06 school year, when Kaine took office, 11,343 children were enrolled in Virginia&rsquo;s preschool initiative. By the time his term ended, in the 2009-10 school year, the program had 15,901 children. The increase is 40.2 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\tKaine claimed that he was part of expanding participation in early childhood programs in Virginia by nearly 40 percent.
