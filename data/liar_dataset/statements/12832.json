Sherrod Brown took the stage on the final day of the convention in Philadelphia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, who insisted all along that his gig representing Ohio is satisfying enough, delivered a speech that drew contrasts between nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While Trump outsources jobs, Hillary Clinton has a real plan to bring jobs back to America &ndash; like a $10 billion &lsquo;Made in America&rsquo; plan with tax credits to revitalize manufacturing,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Trump proposes tax cuts, too &ndash; $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his. Of course we can&rsquo;t say for sure how much Trump will take for himself, because he&rsquo;s refused to share his tax returns with the American People.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been widely <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4054604/trumps-tax-plan-could-cost-12-trillion-and-save-him-millions-in-taxes-each-year/\">reported </a>that Trump&rsquo;s tax plan generously favors the top one-percent of Americans. We asked Brown&rsquo;s Senate office for his sources of the numbers &quot;$3 trillion&quot; and &quot;$2 trillion.&quot; Trillions tend to sound exaggerated -- maybe because that many zeroes make our eyeballs swim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rachel Petri, from Brown&rsquo;s senate office, offered a piece from Citizens for Tax Justice to back up the claim about Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform\">planned </a>corporate tax cuts. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal think tank, plotted a hypothetical analysis of Trump&rsquo;s proposal, if implemented in 2016. They found that the changes would equal $12 trillion less revenue collected in federal taxes over the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This includes $9.6 trillion in personal income tax cuts, <em>$2 trillion in corporate income tax cuts</em>, and the $300 billion cost of repealing estate and gift taxes,&quot; according to the <a href=\"http://ctj.org/pdf/trumpplan2016.pdf\">report</a> (emphasis ours).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petri said that the $3 trillion for millionaires figure comes from data from the Tax Policy Center, which was <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/4-28-16tax.pdf\">analyzed </a>by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That report estimates that the tax cuts going to millionaires would result in a loss of revenue collected by approximately $3.2 trillion over 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since both groups Brown pulled stats from are liberal-leaning, we looked for a report from a source that skews conservative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One such group, the Tax Foundation, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-s-tax-plan\">reported </a>a cost of $1.54 trillion for Trump&rsquo;s corporate tax cuts over 10 years. Though that is off by half a trillion, rounding up would get it to Brown&rsquo;s $2 trillion quote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tax Foundation estimates $10.2 trillion less revenue over a decade due to reduced individual tax rates. The top one-percent of earners would see 27 percent of the cut under the plan, which is about $2.75&nbsp;trillion.&nbsp;<em>(</em><strong><em>Correction Aug. 2, 2016</em>: </strong><em>An earlier version of this fact-check had a different calculation</em>.<strong>)</strong>&nbsp;Again, rounding up gets it to Brown&rsquo;s $3 trillion under this analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is no longer the presumptive Republican candidate, but this is a presumptive tax plan. In May, Trump <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-taxes-tax-reform-223041\">tapped </a>two all-stars of conservative fiscal policy to help with a revamp. As of yet, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-06-13/less-costly-trump-2-0-tax-plan-urged-by-reagan-era-economists\">Trump Tax 2.0</a> is still pending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing the DNC, Brown said that Trump&rsquo;s tax plan would cut &quot;$3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers basically check out, via Brown&rsquo;s think-tank sources. A conservative group&rsquo;s analysis fell a little shorter, but supports Brown when rounded up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s all subject to change upon the unveiling of Trump&rsquo;s Tax Plan Part Two. But it is accurate as of Brown&rsquo;s speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b1c5101-f92c-4d53-b889-a223ba2ead27\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b1c5101-f92c-4d53-b889-a223ba2ead27</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-01T14:36:37.343194", "ruling_date": "2016-08-01T16:57:02", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
