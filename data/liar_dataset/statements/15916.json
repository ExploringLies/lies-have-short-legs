That was an improvement from 26 percent proficiency in 2015, which was significantly below the national average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s average eighth grade reading score <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile/overview/FL?cti=PgTab_Findings&amp;chort=2&amp;sub=RED&amp;sj=FL&amp;fs=Grade&amp;st=MN&amp;year=2015R3&amp;sg=Gender%3A+Male+vs.+Female&amp;sgv=Difference&amp;ts=Single+Year&amp;tss=2015R3-2015R3&amp;sfj=NP\">improved slightly</a> from 2015 but was not significantly different than the 2017 national average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s fourth grade reading scores <a href=\"https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile/overview/FL?cti=PgTab_Findings&amp;chort=2&amp;sub=RED&amp;sj=FL&amp;fs=Grade&amp;st=MN&amp;year=2015R3&amp;sg=Gender%3A+Male+vs.+Female&amp;sgv=Difference&amp;ts=Single+Year&amp;tss=2015R3-2015R3&amp;sfj=NP\">were above the national average</a>, not the best in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">AP performance</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad additionally claims high school AP classes in Florida are ranked first in the nation.

As more people take AP exams, however, overall success wavers.

Eighth grade reading, first.
