So when he was asked in a combative <em>Today </em>show interview when he would formally announce a campaign for president, the tycoon said he was being respectful of NBC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter all, Trump said, his show <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>is the network&#39;s top-rated show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s the exchange with <em>Today </em>host Meredith Vieira:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Vieira</strong>: &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Trump</strong>: &quot;I hate to say it, I have the No. 1 show on NBC. Is that a correct statement? I mean, <em>The Apprentice</em> is doing great -- <em>The Celebrity Apprentice</em>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Vieira</strong>: &quot;What does that have to do....&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Trump</strong>: &quot;It has a lot to do. It sounds so trivial, and I hate to even bring it up, but I&#39;m not allowed to run during the show. You&#39;re not allowed to have the show on and be a declared candidate. It&rsquo;s a great show and it&rsquo;s got phenomenal ratings, and until that show is over, I can&rsquo;t declare, because otherwise, NBC would have to take the show off the air, and I think that would be very unfair to NBC.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis season&#39;s <em>Celebrity Apprentice </em>is the latest in a long-running NBC reality show that features celebrities ranging from a country singer to a Playmate of the Year competing in a series of challenges that include creating a children&#39;s book and selling pizzas. At the end of each show, one of them gets fired by Trump.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how do the ratings look? It depends whether you&#39;re referring to recent weeks or to the entire season.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you look at the <a href=\"http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/04/05/tv-ratings-broadcast-top-25-american-idol-ncaa-b-ball-greys-anatomy-dancing-with-the-stars-ncis-top-week-28-viewing/88270\">most recent week&rsquo;s Nielsen ratings</a>, Trump is right. For the week ending April 3, 2011, <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>ranked higher than any NBC prime time broadcast show among adults age 18-49 -- the coveted demographic for television executives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note that the bar is pretty low to be the highest-rated NBC show these days. When you consider shows on all broadcast networks that week, <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>ranked 15th. And <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>was the only NBC show to rank in the top 22 -- behind 10 from CBS, eight from ABC and three from Fox.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll also note that for the previous week -- the one ending March 27 -- <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>finished third on NBC and 19th overall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Trump&#39;s right for the most recent ratings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the entire season, however, <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>is not the top-rated NBC show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMarc Berman, a senior television editor at <em>AdWeek</em>, provided us with the average Nielsen ratings for all 160 broadcast network shows between Sept. 20, 2010, and April 3, 2011 -- basically, the entire season to date.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how the top NBC shows stack up for the 18-to-49 demographic:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t1. <em>Sunday Night Football </em>(3rd overall)<br />\r\n\t2. <em>Football Night in America </em>pregame show (tied for 17th overall)<br />\r\n\t3. <em>The Office </em>(tied for 17th overall)<br />\r\n\t4. <em>The Biggest Loser </em>(tied for 34th overall)<br />\r\n\t5. <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>(tied for 36th overall)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd here are the numbers for all ages:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t1. <em>Sunday Night Football </em>(4th overall)<br />\r\n\t2. <em>Harry&rsquo;s Law </em>(29th overall)<br />\r\n\t3. <em>Football Night in America </em>pregame show (33rd overall)<br />\r\n\t4. <em>Law &amp; Order L.A. </em>(42nd overall)<br />\r\n\t5. <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>(44th overall)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo in both categories, <em>The Celebrity Apprentice </em>ranks fifth behind a mix of scripted dramas, sitcoms, reality shows and Sunday football. By this standard, Trump is wrong to say he has &quot;the No. 1 on NBC.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s misleading,&quot; Berman said. &quot;His show is doing well for NBC, but it&rsquo;s not the No. 1.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Trump&#39;s boast needs some context. He&#39;s right for the most recent ratings, but not for the season overall.
