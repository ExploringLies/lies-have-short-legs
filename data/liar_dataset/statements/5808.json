Scott Walker in April, added penalties if physicians perform medication-induced abortions without an in-person exam before the procedure -- a move aimed at blocking the potential use of so-called &quot;webcam abortions&quot; in Wisconsin. Medication-induced abortions are limited to the first nine weeks of pregnancy. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law also required that doctors tell patients they &quot;must return&quot; for a post-abortion follow-up appointment at the same facility within 12 to 18 days instead of, for example, seeing their primary care doctor where they live. Critics, such as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, say this places an undue burden on women, especially in rural areas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, in the wake of the law, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/1006/120420_Huyck.pdf\">said</a> April 20, 2012 it would stop providing medication-induced abortions, citing legal uncertainty for doctors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill&rsquo;s passage also drew a strong reaction from the Wisconsin Medical Society, which said the law intruded on the patient-doctor relationship.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an April 19 interview with the Wisconsin State Journal, the society&rsquo;s new physician-president, <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/publications_and_media/press_releases#pr_186\">Tosha Wetterneck</a> of Madison, spoke about the mandate that women return to the same facility for follow-up care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story paraphrased Wetterneck&rsquo;s remark this way: &quot;If she refuses, or prefers to see her personal physician, the patient would face no penalty but the doctor could be charged, Wetterneck said.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe remark prompting a <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/04/20/wisconsin-planned-parenthood-to-immediately-stop-offering-medication-abortions-du\">reproductive rights </a>group, RH Reality Check, to say that doctors could face a Class I felony and up to 42 months in jail if the patient does not return for the recommended visit. Its Web posting cited Wetterneck&rsquo;s comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, state Sen. Mary Lazich, R-New Berlin, author of the original bill, <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/1006/4.20_Planned_Parenthood.pdf\">denounced critics&rsquo; descriptions of it</a> as &quot;grossly misstated,&quot; and the claim about criminal charges when patients no-show as &quot;patently false.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, who&rsquo;s right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCan doctors be charged if a patient fails to do something?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile debate rages on about the broad impact of the law -- critics say it limits access to the procedure, proponents say it protects women from substandard care -- we found wide agreement on this narrow question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe consensus: Doctors could face a fine of up to $10,000 if they don&rsquo;t advise women to return in 12 to 18 days -- but not criminal liability.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the forfeiture only applies if the doctor fails to inform -- it&rsquo;s not dependent on what a patient does later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe heard that from Lazich and <a href=\"http://www.wrtl.org/blog/\">Wisconsin Right to Life</a>, but also the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, a state government agency<a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lc/publications/act/2011/act217-sb306.pdf\"> that analyzed the bill</a> -- and even the Medical Society itself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey all said that even though the bill says patients have to be told they &quot;must return,&quot; there is no accountability built into the law for either the woman or the physician if the woman does not come back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo why was Wetterneck of the Medical Society quoted as saying doctors could be charged?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedical Society lobbyist Mark Grapentine told us Wetterneck is not a lawyer and likely thought &quot;charged&quot; was an appropriate description even for forfeitures. He said she and the Medical Society understood the lack of criminal penalties for the no-return scenario, while strongly objecting to felony liability for other aspects of drug abortion protocols.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think the term &quot;charged&quot; would be heard by most listeners as a reference to criminal liability -- as evidenced by the reaction from RH Reality Check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerhaps confusion on the issue was inevitable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law does create a criminal felony penalty for failing to follow certain procedures related to a medication-induced abortion. Just not the protocol on the post-abortion follow-up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpecifically, Act 217 requires that the same doctor who prescribes the drugs do the pre-procedure exam and be physically present when the drug is given. Bill authors say those rules were aimed to block use of Web cameras to consult with women about the drugs, as is done in some states to make abortions more possible in rural areas. <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wi.gov/statutes/statutes/253/10\">By law</a>, at least 24 hours must pass between the patient&rsquo;s voluntary consent and an abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe potential <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/IV/50\">criminal penalty</a> on that point, for the person who provides the drugs, is up to 42 months imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president of the Medical Society said a new abortion law means doctors could be charged if patients don&rsquo;t return for a follow-up appointment after a drug-induced abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn that specific portion of the law, no criminal liability was inserted, and doctors&rsquo; duty is limited to orally informing the patient she must return.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is a new criminal penalty for failing to personally supervise such abortions, but Wetterneck clearly was referring to the follow-up care section of the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate her statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-medical-society-claim-on-doctors-charges-new-abortion-law-al56at1-149226735.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s web site</a>)</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-26T18:14:23.471752", "ruling_date": "2012-04-27T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Medical Society president says doctors could be charged if women don\u2019t return for follow-up care after drug-induced abortions", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-medical-society-president-says-doctors-c", "ruling_link_text": "A possible fine, but not based on what patient doesn\u2019t do", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin State Journal, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/health_med_fit/planned-parenthood-of-wisconsin-plans-to-end-medication-induced-abortions/article_8efc0152-8a72-11e1-af27-0019bb2963f4.html#ixzz1t3sHymYT\">&quot;Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin plans to end medication-induced abortions</a>,&quot; April 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and email interviews with Laura Rose, deputy director, Wisconsin State Legislature Legislative Council, April 23-25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislative Council, Act Memo, Wisconsin 2011 Act 217, April 25 ,2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview with state Sen.
