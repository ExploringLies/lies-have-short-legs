We probably have the best strategic position on the East Coast. We have so many natural assets,&quot; Oliver told the audience. &quot;And, I&rsquo;m gonna get into the subject of education in a moment, but I want to tell you New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country. And we need to stop this self-fulfilling efficacy that we&rsquo;ve got a problem when it comes to adequately educating people in our state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOliver&rsquo;s claim about us having the &quot;most educated population of all the states&quot; is not far off, PolitiFact New Jersey found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn recent years, New Jersey has stood in fifth place among the states for the percentage of its residents, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain the source of Oliver&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back up the claim, Oliver spokesman Tom Hester Jr. cited various education statistics, including a 2009 news article by U.S. News &amp; World Report about, in part, New Jersey having the highest high school graduation rate in 2006.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe also cited a Huffington Post article that claimed the state ranked sixth for the percentage of adults between 25 and 34 years old with college degrees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;New Jersey has the nation&rsquo;s highest high school graduation rate and ranks at the very top in student achievement and college graduation rates,&quot; Hester said in an email. &quot;Quite simply, the Speaker believes that when you combine it all together, NJ has the most educated population.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut two experts told us the best measure to determine the &quot;most educated&quot; states is the educational attainment data compiled by the census bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThrough a spokesman, Thomas Snyder, director of Annual Reports for the National Center for Education Statistics at the U.S. Department of Education, said in an e-mail: &quot;I believe the educational attainment data are the most relevant for this question.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Bills, an associate professor at the University of Iowa&rsquo;s College of Education, agreed that the educational attainment data is the &quot;best available measure.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;d call it the best available measure, with the main problem being that many people complete their education after age 25, so this measure will underestimate how many people will eventually get degrees,&quot; Bills said in an e-mail. &quot;Not everyone over age 25 has completed their schooling.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s explain how many New Jersey residents have college degrees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, 34.5 percent of New Jerseyans, 25 years old and over, had at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, according to the census bureau. In 2010, 35.4 percent of state residents fit the same criteria, according to the census bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn both years, New Jersey was in fifth place behind Massachusetts, Colorado, Maryland and Connecticut. Even after accounting for the margins of error attached to those statistics, New Jersey doesn&rsquo;t place first.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, New Jersey may not have the &quot;most educated&quot; population, but it certainly has one of them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a speech at Rider University, Oliver claimed &quot;New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau, her claim is pretty much on target. In 2009 and 2010, New Jersey ranked fifth for the percentage of its population, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/politifact_nj_sheila_oliver_cl_1.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-22T16:02:00.757663", "ruling_date": "2012-03-23T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Sheila Oliver claims New Jerseyans are the \u201cmost educated\u201d in the nation", "ruling_headline_slug": "sheila-oliver-claims-new-jerseyans-are-most-educat", "ruling_link_text": "NJ ranks 5th for bachelor\u2019s degrees", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.rider.edu/offices/services/rebovich-institute-new-jersey-politics\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.9653016423379158\">Remarks by Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver at Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics</a>, Feb. 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/news_conferences/20110920_webinar_presskit.html\">Webinar: 2010 American Community Survey Single Year Estimates</a>, Sept. 20, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/p20-566.pdf\">Educational Attainment in the United States: 2009</a>, February 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/nj_has_smartest_lawmakers_in_t.html\">N.J. has most educated lawmakers in the nation, study finds</a>, June 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chronicle of Higher Education, <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Degrees-of-Leadership-/127797/\">How educated are state legislators?</a>, June 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0233.pdf\">Educational Attainment by State: 1990 to 2009</a>, accessed March 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, March 20-21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and email interview with David Thomas, spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/\">U.S. Department of Education</a>, March 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with David Bills, <a href=\"http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Esfe/dbills/sfe_dbills.html\">an associate professor at The University of Iowa College of Education</a>, March 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Lutz Hendricks, <a href=\"http://www.lhendricks.org/\">an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, March 20-21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/acs/www/\">2009 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates</a>, accessed March 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/acs/www/\">2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates</a>, accessed March 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/acs/www/\">2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates</a>, accessed March 21, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. News &amp;
