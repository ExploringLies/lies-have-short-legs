(An <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Excise-Tax\">excise tax</a> is somewhat like a sales tax, in that it is paid on a purchase, but it&rsquo;s often included in the purchase price.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother FAA <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/airports/pfc/\">document</a> confirms the passenger facility charge, which is collected by public agencies that run commercial airports and is used for FAA-approved projects at the airports. And a Transportation Security Administration <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/stakeholders/september-11-security-fee-passenger-fee\">document</a> confirms the Sept. 11 fee, which helps fund the TSA.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ran Kelly&rsquo;s statement and his itinerary by Joakim Karlsson, a researcher with the <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/TicketTax/\">Airline Ticket Tax Project</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the project studies ticket taxes and user fees added directly to airline tickets. He called Kelly&rsquo;s statement &quot;mathematically correct, but fundamentally misleading.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKarlsson noted that fares are usually quoted with taxes and fees included. So, a $300 ticket would include a base fare of about $239.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKarlsson calculated that would trigger $61 in taxes and fees, which would still amount to 20 percent of the ticket cost, the same amount Kelly claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut more importantly, Karlsson said, the sample ticket that Kelly uses is not typical:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\tThe typical domestic flight in the U.S. costs $418 (as of 2011), not $300.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\tTwo-thirds of all domestic tickets sold do not include connecting flights, but rather are non-stop, so they incur fewer federal fees.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, a $418 non-stop ticket would include $54 in taxes and fees, or just under 15 percent of the total. (The taxes and fees in Kelly&rsquo;s $300 ticket example, if the trip were non-stop, also would equal just under 15 percent.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means the first part of Kelly&rsquo;s claim is accurate, but leaves out important details.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Taxes and fees on other products</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for the second part of Kelly&rsquo;s statement, the Southwest Airlines spokesman cited a 2011 <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304066504576343732346643992.html\">opinion column</a> in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> by the chief executive officer of Airlines for America, the airlines trade group. The column argued that the taxes paid by airlines are at the &quot;same excessive levels&quot; as &quot;sin&quot; taxes imposed on alcohol, tobacco and gambling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the column provided no figures to show how the various tax rates compare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found the following <a href=\"http://www.ttb.gov/tax_audit/atftaxes.shtml\">figures</a> from the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, a division of the Department of Treasury.
