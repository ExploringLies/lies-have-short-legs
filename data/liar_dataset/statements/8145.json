It&rsquo;s dated Aug. 5, 2013, and labeled &quot;restricted.&quot; The headline reads, &quot;Disarmament Commission -- Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group.&quot; And it&rsquo;s filled with believable bureaucratic jargon, such as creation of a &quot;codification framework&quot; and the need to undergo a &quot;full review by the Office of the Secretary General.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the full text:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;The issue of military grade weaponry in the hands of civilians looms ever larger in the face of the global implementation of 22/Agenda 21 by member nations. In particular, the United States of America has an estimated 500 million weapons in the hands of its civilian population. This is not just a static problem, it is a massive dynamic problem for the process of confiscation as there will be those who refuse to surrender their firearms.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;The conclusion of discussions by the CWCSG led to the adoption of a proposed agenda to begin the process for introducing to member nations a framework by which they can begin codification of national laws to disarm civilians within their borders through a graduated process.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;Within the discussion framework, we have identified several problem areas that must be addressed, they are:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;1. Classification of military grade weapons to be made illegal for possession.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;2. Creation of programs to provide reasonable compensation for voluntary surrender of said arms.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;3. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of concealable firearms.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;4. Codification of laws to begin the restricting and strict licensing of hunting grade firearms.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;5. Codification of laws to restrict the sale of, and possession of ammunition and components to manufacture ammunition.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;6. Finally, codification of laws to completely makes </em>(sic)<em> any and all firearms illegal to own, possess or use outside of military and law enforcement usage.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;7. Creation of a United Nations Police Taskforce with the specific mission of assisting member nations with the collection of weaponry from civilian hands.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;The CWCSG will submit its findings and final recommendations once we have created the codification framework for member nations for a full review by the Office of the Secretary General.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The document is persuasive enough to have been picked up by pro-gun advocates on <a href=\"http://www.northeastshooters.com/vbulletin/general-discussion/218007-civilian-weapons-confiscation-study-group-ny-29-31-july.html\"><u>a few</u></a> <a href=\"http://lunaticoutpost.com/Topic-UN-Disarmament-%E2%80%93-Civilian-Weapons-Confiscation-Study-Group-New-York-July-29-31\"><u>message boards</u></a> and Facebook pages. But is it real?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked with the United Nations, a spokesman declared it a fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I checked the document number on our internal document system, and the reply I got back now was simply, &lsquo;There is no document matching your request,&rsquo; said Farhan Haq, associate spokesperson for the Secretary-General. &quot;The document number (A/CN.11/L.72) doesn&#39;t conform to our standard system, in any case.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Haq said, &quot;there is no such body as a &lsquo;Civilian Weapons Confiscation Study Group.&rsquo; Nor does the United Nations involve itself in confiscating weapons from member states.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Haq said, &quot;the use of blue ink, some of the type font and the scanner icon in the bottom right-hand corner are not found in real U.N. documents. So, in several different ways, this document is fake.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A document found on the Internet and circulating via email and social media says that a United Nations working group has &quot;adopted a proposed agenda&quot; to enable member nations to &quot;disarm civilians within their borders.&quot; If the document were real, it would confirm the worst fears of those who fear a mass confiscation of handguns, hunting rifles and ammunition in the U.S. -- but a United Nations spokesman cited several reasons for concluding that the document is a fake, including the fact that the study group referenced in the document does not exist. We rate the document Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-12T11:47:53.487164", "ruling_date": "2013-08-12T12:15:10", "ruling_headline": "United Nations document shared on social media says civilian gun confiscation is in the works for United States", "ruling_headline_slug": "united-nations-document-shared-social-media-says-c", "ruling_link_text": "U.N. says document is a persuasive-looking fake", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Chain email, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/750427-unoda.html\"><u>purported U.N. document attachment</u></a>, accessed Aug. 12, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Farhan Haq, associate spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General, Aug. 12, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>A United Nations working group has &quot;adopted a proposed agenda&quot; to enable member nations to &quot;disarm civilians within their borders.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a document shared via email and social media", "statement_date": "2013-08-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
