The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governor&rsquo;s office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply can&rsquo;t ignore,&quot; Fitzgerald <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=4254\">told</a> hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our government is growing too fast, too big; it&rsquo;s becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the state&rsquo;s residents -- receive a &quot;government handout?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a lot of Wisconsinites.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Fitzgerald&rsquo;s spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss&rsquo; claim &quot;looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not much of a defense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWelhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-26-government-payments-economy-medicare.htm#\">analysis</a> of federal data done by USA Today:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A record 18.3 percent of the nation&#39;s total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income &mdash; 51 percent &mdash; since the government began keeping track in 1929.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat all may be true. But it&rsquo;s off point. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article indicates what percentage of Americans&rsquo; overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWelhouse didn&rsquo;t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-08-30-1Asafetynet30_ST_N.htm?utm_source=Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=Heritage%2BHotsheet&amp;loc=interstitialskip\">article</a>, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMedicaid: 1,174,874 people, including more than 465,000 children, receive <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/\">Medicaid</a>, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Medicaid, including the state&rsquo;s BadgerCare programs, pays for health care for low-income people.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tFood stamps: 802,979 people, including 353,310 children, were in the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/foodshare/\">FoodShare</a> program as of March 2011, according to the same department.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tUnemployment insurance: 140,055 people are on <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/ui/\">unemployment</a>, according to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWisconsin Works (W-2), which replaced traditional welfare: 43,093 people, including 27,614 children, were receiving <a href=\"http://dcf.wi.gov/w2/\">W-2</a> cash assistance as of April 2011, according to the Wisconsin Department of Children &amp; Families.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55000.html\">according</a> to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number &ndash; nor could Fitzgerald.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a &quot;government handout.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article cited by Fitzgerald&rsquo;s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the bottom line:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents &quot;is on some kind of government handout.&quot; He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Fitzgerald&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-25T21:26:18.807384", "ruling_date": "2011-05-26T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says half of state residents are \u201con some kind of government handout\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-", "ruling_link_text": "Aide says he misspoke.
