John Cornyn, R-Texas, heartily welcomed Republican Scott Brown&rsquo;s upset win Tuesday of a Senate seat in Massachusetts &mdash; a victory that&rsquo;ll soon give the GOP the 41<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Senate seats needed to filibuster legislation to foil<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the Democratic majority.<br /> <br /> Cornyn, who doubles as chairman of a political committee devoted to electing GOP senators, was asked by the Fox News Channel on Wednesday what Republicans should do with the message sent by Massachusetts voters.<br /> <br /> Cornyn initially mentioned public concern about Democrats&rsquo; closed-door rewrites of a health care overhaul. But, Cornyn continued, this \"is a matter also of misplaced priorities and the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work.\"<br /> <br /> We wondered if Cornyn correctly pegged Americans' priority issue.<br /> <br /> Indeed, a recent national poll places the economy at the top of voter concerns. In the poll taken Jan. 12-15 for The Washington Post and ABC News, 42 percent of respondents identified the economy as the most important problem they&rsquo;d like to see President Obama and Congress address this year.&nbsp; Among those economy-focused respondents, 26 percent singled out jobs/employment as a priority.<br /> <br /> The second-highest-rated issue was health care, named as the first concern of 24 percent.<br /> <br /> Similarly, a poll taken Jan. 10-14 by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found jobs topping Americans&rsquo; concerns. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said job creation and economic growth was the top priority<strong>. </strong>Thirteen percent chose national security/terrorism and 13 percent said the deficit and government spending.<br /> <br /> So  the senator got it right. Americans consider jobs the No. 1 issue right now. We rate Cornyn&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-20T17:07:18.081528", "ruling_date": "2010-01-20T17:27:59", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
