They are seeking to replace Democrat Jim Webb, who is not seeking a second Senate term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if the Allen administration really did put a lid on tuition. Allen, while making this claim, shared credit with the Democratic-controlled legislature that served with him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDan Allen, a senior adviser to the campaign, pointed us to a <a href=\"http://www.schev.edu/Reportstats/2011TuitionFeesReport.pdf?from=\">July 2011 report</a> from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study said that during the early 1990s, colleges and universities increased tuitions by double digits annually to compensate for state funding cuts made by the General Assembly and then-Gov. Doug Wilder to help balance the budget during a recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWilder, in his final budget proposal made during an improving economy in December 1993, urged the General Assembly to cap tuition and instructional fee increases for in-state students at 5 percent during the 1994-95 school year and 4 percent during 1995-96.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen, who took office in January 1994, successfully urged the General Assembly go a step further and cap the increases at 3 percent during each of the next two school years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1996, as SCHEV notes, &nbsp;Allen and the General Assembly froze tuition and instructional fees entirely. &nbsp;The action did not apply to a number of other mandatory college costs, such as fees for athletic programs, health services and campus transportation. Lawmakers eased some of the burden on colleges by appropriating an additional $200 million for higher education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Richmond Times-Dispatch in January 1998 reported that a strong economy during Allen&rsquo;s term allowed him to finance the tuition freeze. State tax revenues grew by about 45 percent during his tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen, in his farewell budget, recommended freezing tuition through 2000. His successor, Republican Jim Gilmore, rolled back tuition and instructional fees by 20 percent for in-state students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Allen arrived in the governor&rsquo;s mansion during the 1993-94 academic year, the average tuition and instructional fees for full time, in-state undergraduate students at four-year colleges was $2,518, <a href=\"http://www.schev.edu/Reportstats/tuition-fees62001.pdf?from=\">according to SCHEV&rsquo;s historical tables</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat rose to $2,717 in the 1995-1996 academic year and stayed at that level through 1997-1998, the last academic year of Allen&rsquo;s term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing inflation-adjusted figures based on 1992 dollars, the report shows the amount of tuition and instructional fees went &nbsp;from $2,383 in the 1993-94 &nbsp;academic year down to $2,320 in 1997-98. Even when other mandatory fees that were not subject freeze are added in, the college costs remained flat after being adjusted for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCosts at two-year colleges showed the same trend: in-state tuition and instructional fees at those institutions were basically flat during Allen&rsquo;s term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen said that, as governor, he stopped soaring tuition costs by implementing a tuition freeze.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen and the General Assembly did impose a freeze after tuition had risen sharply during the early 1990s recession. Allen had leeway to cap tuitions because a healthy economy during his term allowed lawmakers to increase state appropriations to colleges and universities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Allen&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-15T18:19:53.082532", "ruling_date": "2012-06-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "George Allen says he froze college tuition when he was governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "george-allen-says-he-froze-college-tuition-when-he", "ruling_link_text": "Thanks to a good economy", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTSh6eBZmas\">&quot;Falls Church 2012 U.S. Senate Debate&quot;</a> May 25, 2012.
