While we waited for a response, we looked on our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm\"><u>historical minimum wage data</u></a>, we went to the U.S. Department of Labor. During the time period Reed was talking about, the minimum rose six times, starting at 40 cents per hour and eventually reaching $1.60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much did it take to lift someone out of poverty during that era? That&#39;s a much harder question to answer, and it depends on the size of the family, something Reed wasn&#39;t specific about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal poverty level, the adequacy of which is still <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/28/occupy-democrats/pro-democrat-group-says-9-10-poorest-states-are-re/\"><u>the subject of debate</u></a>, wasn&#39;t developed until the early 1960s, so it wasn&#39;t even in existence during the start of the time period Reed was talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ocpp.org/poverty/how/\"><u>first &quot;poverty threshold</u></a>,&quot; in 1963, was about $3,100 for a family of four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone earning the minimum wage that year would have earned $2,460, enough for a family of three but not a family of four, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2013/3e.html#table3.e8\"><u>&quot;Social Welfare and the Economy&quot; page</u></a> on the Social Security Administration&#39;s Office of Retirement and Disability Policy website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those data only go back to 1959. We used a <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\"><u>cost of living calculator</u></a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to get a rough idea of living costs from 1950 through 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to our calculations, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the minimum wage was high enough to keep an individual above the poverty level</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first time it was enough to push a two-person family above the poverty level was in 1956, when it jumped to $1 an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But throughout the 1950s and 1960s, in most years, the minimum wage couldn&rsquo;t lift a family of three out of poverty and was never enough for a family of four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we shared our information with Reed&#39;s office, they provided information that confirmed our findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reed spokesman Chip Unruh said the senator&rsquo;s statement about the minimum wage and poverty levels in the &lsquo;50s and &lsquo;60s is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it is very clear that Reed is talking about his perception that hard work used to get you a livable wage,&quot; he said. &quot;The federal poverty rate as measured today didn&#39;t always exist as a unit of measurement, but that doesn&#39;t mean poverty itself didn&#39;t exist . . . Reed referenced families earlier in his speech, but he also was referencing individuals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Jack Reed, lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage, said that in the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;the minimum wage was such that it would lift you out of poverty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that during that period, the minimum wage always generated enough income to keep an individual out of poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when it comes to making enough money to support a family -- and Reed made several references to families -- that wasn&#39;t always true during those two decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on federal data, the minimum wage didn&#39;t become high enough to support a two-person family until about 1956 and it wasn&#39;t consistently high enough to lift a family of three until 1967. It never covered a family of four, regarded as a typical family size in that era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One might assume that Reed was talking about families, but the statement we&#39;re checking isn&#39;t specific.
