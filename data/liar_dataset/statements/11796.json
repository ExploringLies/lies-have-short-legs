Ted Cruz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before bringing on Trump, host Chuck Todd showed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4gXlEteTk\">a new Cruz ad</a> criticizing the real estate tycoon&rsquo;s support for eminent domain, the government&rsquo;s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects. The ad quotes Trump as saying, &quot;I think eminent domain is wonderful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It made him rich &mdash; like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at his casino,&quot; the ad says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yt4gXlEteTk\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump launched into his critique right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Trump in <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-you-need-eminent-domain-or-you-don-t-have-a-country-607834691787\">the clip</a>, &quot;and I have to tell you his ad is wrong because I never knocked down that house. I wanted to get that house to build a major building that would have employed a tremendous numbers of people, but when the woman didn&rsquo;t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it. So he&rsquo;s got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down, it&rsquo;s false advertising.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Todd said, &quot;Well, all right, the accusation was that that&rsquo;s what you wanted to do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump stood by his takedown: &quot;No, the accusation was that I did it, and I didn&rsquo;t do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that both Cruz and Trump are stretching the truth about what happened with a widow&rsquo;s home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this fact-check, we&rsquo;ll focus on Trump saying&nbsp;Cruz has&nbsp;&quot;got me bull-dozing down a house.&nbsp;I never bulldozed it down. It&#39;s false advertising.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Donald vs. Vera</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/07/club-growth/trump-supports-eminent-domain-abuse-says-conservat/\">In a prior fact-check</a>, we found Trump is sort of a poster boy for eminent domain (and he really did call the practice &quot;wonderful&quot; as recently as October.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a government-run project. However, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in the 2005 case <em>Kelo vs. New London, Conn.,</em> said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The court decided the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz&rsquo;s ad references <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-time-donald-trumps-empire-took-on-a-stubborn-widow--and-lost/2015/09/09/f9cb287e-5660-11e5-b8c9-944725fcd3b9_story.html\">a period in the 1990s</a>, prior to <em>Kelo</em>, when Trump wanted the state of New Jersey to use its eminent domain power to help him with a casino project. Trump planned to build a limousine garage to service the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City but several pieces of private property were in the way, including a home owned since the 1960s by a widow in her late 60s named Vera Coking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/nyregion/a-homeowner-who-refused-to-cash-out-in-a-gambling-town-may-have-missed-her-chance.html?_r=0\">has said </a>he offered Coking millions for her property, but she wouldn&rsquo;t give up her home. In <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/nyregion/our-towns-one-person-s-public-good-is-another-s-squeeze-play.html\">1994</a>, New Jersey&rsquo;s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened to use eminent domain to seize the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/21/nyregion/metro-news-briefs-new-jersey-trump-and-state-defend-attempt-to-seize-property.html\">dispute</a> ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/21/nyregion/widowed-homeowner-foils-trump-in-atlantic-city.html\">ruled against </a>Trump and the government in 1998. After losing the case, Trump gave up his plan to buy Coking&rsquo;s house, telling the <em><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kicks-sand-trump-face-sneers-donald-bucks-article-1.815484\">New York Daily News </a></em>that he was &quot;no longer an interested buyer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bottom line is it&#39;s too bad for Atlantic City, but it&#39;s not too bad for me because I&#39;m not interested in the property,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Nobody gets under my skin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coking&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://ij.org/case/casino-reinvestment-development-authority-v-coking/\">supporters</a> painted Trump as a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/09/nyregion/doonesbury-comes-calling.html\">villainous fat cat</a>. Coking herself called him &quot;a maggot, a cockroach and a crumb.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/16/trump-plaza-closes-making-it-official-a-third-of-atlantic-citys-casinos-have-closed-this-year/\">Trump Plaza closed in September 2014</a> after struggling financially. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/nyregion/a-homeowner-who-refused-to-cash-out-in-a-gambling-town-may-have-missed-her-chance.html?_r=0\">Trump told</a> the <em>New York Times</em> that ownership of Coking&rsquo;s property would not have saved it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to Cruz&rsquo;s ad, Trump has a point that it is misleading to imply he got &quot;rich&quot; after bulldozing an elderly widow&rsquo;s home, given that Coking kept her property, and Trump never got anything out of it. But Trump exaggerated &nbsp;when he said &quot;when the woman didn&rsquo;t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it.&quot; It took several years of failed negotiations and losing a lawsuit for him to decide he was no longer interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump says Cruz&#39;s ad has &quot;got me bull-dozing down a house.&nbsp;I never bulldozed it down. It&#39;s false advertising.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you read the ad as Trump does, he is right: The woman&rsquo;s home was never destroyed as a result of eminent domain. He never got rich off of this deal because the case for eminent domain didn&rsquo;t pan out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that reading ignores another interpretation of Cruz&rsquo;s point: Trump certainly tried to take over the property before the state Superior Court stepped in and ruled in the woman&rsquo;s favor. Trump didn&rsquo;t mention the years-long legal battle on <em>Meet the Press</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For glossing over some important context, we rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-24T11:25:37.912279", "ruling_date": "2016-01-24T16:24:46", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump calls out Ted Cruz ad about Trump bulldozing a widow's home as 'false advertising'", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-calls-out-ted-cruz-ad-about-trump-bul", "ruling_link_text": "He tried and failed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/07/club-growth/trump-supports-eminent-domain-abuse-says-conservat/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump supports eminent domain &#39;abuse,&#39; says conservative Club for Growth</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/09/24/443131389/get-off-my-lawn-conservatives-critique-trump-on-eminent-domain\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Get Off My Lawn: Conservatives Critique Trump On Eminent Domain,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/us/politics/ted-cruz-condemns-donald-trump-for-his-use-of-eminent-domain.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ted Cruz Condemns Donald Trump for His Use of Eminent Domain,</u></a>&quot; Jan. 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/nyregion/a-homeowner-who-refused-to-cash-out-in-a-gambling-town-may-have-missed-her-chance.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>A Homeowner&rsquo;s Refusal to Cash Out in a Gambling Town Proves Costly</u></a>,&quot; July 21, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Daily News</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/kicks-sand-trump-face-sneers-donald-bucks-article-1.815484\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>She kicks sand in Trump&rsquo;s face, sneers at the Donald&rsquo;s bucks,</u></a>&quot; July 26, 1998</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Institute for Justice, &quot;<a href=\"http://ij.org/case/casino-reinvestment-development-authority-v-coking/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Atlantic City Condemnation &ndash; Vera Coking,</u></a>&quot; accessed Jan. 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/16/trump-plaza-closes-making-it-official-a-third-of-atlantic-citys-casinos-have-closed-this-year/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump Plaza closes, making it official: A third of Atlantic City&rsquo;s casinos have closed this year,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-time-donald-trumps-empire-took-on-a-stubborn-widow--and-lost/2015/09/09/f9cb287e-5660-11e5-b8c9-944725fcd3b9_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The time Donald Trump&rsquo;s empire took on a stubborn widow &mdash; and lost</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NJ.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/trumps_eminent_domain_comments_recall_1990s_atlantic_city_property_battle.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump eminent domain comment rekindles his 1990s Atlantic City property battle,</u></a>&quot; Oct. 11, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says a Ted Cruz ad has &quot;got me bull-dozing down a house.&nbsp;I never bulldozed it down.
