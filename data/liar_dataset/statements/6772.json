The <a href=\"http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/306.815\">tax is already prohibited in Oregon</a>, with the exception of Washington County, but advocates want to make sure the state doesn&rsquo;t implement a tax or allow local governments to impose one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reasons put forth by the Oregon Association of Realtors basically boil down to this: Home prices are down, property taxes are high enough, and you don&rsquo;t want another tax that would make it harder to buy or sell a home. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group also plants a <a href=\"http://oregonvotes.gov/pages/history/archive/nov62012/military_vp/votersguide.html#Arguments%20in%20Favor\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6606888518868363\">bug of fear </a>in tax haters with this: &quot;Politicians have considered the idea of charging or allowing multiple layers of transfer taxes each and every legislative session for the last decade, and in fact one of the state&rsquo;s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year.&quot; (our emphasis)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObviously, we wanted to know which large government made charging this tax a priority. Who was it and what happened? (Was it the tax-happy city of Portland?) We contacted the Realtors&rsquo; association and received a response from Jon Coney, spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.yesonmeasure79.com/issue.html\">Yes on 79 campaign, previously known as Protect Oregon Homes.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt turns out the campaign was indeed talking about the city of Portland. As evidence that this large government body had &quot;made charging this tax&quot; a top priority this year, Coney shared a draft of the <a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/govtrelations/index.cfm?a=382724&amp;c=35411\">2012 Legislative Agenda for the city of Portland</a>. An agenda!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe got a copy of the final agenda. One of seven items on it was to &quot;strongly oppose any legislation that would preempt the City&rsquo;s authority and support legislation that proposes to lift preemptions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPreemption, for those who don&rsquo;t know, is when a superior government body regulates in a given area and pretty much trumps a lesser government&rsquo;s ability to do the same. The state trumps cities, and the feds trump states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCities and counties generally dislike preemption, because it usually ties their ability to raise revenue, also known as taxes and fees. Two particularly vexing subject areas -- taxing cigarettes and alcohol, and levying real estate transfer fees -- are indeed specified as examples in the city&rsquo;s 2012 legislative agenda. That&rsquo;s all accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we asked Coney how supporting flexibility to be able to maybe one day pass a real estate transfer tax -- along with higher alcohol and cigarette taxes, if you follow the group&rsquo;s reasoning -- is the same as making the imposition of such a tax a top priority this year? He said he didn&rsquo;t want to get into a fight over semantics, but one leads to the other.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s pretty clear for us, in 2012, putting this on their legislative agenda clearly is a strong signal that they want to pursue this taxing mechanism,&quot; Coney said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAre the two acts one and the same? He said, &quot;It is our position that asking that the (prohibition) be lifted is essentially leading to the institution of the real estate tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo this is the evidence the campaign provides for making the claim that the city of Portland made charging this tax a top priority this year: A legislative agenda in which the tax is given as an example among several examples on one issue out of seven. And by the way, <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.or.us/12reg/pubs/index.pdf\">legislation wasn&rsquo;t even drafted</a>. And the Realtors know this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMaybe we missed talk of a real estate transfer tax somewhere? At a city council meeting at some point? Nope, the campaign can provide no other evidence. They can, however, point to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/protect-oregon-homes/\">previous legislative attempts, which got nowhere</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&rsquo;t remember it being raised,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/fish/\">Nick Fish</a>, the city commissioner in charge of housing. &quot;It&rsquo;s been on a laundry list of preemptions we object to on principle. Other than this campaign brought by Realtors, I don&rsquo;t even remember a conversation about the real property tax in the last year or two.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Martha Pellegrino, lead lobbyist for the city of Portland, if the city would go ahead with a transfer tax if the prohibition were lifted. The answer is no, she said: &quot;Just because the state repeals a preemption of local authority does not mean that the City, or any other local government, would automatically act.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re certain some of you don&rsquo;t care what Pellegrino or Fish -- or any other government official says -- they will or won&rsquo;t do. And it&rsquo;s absolutely accurate to say that Portland officials could levy a tax on every transfer of property as soon as the pesky state prohibition is gone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the only evidence the campaign provides is a legislative agenda for a short legislative session in which no legislation was drafted. How does that translate into making &quot;charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year?&quot; It doesn&rsquo;t. And that makes the statement both inaccurate and ridiculous.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-25T21:01:31.655529", "ruling_date": "2012-09-25T17:59:33", "ruling_headline": "Did the City of Portland make charging a real estate transfer tax a top priority this year?
