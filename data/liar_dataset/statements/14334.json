And even they agreed it&rsquo;s convoluted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax code &quot;rewards taxpayers who can afford expensive tax advice and discriminates against taxpayers who cannot,&quot; the <a href=\"https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media/Default/Documents/2016-ARC/ARC16_Volume1_LR_01_TaxReform.pdf\">report</a> said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But are there more Americans employed as tax preparers than police and firefighters? After a reader asked us to look into it, we found it&rsquo;s not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will did not respond to our request for comment, but the number in the story linked to a U.S. News &amp; World Report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/08/15/there-are-more-tax-preparers-in-america-than-firefighters-and-police-combined\">article</a> from 2012, which we eventually traced back to an Internal Revenue Service <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4832.pdf\">report </a>citing a 2007 statistic. The number given was that between 900,000 and 1.2 million people were &quot;preparing tax returns for a fee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the IRS for a more recent estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/return-preparer-office-federal-tax-return-preparer-statistics\">713,448</a> people had current preparer tax identification numbers, or PTINs, in 2017, the closest estimate to the number of people employed as tax preparers this year. This is an annually renewed credential that the IRS requires of every tax preparer, a prerequisite that wasn&rsquo;t in place when the original estimate Will cited was created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Labor Statistics Bureau found in May 2016 that <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes333051.htm\">657,690</a> people are employed as police and sheriff&#39;s patrol officers. In turn, the BLS counted <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes332011.htm\">315,910</a> firefighters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we added the number of these civil officers together, they exceeded tax preparers by 260,152 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BLS had a much lower figure for people employed as tax preparers -- <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132082.htm\">70,030</a> people &nbsp;-- but these don&rsquo;t include individuals who were self-employed or identified as attorneys, accountants or auditors, as the survey only allows people to identify one occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will isn&#39;t the only person to make this mistake. A May 13, 2017, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721937-donald-trumps-economic-strategy-unimaginative-and-incoherent-cooking-up-economic-policy\"><em>Economist</em> article</a> also included the outdated information.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Will said that the number of tax preparers outnumbered the number of firefighters and police officers in the United States, but he was looking at outdated data.
