The post says it has been shared more than 363,000 times on Facebook, which flagged the story as part of its efforts to stamp on fake news in its users&rsquo; news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article can be traced back to a <a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/new-law-now-charging-all-protesters-with-terrorism-lawmakers-urging-americans-to-share-this/\">Nov. 17, 2016, item</a> on ConservativeDailyPost.com, but <a href=\"http://departedmedia.com/new-law-now-charging-violent-protesters-terrorism-spread-news-share/\">it has</a> <a href=\"http://www.newsbysquad.com/new-law-now-charging-protesters-terrorism-spread-news-share/\">been shared</a> <a href=\"http://rogue-nation3.com/archive/index.php?thread-1229.html\">on several</a> <a href=\"http://www.themoralofthestory.us/?p=6115\">other websites</a>. It says a Republican has a new legal solution for dealing with liberal protesters &mdash; a law charging them with &quot;economic terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline on the post makes it sound as if a law allowing terrorism charges for protesters is already in place. The body of the post implies the law is on a national scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not an accurate description of what happened. The headline takes the core of a real event&nbsp;but builds a story full of incorrect details around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s currently no law on the books along these lines. <a href=\"http://dougericksen.src.wastateleg.org/\">Washington state Sen. Doug Ericksen</a> did suggest a bill criminalizing protests in the way described. The Republican <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/306580-washington-republican-floats-charging-protesters-with-economic-terrorism\">proposed the measure in November</a>, after protests erupted following President Donald Trump&rsquo;s election. The idea was aimed largely at environmental activists in the Pacific Northwest who looked to shut down commercial and transportation projects in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ericksen said his bill would make protesting a felony were the protest to &quot;block transportation and commerce, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk.&quot; There are already <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/what-do-if-your-rights-are-violated-demonstration-or-protest\">legal guidelines in place limiting protests</a> &mdash; you can be arrested for harassing people, or blocking walkways, streets or the entrances to buildings, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Ericksen wanted to make the punishments much more severe. The &quot;economic terrorism&quot; charges could be levied against groups that organized such protests. Penalties would have included a $10,000 fine and up to five years in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people&rsquo;s lives and property, it goes too far,&quot; Ericksen said. &quot;Fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression. Those who employ it must be called to account.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ericksen is serving as communications director for the Environmental Protection Agency as part of Trump&rsquo;s transition team while also keeping his state office, <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/residents-look-to-recall-senator-on-trump-transition-team/\">drawing a recall effort</a> from opponents. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But at the time the post was written, Ericksen was only <em>proposing </em>a bill penalizing protesters that harshly, and only in his state. That alarmed critics and the <a href=\"http://q13fox.com/2016/11/16/republican-state-senator-proposes-creating-new-crime-of-economic-terrorism-aimed-at-protesters/\">state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He did <a href=\"http://dougericksen.src.wastateleg.org/ericksen-introduces-preventing-economic-disruption-act/\">eventually file a bill</a> in the state Senate, but it wasn&rsquo;t quite as severe as the one he originally suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2017-18/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5009.pdf#page=1\">SB 5009</a> would impose prison terms on protesters who &quot;cause an economic disruption,&quot; ranging from 60 days for a misdemeanor and up to a year for a felony. One example to which he referred was of Washington protesters who<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/5c044b98d6224ebab0813675f55cdb81/protesters-block-train-tracks-2-washington-refineries\"> blocked train tracks to two oil refineries</a> in May 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill is <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5009&amp;Year=2017\">currently sitting</a> in the state Senate&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Pages/default.aspx\">Law and Justice Committee</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no national law that brands protesters as terrorists. The headline makes a ridiculous leap to misrepresent&nbsp;the actions of a Washington state senator. We rate it Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eaefa54d-17d4-415b-a5a9-53c3ea6a8d78\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eaefa54d-17d4-415b-a5a9-53c3ea6a8d78</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-14T17:13:56.117421", "ruling_date": "2017-02-14T17:33:49", "ruling_headline": "Fake news alert: Bloggers claim protesters can now be labeled terrorists under new law", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-news-alert-bloggers-claim-protesters-can-be-l", "ruling_link_text": "A bill in Washington state, not a national law", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>RedRockTribune.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://redrocktribune.com/chrging-prtsters/\">New law now charging all violent protesters with terrorism, spread the news and share this!!</a>,&quot; November 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ConservativeDailyPost.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/new-law-now-charging-all-protesters-with-terrorism-lawmakers-urging-americans-to-share-this/\">New Law Now Charging All Protesters With Terrorism, Lawmakers URGING Americans To Share This</a>,&quot; Nov. 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/5c044b98d6224ebab0813675f55cdb81/protesters-block-train-tracks-2-washington-refineries\">Protesters block train tracks to 2 Washington refineries</a>,&quot; May 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/306580-washington-republican-floats-charging-protesters-with-economic-terrorism\">Washington Republican proposes charging protestors with &#39;economic terrorism&#39;</a>,&quot; Nov. 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q13 Fox, &quot;<a href=\"http://q13fox.com/2016/11/16/republican-state-senator-proposes-creating-new-crime-of-economic-terrorism-aimed-at-protesters/\">Republican state senator proposes creating new crime of &lsquo;economic terrorism&rsquo; aimed at protesters</a>,&quot; Nov. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen.
