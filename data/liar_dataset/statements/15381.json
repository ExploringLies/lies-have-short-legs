Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., heated up, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey took a shot in a radio <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news-daily-patrick-morrisey-may-11-2018\">interview</a> with Breitbart, saying Manchin too often stands against President Donald Trump, who remains popular in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Referring to Trump&rsquo;s appointee to the Supreme Court, Morrisey said, &quot;If Joe Manchin had his way, Judge (Neil) Gorsuch never would have been able to get a vote&quot; in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey went on to say, &quot;Whether we&#39;re talking judicial picks, whether we&#39;re talking Trump tax cuts, whether we&#39;re talking unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare ... Joe Manchin has not stood with President Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey is right that Manchin <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00303\">voted against</a> the tax bill supported by Trump and most Republicans. But he isn&rsquo;t really right about Manchin&rsquo;s positions on Gorsuch and modifying Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the Obamacare assertion here; we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/patrick-morrisey/patrick-morrisey-cherry-picks-joe-manchins-votes-t/\">separately fact-checked</a> the part about Gorsuch in another item.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: Despite voting against the major Obamacare overhaul that most Republicans supported, Manchin has been open to making incremental changes to the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Changing Obamacare</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin voted against the major Obamacare overhauls that most Republicans supported in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Senate took up three varieties of bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Manchin <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/us/politics/senate-votes-repeal-obamacare.html\">voted against</a> all three bills, siding with all other Democrats. All three failed, due to Republican defections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is wrong to say that Manchin was unwilling to &quot;change&quot; the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2017, Manchin told West Virginia&rsquo;s MetroNews radio that he had told Republican leaders that he&#39;s &quot;happy to sit down with you to see if we can find a pathway forward&quot; on Obamacare, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/joe-manchin-obamacare-fixes-233541\">reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months later, Manchin repeated that sentiment, telling <a href=\"http://wvmetronews.com/2017/06/23/manchin-still-pushing-for-aca-fixes-as-u-s-senate-nears-replacement-vote/\">MetroNews&rsquo; Talkline</a>&nbsp;that he was still willing to work toward fixes for Obamacare, even as he objected to the Republican plan for a thorough overhaul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If they want to say, &lsquo;Okay, Joe, we can&rsquo;t pass this thing. Will you sit down and work with us?&rsquo; I&rsquo;m there tonight with them and I&rsquo;ll get six or seven or eight other very like-minded Democrats,&quot; Manchin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin then <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/342627-manchin-organizing-bipartisan-healthcare-meeting-tuesday-night\">organized</a> a bipartisan health care policy meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps most important, Manchin was one of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexander-and-murray-announce-co-sponsors-of-bipartisan-obamacare-fix/\">24 original supporters</a> &mdash; 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans &mdash; of a bill written by Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., that was touted as a way to fix rather than scuttle Obamacare. The measure would have granted flexibility for states to allow a wider variety of insurance policies while temporarily continuing certain Obamacare payments that were at risk under a repeal. (It remains pending.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin also expressed <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/28/repeal-dead-bi-partisan-senators-seek-path-health-reform/519895001/\">public support</a> for efforts by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to modify Obamacare short of repeal, which crystallized as <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1835?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22s.+1835%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1\">S. 1835</a>, which would allow states to apply for funding for a reinsurance program or high-risk pool program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Morrisey camp pointed to several votes, including a number of Republican attempts to either repeal Obamacare entirely or make sweeping changes to it. But Morrisey&rsquo;s use of the word &quot;change&quot; suggests something more measured than those bills offered, so we won&rsquo;t consider them as evidence of Morrisey&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the other votes Morrisey&rsquo;s campaign cited, three concerned one narrow provision of the law: the &quot;Cadillac&quot; tax on high-cost health care plans. This provision has been controversial ever since the passage of the law, and the effective date has regularly been pushed back by Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin declined to push back the effective date on at least three occasions, sometimes alongside Republicans. On one such vote in <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00316\">December 2015</a>, Manchin was joined by six other Democrats and three Republicans. On <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00339\">another vote</a> that same month, Manchin was joined by 26 Republicans and six other Democrats or Democratic-aligned Independents. The third vote, in <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00177\">July 2017</a>, was largely along party lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey&rsquo;s campaign mentioned other Obamacare-related votes on taxes, including a 2013 amendment to repeal Obamacare tax increases <a href=\"https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/newsreleases/crapo-attempts-to-eliminate-obamacare-tax-increases-on-middle-class\">that hit &quot;middle-income Americans</a>.&quot; These included the tax penalty for not purchasing health insurance, the &quot;Cadillac&quot; tax, expense deductions and penalties for withdrawing funds from health savings accounts. This amendment <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00053\">failed</a> on a party-line vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These comprise the strongest piece of evidence for Morrisey&rsquo;s position, but they mostly involve relatively narrow tax provisions affecting how the law is funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Manchin has also pursued his own efforts to tweak the bill narrowly, such as <a href=\"https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-bipartisan-group-of-senators-introduce-legislation-to-exempt-volunteer-first-responders-from-healthcare-mandate\">exempting volunteer first responders</a> from the tax for not having health insurance; to <a href=\"https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-manchin-and-kirk-introduce-legislation-to-delay-individual-mandate-penalty\">delay the individual mandate penalty</a>; and to redefine <a href=\"https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-seeks-to-redefine-full-time-employee-to-expand-access-to-health-coverage\">who counts as a full-time employee</a> under the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey said&nbsp;Manchin displayed an &quot;unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin did oppose the various Republican-led repeal efforts, but he has worked actively to promote incremental changes to Obamacare &mdash;&nbsp;not only rhetorically&nbsp;but also by backing bipartisan bills intended as efforts to modify Obamacare without scuttling it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-14T17:25:37.268766", "ruling_date": "2018-05-15T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Patrick Morrisey says Joe Manchin won't budge on Obamacare, ignoring bipartisan efforts", "ruling_headline_slug": "patrick-morrisey-says-joe-manchin-wont-budge-obama", "ruling_link_text": "Won't even budge?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Patrick Morrisey, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-773315583/patrick-morrisey-on-joe-manchins-voting-record/s-sDAk8\">interview with Breitbart radio</a>, May 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S.1835, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1835?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22s.+1835%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1\">Lower Premiums Through Reinsurance Act of 2017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WV MetroNews, &quot;<a href=\"http://wvmetronews.com/2017/06/23/manchin-still-pushing-for-aca-fixes-as-u-s-senate-nears-replacement-vote/\">Manchin still pushing for ACA fixes as U.S. Senate nears replacement vote</a>,&quot; June 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/joe-manchin-obamacare-fixes-233541\">Manchin: I&#39;ll help GOP &#39;repair&#39; Obamacare</a>,&quot; Jan. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexander-and-murray-announce-co-sponsors-of-bipartisan-obamacare-fix/\">Alexander and Murray announce 24 co-sponsors of bipartisan Obamacare fix</a>,&quot; October 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/19/558797082/sure-theres-a-health-care-deal-that-doesn-t-mean-it-can-pass\">Sure, There&#39;s A Health Care Deal.
