Scott Walker couldn&rsquo;t resist an extra jab on jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://elections.wispolitics.com/2014/09/rga-tv-ad-accuses-burke-of-using.html\">spot sponsored by the Republican Governors Association</a>, which began running Sept. 23, 2014, the narrator points to Wisconsin job losses during the Great Recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The truth is Burke&rsquo;s record is one of failure and job loss, with plagiarism to cover it up,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;Don&rsquo;t go backwards with Mary Burke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the words are spoken, this message fills the screen:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Burke&rsquo;s record: 130,000 fewer jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a familiar figure to us -- and probably to most voters by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the campaign trail, Walker has repeatedly juxtaposed the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/526/create-250000-new-jobs/\">100,000-plus jobs added during his first term</a> with the total job loss in the last term under his Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke served as commerce secretary under Doyle for about three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an earlier factcheck of a Walker claim that Doyle&rsquo;s policies in his last term &quot;saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs,&quot; we found the number to be accurate -- Doyle&rsquo;s second term saw a drop of 133,943 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the claim was far off on the blame game. As such, we rated the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/18/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-policies-democrat-jim-doyle-/\">Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists agreed that Wisconsin&rsquo;s economy was caught in the same economic crash that crippled the entire country. The recession was deeper and more severe than any single state&rsquo;s policies, including those of Doyle. And, notably, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are even bigger problems with the RGA taking a figure for Doyle&rsquo;s last term and applying it to Burke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her time as head of Commerce spanned parts of both Doyle&rsquo;s terms, and she only served for 10 months of the four-year term the RGA associates with the 130,000 job loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, she wasn&rsquo;t even around when the job losses started coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke started in February 2005 and left in November 2007 -- shortly before the downturn. Nationally, the Great Recession began in December 2007, but Wisconsin didn&rsquo;t see a decline in quarterly jobs figures until mid 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state saw <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-job-growth-better-under-jim-doyl/\">jobs turnaround in 2010, the last year Doyle was in office, and annual growth has continued under Walker</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Burke&rsquo;s time at Commerce</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what happened with jobs while Burke was at the helm of Commerce?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics show Wisconsin added between 43,500 and 59,100 private-sector positions during Burke&rsquo;s time in state government, depending on which federal data source is analyzed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, a governor&rsquo;s policies have limited impact on increases or decreases in jobs, given the many factors that drive a state&rsquo;s economy. And, as we have noted previously, a Commerce secretary&rsquo;s influence would be even smaller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even if all that were set aside, and the RGA is right to attach all of Doyle&rsquo;s second-term numbers to Burke, what about the other side of the coin? After all, she also served during Doyle&rsquo;s first term. Shouldn&rsquo;t those be included as well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state gained 86,530 jobs in Doyle&rsquo;s first term from 2003 through 2006, so when combined with the losses of the second term, the final score for Doyle&rsquo;s eight years was a &nbsp;loss of 47,000 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not good. But also not 130,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican Governors Association said Mary Burke&rsquo;s record is one of &quot;130,000 fewer jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that number corresponds to Doyle&rsquo;s second term, not Burke&rsquo;s time as head of Commerce -- a period that saw an increase. Even with the most charitable of possible interpretations, the number is wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Read our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2014/aug/29/factchecking-jobs-claims-try-home/\">tipsheet on five things to watch for</a> when you hear jobs claims)</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-03T10:17:41.417583", "ruling_date": "2014-10-03T10:42:42", "ruling_headline": "Republican ad blames Mary Burke for loss of 130,000 jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "republican-ad-blames-mary-burke-loss-130000-jobs", "ruling_link_text": "Actually a net gain of jobs on her watch", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>RGA Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYcQ_RnFt_0\">&quot;Plagiarism&quot; ad</a>, published on YouTube, Sept. 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics for quarterly and monthly job creation statistics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walk-O-Meter, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/526/create-250000-new-jobs/\">250,000 new jobs promise</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/18/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-policies-democrat-jim-doyle-/\">Gov.
