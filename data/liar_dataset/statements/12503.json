And among these additional districts, per the state, the North East and Northside districts had the highest 2014 graduation rates (93.4 or 94.1 percent depending on the calculation). More than half the North East district lies within San Antonio, <a href=\"http://www.neisd.net/community.html\">the district says</a>, though it takes in smaller cities including Castle Hills. Northside <a href=\"http://nisd.net/content/northside-isd-destination-district\">describes itself</a> as located in the northwest quadrant of San Antonio. The Socorro district, with 88.2 to 89.8 percent graduation rates, similarly fared better than the Austin district. The Socorro district <a href=\"http://www.sisd.net/Page/24188\">says</a> its serves students in East El Paso, the city of Socorro and Horizon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could also look at districts based on enrollment, an approach that arguably elevates a suburban Houston district, the 110,000-student Cypress-Fairbanks district, into consideration. Its graduation rates of 91.4 and 92.4 percent, respectively, outpaced the 80,000-student Austin district&rsquo;s rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ran these alternate comparisons past Telles, who said it&rsquo;s always a challenge to convert educational &quot;speak&quot; and/or data into something digestible for the general public. &quot;We&rsquo;re dealing with marketers that tell us billboard advertising is kind of complicated when you go more than six words,&quot; Telles said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telles said the district could have compared Austin with its fellow &quot;major urban&quot; districts. Then again, he said, &quot;if you say Northside, the average person, I&rsquo;d venture to say, would not know where that is.&quot; The ad statement, he said, came down to &quot;consumability.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a follow-up email, Telles noted that more than half the Austin district&rsquo;s student population is considered at risk of dropping out &mdash; which is also the case in the four districts it chose for the comparison. But that wasn&#39;t so, Telles wrote, for the Northside, North East or Socorro districts. In 2014, according to TEA data, 56 percent of Austin students were considered &quot;at risk.&quot; Half of Socorro students were at risk, the agency says, as were 43 percent of Northside students and 36 percent of North East students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Austin district says it has the &quot;highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This declaration is rooted in the faulty premise that Texas has only five major cities and only the districts named for those cities are worthy of comparison. Applying those filters gives the statement an element of truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, we identified other districts in the same cities with higher graduation rates than the Austin district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re flipping the Truth-O-Meter&rsquo;s tassel and rating this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
