The&nbsp;expected House vote on March 23, 2017 was postponed a few hours after this fact check was posted.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tax credits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s claim alludes to what are known as refundable tax credits that help people who buy their own health insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How they work: If a person has a federal tax bill of $2,500 and receives a $1,000 tax credit, the tax bill is reduced to $1,500. A refundable tax credit means that if the amount of the tax credit is greater than the amount of taxes owed, the taxpayer receives a refund for the difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Obamacare and the GOP plan, referred to by Democrats as &quot;Trumpcare,&quot; offer the credits. But, as Johnson indicated, they take different approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obamacare:</strong> Tax credits are based on a person&rsquo;s income and the cost of health insurance in the area where they live. The subsidies are available to people whose income is between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (in 2017, 400 percent is about $47,000 per year for an individual). The subsidies are larger for people with lower incomes and for those who live in areas where health care costs are higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GOP plan:</strong> The credits <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/comparing-the-gop-tax-credit-with-obamacares-premium-subsidy-2305136456.html\">vary by age</a> -- people in their 20s would get $2,000 a year, with credits rising to $4,000 for people in their 60s. The eligibility extends to individuals who earn up to $75,000 a year -- a significantly higher income than under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what&rsquo;s the upshot?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The effect on people</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An expert nonprofit organization in health care, the Kaiser Family Foundation, summarizes <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/how-affordable-care-act-repeal-and-replace-plans-might-shift-health-insurance-tax-credits/\">the differences this way</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the GOP plan, lower-income people generally will get reduced tax credits compared to Obamacare -- especially those who are older and live in areas where health care costs more. Meanwhile, more people with higher incomes would become eligible for tax credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the average tax credits for a 40-year-old, according to Kaiser:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Annual income in 2020</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Obamacare tax credits</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>GOP plan tax credits</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$20,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$4,143</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$3,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$40,000*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,021</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$3,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$75,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$3,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$100,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$500</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>(<a href=\"http://kff.org/interactive/tax-credits-under-the-affordable-care-act-vs-replacement-proposal-interactive-map/\">In Milwaukee</a>, the estimate is that the credit would be $1,280 with Obamacare and $3,000 with the GOP plan.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson says the GOP&rsquo;s Obamacare replacement would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also &quot;expand the entitlement&quot; by giving subsidies to higher-income people &quot;that Obamacare never helped.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican plan does offer subsidies, known as refundable tax credits, that are smaller for lower-income people than they are under Obamacare.
