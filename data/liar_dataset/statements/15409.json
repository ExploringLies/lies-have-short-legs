You can read more about our partnership with Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/yournewswirecom/\">Your News Wire</a>, a website that often posts misleading and fake news, repeated information from the conservative website <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/05/16/cnn-ratings-collapse-nearly-30-percent/\">Breitbart</a>, which celebrated a recent drop in CNN&rsquo;s ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your News Wire used real data from Ad Week to show a 29 percent primetime rating drop during the second week of May compared to the same week last year. Then the story declared that as a result of the &quot;nosedive&quot; in ratings &quot;the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story included a photo of what appears to be a CNN studio going up in flames but had no evidence that the network has shut down or plans to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN spokespersons didn&rsquo;t respond to emails seeking comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a ratings drop or spike by a network can be used by networks to boast about their position, ratings for a short period of time don&rsquo;t reveal much about a network&rsquo;s viability. Networks sell ads on longer-term data, so a drop in ratings over a couple of weeks may not mean much. Ratings also must be examined based on news events during the time period in question -- it&#39;s built into the business model that some news weeks are slower than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, during the week of May 8-14, 2017, President Donald Trump fired <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/cnn10/ten-content-weds/index.html\">FBI director James Comey</a> and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/us/five-things-may-9-trnd/index.html\">testified to a Senate panel</a> about Michael Flynn, a former Trump adviser, in the Russia saga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that CNN would shut down is a bit of a fantasy for conservatives who share Trump&rsquo;s allegation that the network is &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump uses the term &quot;fake news&quot; to describe news coverage that is unsympathetic to his administration and his performance, at <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/oct/18/deciding-whats-fake-medias-definition-fake-news-vs/\">PolitiFact we refer to fake news</a> as fabricated content that intentionally masquerades as news coverage of actual events.
