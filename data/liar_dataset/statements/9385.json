Rick Perry opposes a hike in the federal minimum wage. Many Republicans do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our curiosity was stirred by another claim in a May 29, 2014, <a href=\"http://factivists.democrats.org/another-governor-another-scandal/%20\"><u>email to reporters</u></a> from the Democratic National Committee: &quot;Perry not only opposes raising the minimum wage&hellip; he doesn&rsquo;t think there should be one.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None whatsoever?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current Texas minimum wage, tied by law to the federal minimum, <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm#Texas\"><u>is $7.25 an hour</u></a>. Nationally, <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx\"><u>according to</u></a> the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states had minimum wages exceeding the federal minimum as of January 2014, while Delaware&rsquo;s minimum was set to pass the federal minimum as of June 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perry said in a Feb. 21, 2014, <a href=\"http://crossfire.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/21/rick-perry-not-govts-business-to-set-minimum-wage/\"><u>appearance</u></a> on CNN&rsquo;s <em>Crossfire</em>: &quot;I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s business to be setting the minimum wage out there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A week later, Perry elaborated <a href=\"http://www.iptv.org/iowapress/story.cfm/11493/video/ip_20140228_4125_perry_minimum_wage\"><u>on <em>Iowa Press</em></u></a>, a program on Iowa Public Television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked if he would repeal the minimum wage law if it were up to him, Perry said: &quot;I think you leave that to the small businessmen and women. I mean, the competitive nature of the free market works really well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressed to air a repeal position, Perry replied: &quot;I don&rsquo;t know whether I would repeal it or not. But I don&rsquo;t think that the federal government in Washington, D.C., needs to be&hellip; setting... the standard out there. I think&quot; if &quot; it&rsquo;s left to the small businessmen and women of the country, it makes a lot more sense to me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added: &quot;If a state wants to set a minimum wage, that should be that state&rsquo;s prerogative, but not out of Washington, D.C.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perry, asked if he would repeal the state minimum wage in Texas if federal law didn&rsquo;t impose a minimum, said: &quot;I would leave it up to the Legislature to have a conversation on it and have a good debate about it. You know, is this a job creation or is it a job killer? If it&rsquo;s killing jobs, I&rsquo;m not going to be for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we tracked down these appearances, DNC spokeswoman Kiara Pesante offered them up by email as the basis of the group&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Footnote: Perry may not have entertained the prospect of government not setting a minimum wage in the past. According to an Oct. 22, 2006, <em>Houston Chronicle</em> news story on the Texas governor&rsquo;s race that fall, Perry declined to say if he favored raising the state minimum wage (then $5.15) above the federal level; the story said Perry &quot;reiterated his support&quot; for the state&rsquo;s minimum-wage law as written.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Perry&#39;s office about where he stands on this topic and didn&#39;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic committee said Perry doesn&rsquo;t think there should be a federal minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s said that lately.
