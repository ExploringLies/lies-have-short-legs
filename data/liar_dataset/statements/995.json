Olbermann said Gingrich was being hypocritical because his 2009 comments on interrogations conducted by the United States on terrorist extremists were not consistent with his comments from 1997 on torture in China.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n <strong>\n  Gingrich then:\n </strong>\n In 1997, Gingrich was House speaker when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States. Gingrich was concerned about the persecution of religious minorities in China, and broached the topic in a meeting with Jiang.\n</p>\n<p>\n He then released a statement about the meeting:\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;Republican leaders made explicitly clear our unwavering  commitment to human rights and individual liberty. I believe it was vitally  important that we used this opportunity to address the basic lack of freedom &mdash;  speech, liberty, assembly, the press &mdash; in China. ... As I said in China this spring, there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family  of man. There is no place for torture and arbitrary detention. There is no place  for forced confessions. There is no place for intolerance of dissent.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;While we  walked through the Rotunda. I explained to President Jiang how the roots of  American rule of law go back more than 700 years, to the signing of the Magna  Carta.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n <strong>\n  Gingrich now:\n </strong>\n Gingrich appeared on the Fox News Channel show\n <em>\n  On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\n </em>\n on April 26, 2009, and said he wasn't sure whether waterboarding was torture.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;I honestly don't know,&quot; Gingrich told Van Susteren. &quot;I think it's debatable. Lawyers I respect a great deal say it is absolutely within the law; other lawyers say it absolutely is not in the law.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether it's considered torture or not, Gingrich said waterboarding was &quot;something we shouldn't do.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n Gingrich explained that it might be warranted in extreme situations.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;I am exactly where Sen. (John) McCain was. Sen. McCain said there are very rare circumstances where extreme measures should be used. And those circumstances should be personally signed by the president as commander in chief. And a good example is if you pick up somebody who has planted a nuclear weapon in Washington or New York or Los Angeles or Atlanta and you're trying to find out in the next three hours, where is the nuclear weapon, the president of the United States may well authorize remarkably tough measures because 100,000 or a half million lives are at stake.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n (Finally, we should note that Gingrich's view that torture is sometimes acceptable is shared by many Americans. A recent Pew poll found that only 25 percent of respondents said that torture is &quot;never&quot; justified. Seventy-one percent felt that torture was justified rarely, sometimes or often.)\n</p>\n<p>\n So, to measure the flip-flop: Gingrich in the past took a more absolute posture on prisoner treatment, saying that &quot;there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family  of man.&quot; Now he appears to say that it is okay in extreme cases. If Gingrich had argued, like former Vice President Dick Cheney has, that &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; is an effective technique and should be used without hesitation, we would be inclined to give him a Full Flop rating. But Gingrich seems to say that torture should be used only in special cases. So we'll give him a Half Flip.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:46.719418", "ruling_date": "2009-04-28T19:49:06", "ruling_headline": "Gingrich has moderated tone on torture", "ruling_headline_slug": "gingrich-has-moderated-tone-torture", "ruling_link_text": "More a Half Flip than \"bitterest hypocrisy\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n MSNBC,\n <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3719710\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Countdown with Keith Olbermann\n </a>\n , April 27, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Fox News Channel,\n <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,517992,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\n </a>\n (transcript), April 26, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Congressional Press Releases, Speaker's statement on visit of President Jiang (accessed via Nexis), Oct. 30, 1997\n</p>\n<p>\n The Newshour,\n <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec97/china_10-30.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Interview with Chinese President Jiang Zemin\n </a>\n , Oct. 30, 1997\n</p>\n<p>\n Pew Research Center,\n <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1202/torture-terrorists-public-remains-split\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Views about torture remain evenly split\n </a>\n , April 23, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Newt", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 152, "last_name": "Gingrich", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "newt-gingrich", "pants_count": 12, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gingrichcutter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/152/", "total_count": 86, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>On torture.</p>", "statement_context": "a news interview", "statement_date": "2009-04-24", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 105, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/105/", "subject": "Human Rights", "subject_slug": "human-rights", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
