Chris Murphy, D-Conn., found what was a too-good-to-pass-up irony about the firm Trump used to write the letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal,&quot; Murphy said in a May 12 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/863064487808708608\">tweet</a>. The post was certainly popular -- it has been retweeted 56,000 times as of the writing of this fact-check. It also elicited an eye-rolling .GIF from Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the continued interest in possible links between Trump and Russia, we decided to look into Murphy&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Morgan Lewis earned &#39;Russia Law Firm of the Year&#39;&nbsp;title</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/sdillon\">tax</a> <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/williamnelson\">lawyers</a> are partners in the Washington, D.C., office of Morgan Lewis, which employs some 2,000 attorneys in 30 cities around the world, including 40 lawyers and staff in Moscow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the May 12 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3719463-DonaldJTrump-Attorney-Letter.html\">letter</a>, Trump&rsquo;s attorneys generally downplayed the president&rsquo;s ties to Russia, and said Trump&rsquo;s tax returns from the past decade contain no undisclosed income from Russian sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy is correct that Morgan Lewis was once named the &quot;Russia Law Firm of the Year.&quot; This award was bestowed in 2016 by Chambers &amp; Partners, a reputable source of law firm rankings, which cited the firm&rsquo;s work in Russia&rsquo;s energy, finance and technology sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy&rsquo;s spokesman, Chris Harris, also pointed us to <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/news/chambers-partners-names-morgan-lewis-as-russia-law-firm-of-the-year\">an item</a> on Morgan Lewis&rsquo; website trumpeting the accolade, calling it a &quot;prestigious honor&quot; that recognizes its Russia office&rsquo;s excellence in client service, strategic growth and other achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere on Morgan Lewis&rsquo; website the firm <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/locations/moscow\">boasts</a> about its Moscow office, saying &quot;Our lawyers are well known in the Russian market, and have deep familiarity with the local legislation, practices, and key players.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">So what?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So Murphy is basically right on the facts: (1) Trump did use a letter from his Morgan Lewis tax attorneys to downplay Russia ties, (2) Morgan Lewis was named &quot;Russia Law Firm of the Year,&quot; and (3) the firm has extensive Russia ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, it would be wrong to conclude that by hiring Morgan Lewis, Trump shares the firm&rsquo;s extensive Russia ties. That&rsquo;s unproven. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Morgan Lewis spokesman told <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-tax-law-firm-deep-ties-russia/story?id=47376041\">ABC News</a> none of the firm&rsquo;s attorneys have handled any business dealings for Trump in Russia. The spokesman added that Trump&rsquo;s tax attorney, Sheri Dillon, has never been to Russia and does no work there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reality is, beyond a laugh line, there&rsquo;s not much people should read into Murphy&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the same logic, for instance, Trump&rsquo;s tough talk toward Germany would potentially be undermined by the fact his tax attorneys work in a firm that operates an office in <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/locations/frankfurt\">Frankfurt</a>. And unless Murphy were willing to credit Trump for <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/~/media/files/news/2017/bloomberg-remote-working-program-08march17.ashx?la=en\">Morgan Lewis&rsquo; progressive telecommuting policy</a> to help working parents, his position would lack coherence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy said, &quot;Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While any&nbsp;suggestion Trump shares the law firm&#39;s extensive ties is unproven, Murphy has the basic facts correct. The tax attorneys Trump has used to minimize his Russia ties are partners at Morgan Lewis, the 2016 &quot;Russia Law Firm of the Year,&quot; which boasts significant work in Russia. The firm, however, says that Trump&rsquo;s lawyer has done no work in Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Murphy&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-15T16:53:23.639496", "ruling_date": "2017-05-16T14:59:14", "ruling_headline": "Mostly True: Trump uses Russia's 'law firm of the year' to counter claim he's too close to Russia", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-chris-murphy-russian-law-firm-year", "ruling_link_text": "Not much more to it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/863064487808708608\">Tweet</a> by Sen.
