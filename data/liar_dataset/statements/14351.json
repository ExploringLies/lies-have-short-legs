If you don&rsquo;t, you have to pay a penalty or take a waiver. More people, almost twice as many, pay the penalty or take the waiver than signed up for it.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCarthy is correct that Obamacare requires people to have health insurance, unless they pay a penalty or claim an exemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/aca-individual-shared-responsibility-provision-exemptions\">Exemptions</a> are granted based on household income levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we wanted to know: Have almost twice as many people really declined health coverage -- by paying the penalty or taking a waiver -- as signed up for Obamacare?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what counts for a &lsquo;sign-up&rsquo; under Obamacare?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked McCarthy&rsquo;s spokesman for evidence supporting the claim. For the penalty and exemptions, he cited figures from an IRS <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/newsroom/commissionerletteracafilingseason.pdf\">report to Congress</a> based on tax year 2015, the latest year for which numbers are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They show:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>6.5 million people paid a penalty in 2015</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>12.7 million people claimed an exemption in 2015</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Altogether, 19.2 million declined Obamacare coverage that year. These figures are widely accepted by health policy experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Obamacare sign-ups, McCarthy&rsquo;s spokesman cited a 12.2 million figure for the most recent enrollment period. It&rsquo;s based on a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-items/2017-03-15.html\">news release</a>, though health policy experts say it&rsquo;s far from the full picture on Obamacare sign-ups. It shows the number who selected or were automatically re-enrolled in an Obamacare marketplace plan nationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the numbers, 19.2 million is not &quot;almost twice as many&quot; as 12.2 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also the larger question: Are the marketplaces the full picture of Obamacare sign-ups?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Absolutely not, health policy experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;The missing piece&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. The federal law, however, did not go into effect until 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it did, it created two ways to increase the number of people with health insurance in the United States -- the exchanges and an expanded Medicaid program -- said <a href=\"http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/about/Pages/DirectorsMessage.aspx\">Gerald Kominski</a>, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s are closer to 20 million when adding enrollment through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, Kominski said. That figure comes from a <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf\">March 2016 report</a> by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a false statement,&quot; Kominski said of McCarthy&rsquo;s claim. &quot;The category that the congressman conveniently left out of his narrative (is) the roughly 14 million people who were newly enrolled in Medicaid programs around the country. It&rsquo;s the missing piece.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To ignore one category and exclusively focus on the other is disingenuous,&quot; he added. &quot;Either that or it shows a fundamental lack of (understanding) of the law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kominski advocates for the Affordable Care Act as &quot;a great step forward&quot; on his <a href=\"http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/about/Pages/DirectorsMessage.aspx\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s certainly part of Obamacare&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/chpr/profiles/melnikow.html\">Joy Melnikow</a>, Director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, agreed Medicaid can&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s certainly part of Obamacare,&quot; Melnikow said. &quot;It was the bigger piece of what Obamacare did.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two main parts of Obamacare, the marketplaces and Medicaid, are more connected than some might think, she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When someone goes to buy insurance on the exchange, the process solicits information about that individual&rsquo;s income to see if they qualify for Medicaid. If they qualify for Medicaid, the exchange insurance sign-up will route them to sign up for Medicaid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Absolute conclusions?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing an absolute conclusion about how many people signed up for Medicaid because of Obamacare isn&rsquo;t so simple, noted one health researcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s not a clean, easy way to measure who signed up because of the Affordable Care Act,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/person/cynthia-cox/\">Cynthia Cox</a>, who studies the ACA at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not always clear, she added, whether enrollees signed up because they heard about Medicaid expansion under the ACA or for other unrelated reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressman Kevin McCarthy claimed almost twice as many people have paid a penalty or taken a waiver as signed up for Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By focusing only on enrollment through the Obamacare exchanges, McCarthy&rsquo;s claim presents a narrow and misleading look at total insurance sign-ups under the federal health law. Even under the limited view, those foregoing insurance do not amount to &quot;almost twice&quot; the exchange sign-ups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most notably, the congressman&rsquo;s claim ignores the huge category of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Of the 20 million people who gained coverage under Obamacare through early 2016, about 14 million were under Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data show about the same number of people declined coverage -- not &quot;almost twice as many&quot; -- as signed-up for Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate McCarthy&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">more</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>div class=&#39;artembed&#39;&gt;See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-21T19:32:23.910107", "ruling_date": "2017-07-21T16:57:59", "ruling_headline": "Kevin McCarthy's False claim on Obamacare sign-ups", "ruling_headline_slug": "kevin-mccarthys-false-claim-obamacare-sign-ups", "ruling_link_text": "Claim ignores huge Medicaid category", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rep.
