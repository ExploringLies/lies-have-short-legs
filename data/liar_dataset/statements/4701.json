At the time, the state was one of only two that did not allow people to carry concealed weapons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut folks on both sides of the expressed concerns while awaiting detailed rules on how to get a permit. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/35\">The </a><a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/35\">law </a>takes effect Nov. 1, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRA was <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/releases/October11/1005/1005nra.pdf\">upset </a>at rumors that Wisconsin&rsquo;s Department of Justice would require live-fire training and mandate at least four hours of safety instruction overall. Meanwhile, critics feared that online video courses might be deemed enough to get a permit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome of those rumors were unfounded -- permit applicants need not fire a gun (as in Minnesota), and training must be face-to-face with a certified instructor. The four-hour length was approved, though, in the <a href=\"http://www.doj.wi.gov/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/combined-rules17-18-1713-20111020.pdf\">emergency </a><a href=\"http://www.doj.wi.gov/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/combined-rules17-18-1713-20111020.pdf\">rules</a>issued by Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNevertheless, despite the specific rules that drew criticism from gun advocates, Wisconsin&rsquo;s overall law is still in the Top 10 for ease of access to permits, according to Nik Clark, head of <a href=\"http://www.wisconsincarry.org/default.html#\">Wisconsin </a><a href=\"http://www.wisconsincarry.org/default.html#\">Carry </a>Inc., a nonprofit gun-rights organization.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSomething little discussed in the back-and-forth was the fact that applicants can get permits even if their training was years ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that&rsquo;s where the National Rifle Association comes in. The NRA remains unhappy about an issue related to proving an applicant has received past training.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a lobbying alert to its members on Oct.15, 2011, the group&rsquo;s legislative arm said the state Justice Department overstepped by requiring too much <a href=\"http://www.doj.state.wi.us/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/certificate-public-model-20111018.doc\">information on the </a><a href=\"http://www.doj.state.wi.us/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/certificate-public-model-20111018.doc\">certificates </a>needed as proof of firearms safety training.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands,&quot; the NRA alert said. &quot;This renders all existing certificates insufficient for submission with a citizen&rsquo;s license application. &nbsp;DOJ could have easily established a system that would have allowed existing training certificates to be submitted while ensuring that the requirements of the concealed weapons law are met.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRA contends some would-be applicants will be discouraged, or will not be able to track down their instructors to get the required proof (for instance, if an instructor died or moved away). It argues in those cases applicants will have to get retrained because of DOJ&rsquo;s &quot;demands.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat are those demands, and are they unique to the Wisconsin rules?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRA could not provide a state-by-state comparison to back up its claim, so we did a brief survey of states based on governmental and private research. We also interviewed firearms safety trainers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s get armed with some facts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe will not focus on what proof is needed in the case of military, law enforcement or security firearms training, or hunter education courses. The dispute is over proof of training run by groups such as the NRA and other state and national organizations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that case, the DOJ rules require:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tA signed statement from the instructor confirming graduation from a course that meets Wisconsin&rsquo;s general requirements (no specific curriculum is mandated as in some states).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe name, address and phone number of the instructor or organization, the name of the course and where and when it was held.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe name of the organization that certified the instructor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe length of the course.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on our check of permit rules around the country, it&rsquo;s not hard to find states that require some of the same things Wisconsin requires.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe learned of certificates of training that required confirmation of the course length (Missouri); the instructor&rsquo;s name and signature (Michigan, Florida, Minnesota); and a statement attesting to the course meeting state law (Michigan) -- the same things Wisconsin requires.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd it&rsquo;s not hard to find states that seek similar items -- Utah requires instructors to stamp the application, for instance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the other hand, we could find no state that required all of what Wisconsin is seeking. The instructor contact information, in particular, is unusual on the graduation certificate. Some states -- not including Wisconsin -- directly certify instructors and their courses, giving them access to the same information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You&rsquo;re on your own over there,&quot; said Gary Shade, of <a href=\"http://www.shadeslanding.com/\">Shade&rsquo;s Landing</a>, a personal protection and firearms training company in Apple Valley, Minnesota.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition to Shade, we spoke with Bill Schmitz, of <a href=\"http://www.bdj-ltd.com/classes.htm\">BDJ, Ltd</a>. in Redgranite, Wis.; Tim Grant, of <a href=\"http://www.aacfi.com/\">American Association of Certified Firearms Instructors</a>; and Michael Bender of the <a href=\"http://www.ppa-wi.com/\">Personal Protection </a><a href=\"http://www.ppa-wi.com/\">Academy </a>in Madison. All said they would have to re-do their certificates because of the Wisconsin rules.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome complained about it; others said it was no big deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe proof requirements directly affect NRA trainers, who along with instructors from other organizations will have to re-work and re-issue their graduation certificates to meet the specific Wisconsin rules, our research found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis summer, after the law passed but before Van Hollen&rsquo;s rule came out in October, some people jumped the gun and got trained with less than four hours of instruction or got trained through online courses, according to our interviews with several training companies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOthers got enough training but were handed certificates that don&rsquo;t include all the required information. There is time and expense involved for trainees and instructors in going back at this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVan Hollen says the rules are reasonable and an anti-fraud move.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The DOJ&rsquo;s requirements for training certificates allow instructors to verify that the permit applicant named on the certificate actually took the course,&quot; DOJ spokeswoman Dana Brueck told us. &quot;Given the Legislature required &lsquo;proof&rsquo; of training, it only makes sense to have the instructor sign the document.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrueck said the course location verifies the training was face to face.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA final point:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that evaluating the NRA assertion that &quot;no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands&quot; is a matter of how you read the statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes the group mean nobody else asks for &quot;any&quot; of the information Wisconsin does, or that, taken as a whole, no other state seeks all of what we do? NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said it was the latter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur conclusion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRA claimed that &quot;no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found elements in common with what other states require, as well as some that appear to be unique to Wisconsin&rsquo;s rules on certificates. We think it&rsquo;s reasonable to interpret the NRA claim as meaning no other state asks for as much as we do on the certificate, so that part of the statement is basically accurate with some clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group also said the DOJ rules render all existing graduation certificates &quot;insufficient for submission with a citizen&rsquo;s license application.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s ample evidence that is true for courses run by organizations such as the NRA. The NRA&rsquo;s overall point is a technical one, but requires some clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate it Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-28T18:24:18.373051", "ruling_date": "2011-10-31T09:02:01", "ruling_headline": "NRA says Wisconsin\u2019s concealed-carry permit rules require more proof than other states", "ruling_headline_slug": "nra-says-wisconsins-concealed-carry-permit-rules-r", "ruling_link_text": "Law is permissive overall, but strict on proof of training", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNational Rifle Association,<a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Read.aspx?ID=7140\">web alert by NRA&rsquo;s Institute for Legislative Action</a>, Oct. 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Department of Justice, <a href=\"http://www.doj.wi.gov/dles/cib/ConcealedCarry/combined-rules17-18-1713-20111020.pdf\">emergency rules on permit process</a>, accessed Oct. 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam, Oct. 26, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-oks-4-hours-training-for-concealed-carry-permit-131885598.html\">&quot;Walker OKs 4 hours&rsquo; training for concealed carry permit</a>,&quot; Oct. 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Rifle Association, <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/releases/October11/1005/1005nra.pdf\">letter to Attorney General J.B.
