Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat online hoaxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said that on behalf of the U.S. Education Department, Trump&rsquo;s legal team petitioned the court to make America safer. The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that public schools &quot;will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Nowtrump.com (a play on the &quot;never Trump&quot; movement) wrote that according to USA Politics Today, students will learn about Islam, as they do about other religions, in history.

In <em>Abington vs. Schempp</em>, Associate Justice Tom Clark wrote for the court:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It might well be said that one&rsquo;s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowtrump.com wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States &quot;will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been no such ruling banning schools from teaching about Islam or Sharia law.
