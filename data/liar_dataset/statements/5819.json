(That charge was also levied <a href=\"http://townhall.com/tipsheet/deanbarnett/2007/05/01/mitt_and_osama/print\">back in 2007</a> about the Associated Press story that quoted Romney in the first place.) <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/30/obama-campaign-bin-laden-ad-omits-romney-clarification-on-key-quote/\">Fox News followed</a>, saying &quot;Obama campaign&#39;s bin Laden ad omits Romney clarification on key quote.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered:&nbsp;Did the ad accurately characterize Romney&rsquo;s &quot;heaven and earth&quot; quote? Was he really lukewarm &mdash; or even opposed &mdash; to the effort to get bin Laden?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>The AP interview</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no dispute that Romney said about bin Laden, &quot;It&#39;s not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut was he saying he wouldn&rsquo;t pursue the terrorist?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe quote comes from an Associated Press story on April 26, 2007, about a Romney interview with reporter Liz Sidoti that covered a range of topics. Here&rsquo;s the related passage:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>In the interview, Romney also:</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>Said the country would be safer by only &quot;a small percentage&quot; and would see &quot;a very insignificant increase in safety&quot; if al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was caught because another terrorist would rise to power. &quot;It&#39;s not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person,&quot; Romney said. Instead, he said he supports a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the time, Democrats such as Obama were criticizing President George W. Bush for failing to find bin Laden. Republicans, in turn, were critical of Obama&#39;s focus on capturing or killing the terrorist leader.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA post from the conservative site <a href=\"http://townhall.com/tipsheet/deanbarnett/2007/05/01/mitt_and_osama/\">Townhall.com</a> in 2007 says it got a transcript from Romney&rsquo;s campaign at the time that shows he followed the &quot;heaven and earth&quot; line with the sentence: &quot;It is worth fashioning and executing an effective strategy to defeat global, violent Jihad and I have a plan for doing that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater, he explains, &quot;Global jihad &hellip; involves millions of people and is going to require a far more comprehensive strategy than a targeted approach for bin Laden or a few of his associates.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSidoti, now AP&rsquo;s political editor, couldn&rsquo;t confirm the accuracy of the transcript for us, and Romney&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our inquiry. Lucky for us, Romney himself had a chance to clarify his words just days after he spoke them, in a May 4, 2007, Republican presidential debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe moderator of the MSNBC debate, which featured nine Republicans, brought up Romney&rsquo;s &quot;heaven and earth&quot; quote, which rival Arizona Sen. John McCain had called &quot;naive.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> &quot;Gov. Romney, respond to the mentioned reference to you ... by Sen. McCain.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em><strong>ROMNEY:</strong> &quot;Thank you. Of course we get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> &quot;Can we move heaven and earth to do it?&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em><strong>ROMNEY: </strong>&quot;We&#39;ll move everything to get him. But I don&#39;t want to buy into the Democratic pitch that this is all about one person &mdash; Osama bin Laden &mdash; because after we get him, there&#39;s going to be another and another. This is about Shia and Sunni. This is about Hezbollah and Hamas and al-Qaida and the Muslim Brotherhood. This is a worldwide jihadist effort to try and cause the collapse of all moderate Islamic governments and replace them with a caliphate.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>&quot;They ultimately want to bring down the United States of America.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>&quot;This is a global effort we&#39;re going to have to lead to overcome this jihadist effort. It&#39;s more than Osama bin Laden.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>&quot;But he is going to pay, and he will die.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat suggests Romney was criticizing Democrats for focusing too much on the al-Qaida leader rather than the full organization and would have aggressively pursued bin Laden in the context of a larger antiterror strategy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Romney suggested just a few months later that he wouldn&rsquo;t do what Obama ultimately did &mdash; call for a secret, unilateral Navy SEALs strike inside Pakistan. In 2007, Obama had said that if he were elected president, he would be willing to launch strikes against al-Qaida targets in Pakistan with or without Pakistan&rsquo;s approval.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn Aug. 4, 2007, headline from Reuters &mdash; an article cited by Obama&rsquo;s ad &mdash; says, &quot;Romney attacks Obama over Pakistan warning.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney called Obama&#39;s comments &lsquo;ill-timed&rsquo; and &lsquo;ill-considered,&rsquo;&quot; Reuters reported, along with <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/08/05/romney_targets_obama_over_pakistan/\">o</a><a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/08/05/romney_targets_obama_over_pakistan/\">ther news services.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world,&quot; Romney said, according to Reuters. &quot;We want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme with them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRomney &quot;said U.S. troops &lsquo;shouldn&#39;t be sent all over the world.&#39;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther Republicans (and Democrat Hillary Clinton) had the same complaint, with some going so far as to say Obama &quot;wants to bomb Pakistan,&quot; a statement we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/21/john-mccain/a-distortion-of-what-obama-said/\">Pants on Fire</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign, on the other hand, had issued a memo that the United States had deferred to the Pakistani president&rsquo;s judgment long enough, and that, &quot;Barack Obama wants to turn the page,&quot; Reuters reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn Obama campaign ad suggested Mitt Romney wouldn&rsquo;t have agressively pursued Osama bin Laden by citing Romney&#39;s statement that, &quot;It&#39;s not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign is right that Romney used those words, but by cherry-picking them, it glosses over comments describing his broader approach. Romney said he wanted to pursue all of al-Qaida, not just its leaders.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe reporter quoting him in April 2007 said he instead &quot;endorsed a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement.&quot; And he said just over a week later that he would &quot;get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America &hellip; he is going to pay, and he will die.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Romney was clear later that summer that he would prefer to participate with allies rather than take unilateral action to kill terrorists as Obama supported &mdash; and later did. The ad takes Romney&rsquo;s words out of context, but gets part of the story right.
