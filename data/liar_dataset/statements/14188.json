Clovis is the Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-clovis-1702a97\">senior White House adviser</a>, but reportedly lacks a science background. He has a doctorate in public administration, has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150322160314/https:/www.morningside.edu/about-morningside/directory/sam-clovis/\">taught</a> business, management and public policy at Morningside College in Iowa, hosted a conservative radio show and was a Trump campaign policy adviser.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has he disparaged scientists as USPOLN.com said? Facebook users flagged the post as potential fake news. We found that quotes attributed to Clovis are indeed fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com calls itself a &quot;<a href=\"http://uspoln.com/about-us/\">hybrid News/Satire platform</a>,&quot; and we&rsquo;ve included it in our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/\">list</a> of websites that deliberately post false or fake stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A disclaimer in its &quot;About Us&quot; page plainly tells readers its intentions and accuracy: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don&rsquo;t necessarily exist. These Articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USPOLN.com story about Clovis heavily borrows, almost verbatim, multiple paragraphs from a May 12 <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trumps-expected-pick-for-top-usda-scientist-is-not-a-scientist\">report</a> from ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit, investigative journalism website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com&rsquo;s opening sentences:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the &lsquo;chief scientist&rsquo; is supposed to be the leader &lsquo;among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.&rsquo; President Donald Trump&rsquo;s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ProPublica&rsquo; first few sentences:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;The USDA&rsquo;s research section studies everything from climate change to nutrition. Under the 2008 Farm Bill, its leader is supposed to serve as the agency&rsquo;s &lsquo;chief scientist&rsquo; and be chosen &quot;from among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;But Sam Clovis &mdash; who, according to sources with knowledge of the appointment and members of the agriculture trade press, is President Trump&rsquo;s pick to oversee the section &mdash; appears to have no such credentials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;Clovis has never taken a graduate course in science and is openly skeptical of climate change. While he has a doctorate in public administration and was a tenured professor of business and public policy at Morningside College for 10 years, he has published almost no academic work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com&rsquo;s post takes a satirical turn when it starts &quot;quoting&quot; Clovis on his comments about his credentials in an assumed interview with &quot;KYXL Radio&quot; (searches on the Federal Communications Commission website for a radio station with those call letters yielded <a href=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=KYXL&amp;arn=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;freq=0.0&amp;fre2=107.9&amp;serv=&amp;vac=&amp;facid=&amp;asrn=&amp;class=&amp;list=0&amp;ThisTab=Results+to+This+Page%2FTab&amp;dist=&amp;dlat2=&amp;mlat2=&amp;slat2=&amp;NS=N&amp;dlon2=&amp;mlon2=&amp;slon2=&amp;EW=W&amp;size=9\">zero</a> <a href=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=KYXL&amp;arn=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;freq=530&amp;fre2=1700&amp;type=0&amp;facid=&amp;class=&amp;list=1&amp;ThisTab=Results+to+This+Page%2FTab&amp;dist=&amp;dlat2=&amp;mlat2=&amp;slat2=&amp;NS=N&amp;dlon2=&amp;mlon2=&amp;slon2=&amp;EW=W&amp;size=9\">results</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The satirical website said Clovis &quot;argued that he was &lsquo;proud&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t have any scientific credentials or education, because &lsquo;scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead (sic) individuals anyway&rsquo;.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also falsely claims Clovis said he thanks God he did not make him a scientist and that he&rsquo;s proud not to be one &quot;because they believe in things like evolution and the like.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com <a href=\"http://politicops.com/trumps-top-scientist-pick-scientists-just-dumb-regular-people-think-dinosaurs-existed-earth-getting-warmer/\">links</a> as its &quot;source&quot; another &quot;hybrid News/Satire&quot; site that has the same article posted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the USDA to confirm if Clovis was Trump&rsquo;s pick for the chief scientist job. The department said it could not comment in advance on any nominations for Senate-confirmed positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about the quotes from USPOLN.com?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Completely fabricated,&quot; the department&rsquo;s communications office said, linking to a <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/sam-clovis-scientists-dumb/\">Snopes review</a> of the story deeming the comments false.
