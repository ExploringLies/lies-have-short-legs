The move delayed a vote on Republican Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s budget-repair bill, which curtails the collective bargaining power of most state and local government employees, although the bill eventually became law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCourt challenges have kept the collective bargaining changes from taking effect. But the law, and the Democrats&rsquo; reaction to it, spurred a recall movement of <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/117804138.html\">historic proportions</a>.

We interviewed 10 of the people who called. Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe calls began days after the Holperin recall committee <a href=\"http://gab.wi.gov/elections-voting/recall\">filed</a> its petitions in Madison on April 21, 2011. Some people said they received one call, while others said they received two or more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMany of the people, including five we interviewed, said the callers identified themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSome of the people said the callers identified themselves as being from Minnesota. And one caller, when pressed by a woman he called, said he was being paid by <a href=\"http://www.callmeyer.com/meyer-teleservices-about-us.php\">Meyer Teleservices</a>, a telemarketing company in St. Cloud, Minn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tNearly everyone who contacted us said they were asked if they understood what they had signed. &quot;It was questions as though, &lsquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?&rsquo; It was very irritating,&quot; said Robert Means of Eagle River. Others said the callers were polite and they didn&rsquo;t feel harassed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSome people said the callers told them that some people had been misled about what they were signing. &quot;They stated the signers were lied to on what the petitions were for,&quot; said Jeff Kirschmann of Eagle River, one of five people we interviewed who signed petitions and also circulated them. &quot;It really irritates me that they called us liars.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose statements back the claim made by Simac.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat did Holperin and the Democrats have to say about it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolperin said he authorized the Wisconsin Democratic Party to call about 5,000 of the people who signed recall petitions against him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGraeme Zielinski, spokesman for the party, said the Minnesota telemarketing firm was hired to call people who signed petitions against Holperin and against two other Democrats who are facing possible recall elections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolperin said he authorized the calls because, although petition circulators who worked under Simac were &quot;earnest, honest and friendly,&quot; more than a third of the 23,000 signatures were collected by <a href=\"http://www.kennedyenterprises.us/\">Kennedy Enterprises</a>, a Colorado marketing and consulting firm hired by the Wisconsin Republican Party. Those petition circulators were often aggressive and misleading when they asked residents to sign petitions, Holperin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to Holperin, 534 petition signers -- about 10 percent of those who were called by the Minnesota telemarketing firm -- said they were given misleading information and that they asked to have their names removed from the petitions. He said that was the basis for a <a href=\"http://gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/Memorandum%20in%20Supp%20of%20Sen.%20Holperin%20Challenge.pdf\">complaint</a> he filed with the Government Accountability Board challenging the petitions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolperin provided a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/HolperinScript-2.pdf\">script</a> that he said the firm used in asking questions of people who signed recall petitions against him. The script shows that, among other things, callers were to: identify themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party; ask people whether they were aware their signatures appeared on a Holperin recall petition; and state that reports had been received that &quot;out-of-state paid circulators were misleading people about what they were being asked to sign.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So, did we &lsquo;insinuate&rsquo; that foul play had occurred?,&quot; Holperin said. &quot;You bet we did, and we think we offered ample evidence that backs up our claim.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s wrap up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimac said people who signed Holperin recall petitions received &quot;harassing phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers claiming to represent the Democratic Party and insinuating foul play by petition circulators.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome people who received calls said they felt harassed even if they received just one call because they didn&rsquo;t expect to be questioned about signing a petition. The callers were employed by an out-of-state firm, they did identify themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party and did claim that petition circulators misled signers of the petitions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Simac&rsquo;s claim as True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-17T17:24:52.790077", "ruling_date": "2011-05-18T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin tea party leader says Democrat-hired telemarketer called recall petition signers", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-tea-party-leader-says-democrat-hired-tel", "ruling_link_text": "This claim checks out", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCommittee to Recall Jim Holperin, &quot;Out-of-state telemarketers paid by Democratic Party harass 12th District constituents&quot; <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=234932\">news release</a>, April 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Jim Buckley of Antigo, May 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Charlie Gullan of Eagle River, May 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Barbara Keen of Antigo, May 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Jeff Kirschmann of Eagle River, May 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Robert Means of Eagle River, May 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Pat Powell of Antigo, May 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Pat Powell of Antigo, May 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Dennis Van Ooyen of Antigo, May 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Paula Visner of Eagle River, May 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Jane Wierschem of Minocqua, May 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Carl Adkins of Crivitz, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Joan Benishek of Antigo, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Roy Kleisch of Antigo, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Jim Novak of Eagle River, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Tracey Novak of Antigo, May 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Ann Rozga of Eagle River, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Bessie Steger of Antigo, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail from Earl Steger of Antigo, May 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/121843068.html\">&quot;Recall signature drive ending Monday,&quot;</a> May 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/117804138.html\">&quot;State recall movement stands alone in U.S. history,&quot;</a> March 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Government Accountability Board, Sen.
