Among the victims was our late Ambassador Chris Stevens. I mean what she did with him was absolutely horrible. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed. That&rsquo;s right. When the phone rang, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ_z9Tpdl9A\">as per the commercial</a>, at 3:00 in the morning, Hillary Clinton was sleeping.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/04/27/donald-trump-benghazi-hillary-clinton-decided-go-home-sleep/\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">made this&nbsp;claim</a>&nbsp;before.&nbsp;Was Clinton really asleep in her bed Sept. 11, 2012, while terrorists killed four Americans in the Libyan city of Benghazi?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. The, attack took place at about 9:30 p.m. Benghazi time, or 3:30 in the afternoon Washington time on a Tuesday. Clinton was at her State Department office. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/12/hillary-clinton/clinton-there-have-been-7-benghazi-probes-so-far/\">numerous congressional investigations into the attacks</a> have faulted Clinton for her actions as the attacks unfolded that day or said she could have done something different on Sept. 12 that would have saved lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For her part, Clinton has said in her memoir <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=8gzFAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=323#v=snippet&amp;q=323&amp;f=false\">Hard Choices</a></em> and in <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-114hhrg98884/html/CHRG-114hhrg98884.htm\">congressional testimony</a> that she worked late into the night and did not sleep, though she did work from her Washington home for at least part of the night. We cannot independently confirm what she did that night, but we do know she released a <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/09/197628.htm\">public statement</a> after 10 p.m. and emailed her daughter, Chelsea, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/08/with-2-a-m-state-department-email-trove-82-percent-of-clinton-emails-now-released/\">after 11 p.m.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The military, not the State Department, was in charge of responding to the attacks as they unfolded. At that time, the military had a limited presence in North Africa, but congressional investigations concluded that it did the best it could on the night of the attack with the resources available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Given the military&rsquo;s preparations on Sept. 11, 2012, majority members have not yet discerned any response alternatives that could have likely changed the outcome of the Benghazi attack,&quot; found the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151025184646/http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=A4AE38EF-0A61-48B1-B08A-48C5D6C2F0CC\">House Armed Services Committee</a> in a 2014 report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report and another by the <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/press/benghazi.pdf \">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> found that no outside parties &mdash; such as the State Department or the White House &mdash; hindered the military nor the intelligence community in their immediate defensive response to the attacks as they unfolded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a while after the attack, some Republican members of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/14/jason-chaffetz/rep-jason-chaffetz-says-special-forces-ready-save-/\">Congress</a> claimed an official &mdash; some speculated Clinton &nbsp;&mdash; told military or intelligence personnel to &quot;stand down&quot; while the attack occurred.
