John Cornyn touts a Texas-tested method to address backlogged veterans&rsquo; disability claims, a problem he recently highlighted on Twitter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Nov. 19, 2012, the Texas Republican <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncornyn/status/270488863246524416\">tweeted</a>, &quot;Veterans&#39; disability claims backlog had doubled during POTUS&#39;s first term. He needs to announce a plan to reduce it. ASAP.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReducing the Department of Veterans Affairs backlog was <a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/975b85c9939790ce2e_kr41mvuq5.pdf\">one of the campaign promises</a> Barack Obama made in 2008 as he ran for POTUS (president of the United States). PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken in a Nov. 2, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/114/reduce-the-veterans-benefits-administration-claims/\">article</a> that delved into some of the reasons the problem had grown worse.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe term &quot;backlog&quot; is used in this context as shorthand for claims that have gone unaddressed by the government for 125 days involving military veterans&rsquo; disability compensation and pensions and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die because of their military service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact said the nationwide backlog &quot;nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012,&quot; due in part to the influx of veterans returning from war in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas&rsquo; backlog doubled from July 2010 to July 2012, the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> reported in a July 16, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/backlog-of-benefits-claims-for-texas-veterans-has-/nRqB2/\">news story</a>. And the VA claims office in Waco has both the nation&rsquo;s longest wait and the nation&rsquo;s largest backlog, according to an Aug. 14, 2012, <em>Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/special-reports/central-texas-veterans-face-nations-longest-wait-f/nRNH2/\">article</a> and Cornyn&rsquo;s Nov. 12, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.wacotrib.com/opinion/columns/178777531.html\">opinion column</a> in the <em>Waco Tribune-Herald</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCornyn&rsquo;s legislation, according to his Nov. 28, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.cornyn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=InNews&amp;ContentRecord_id=e7806f97-d32e-43de-a4e8-85f66c572305&amp;ContentType_id=b94acc28-404a-4fc6-b143-a9e15bf92da4&amp;f6c645c7-9e4a-4947-8464-a94cacb4ca65&amp;Group_id=bf378025-1557-49c1-8f08-c5df1c4313a4\">press release</a>, would require the VA to come up with a national plan similar to its recent partnership with the Texas Veterans&rsquo; Commission, which assists veterans with their claims individually.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie for details on the senator&rsquo;s tweet about Obama&rsquo;s first term, which began Jan. 20, 2009. His second term begins Jan. 21, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrandewie emailed us data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Looking at numbers from the department&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.vba.va.gov/REPORTS/mmwr/index.asp\">weekly reports</a>, Brandewie said, there were 86,687 backlogged claims on Jan. 24, 2009, and 597,636 on Nov. 17, 2012. That, we calculated, is a 589 percent increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, Brandewie noted, there&rsquo;s a hitch in those numbers. Before October 2009, he said, the VA considered a claim backlogged if it had gone unaddressed for more than 180 days. Then the department raised the bar. Beginning that month, a claim was backlogged if it had been pending for more than 125 days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat meant a lot of claims were immediately reclassified as backlogged. The agency&rsquo;s Sept. 26, 2009, report has 88,195 claims older than 180 days; the next report, issued Oct. 3, 2009, has 158,290 claims pending for more than 125 days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if 180-day-late claims had doubled on Obama&rsquo;s watch, but the VA reports stopped including that statistic after the 2009 change. As an alternative, we checked the longest span of days we could get with the 125-day measure -- Oct. 3, 2009 to Nov. 17, 2012. The result: a 278 percent increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVeterans&rsquo; Affairs spokesman Randy Noller, whom we interviewed by phone, sent us data that matches the numbers Brandewie sent us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrandewie also pointed out that the backlog had doubled in another way: as a percentage of the whole. Two years ago, less than a third of all such veterans&rsquo; claims were pending. Now, more than two-thirds of all claims are pending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy did the backlog increase so much? Noller told us, &quot;We&rsquo;ve got more claims being filed now than ever before.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact said the VA added staff, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to keep up with a sharp increase in claims volume, much less reduce the past backlog.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe undersecretary for the Veterans Benefits Administration, Allison Hickey, said the volume of claims rose 48 percent from 2008 through 2011 -- from 888,000 to 1.3 million -- in <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-18-12-Hickey-Testimony.pdf\">testimony</a> to a U.S. House subcommittee July 18, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s despite a decline in the number of veterans, which dropped about 6 percent in the same period -- &nbsp;from 23.4 million in 2008 to 22.2 million in 2011 by the department&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/VETDATA/docs/Demographics/VetPop07-ES-final.pdf\">VetPop estimates</a> and from 23.2 million <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb09-ff21.html\">in 2008</a> to 21.5 million <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb12-ff21.html\">in 2011</a> according to the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNoller told us &quot;ten years&rsquo; worth of war&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan is a large factor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause of advances in technology and tactics, &quot;more of our people are coming back alive,&quot; he said, and they report more medical conditions per person than their Vietnam and World War II predecessors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose older veterans face additional problems of their own as they age, according to a Sept. 27, 2012, <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/us/veterans-wait-for-us-aid-amid-growing-backlog-of-claims.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">news story</a>. &quot;The department is administering pensions for World War II veterans while handling new claims from Vietnam veterans struggling with the multiplying ailments of age,&quot; the story said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn her testimony, Hickey said another major contributor to the backlog pile-up has been claims involving <a href=\"http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/basics.asp\">Agent Orange</a>, a herbicide the U.S. sprayed to reduce vegetation providing enemy cover in Vietnam.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Aug. 4, 2012, <em>Statesman</em> news story said rules adopted in 2010 made it easier for Vietnam veterans to file claims based on post-traumatic stress disorder and exposure to Agent Orange.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Times</em> story said that even though Veterans Affairs &quot;added nearly 4,000 new workers since 2008, the agency did not keep pace.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCornyn said the backlog of veterans&rsquo; claims doubled in Obama&rsquo;s first term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCounting from Jan. 24, 2009, forward yields an increase of 589 percent. This is an overstatement, though, since the government lowered its threshold for declaring a claim as backlogged after Obama became president. Still, the backlog has tripled since the lower threshold was imposed in October 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe often find fault in claims that assign the responsibility for broad results to a particular officeholder. That&rsquo;s because many factors are usually at play. In this instance, however, Obama promised to reduce the backlog of claims and PolitiFact recently rated this a promise Broken. In turn, we rate Cornyn&rsquo;s statement as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-28T17:48:41.613681", "ruling_date": "2012-11-28T16:57:04", "ruling_headline": "John Cornyn says veterans\u2019 disability claims backlog doubled in Obama\u2019s first term", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-cornyn-says-veterans-disability-claims-backlo", "ruling_link_text": "Obama broke a promise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncornyn/status/270488863246524416\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.23026493646846247\">Tweet</a> from U.S. Sen.
