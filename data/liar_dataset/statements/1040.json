And what do the taxpayers get? They&rsquo;ll get stuck with up to a $50 billion tab for the taxpayer dollars Obama is using to pay for his takeover of GM.&quot;\n <br />\n <br />\n In its bankruptcy filing, the company said it has $172.81 billion in debt and $82.29 billion in assets &mdash; all that despite a $20 billion General Motors has already received from the government, money that was initially earmarked for buying bad mortgages from banks.\n <br />\n <br />\n Now, the company will adopt a restructuring plan that is &quot;tailored to the realities of today's auto market,&quot; said Obama. It's &quot;a plan that positions GM to move toward profitability, even if it takes longer than expected for our economy to fully recover; and it's a plan that builds on GM's recent progress in making better cars.&quot;\n <br />\n <br />\n So, there's no dispute that the government is invested in General Motors &mdash; it has already shelled out $20 billion in loans &mdash; but is Steele correct about the government's new financial ties to the ailing company?\n <br />\n <br />\n We assume that by referring to President Obama owning 60 percent of the automaker, Steele means that the government as a whole will own that stake under the restructuring plan. In fact, the White House was the first to state this fact, during a May 31 briefing with reporters. By the administration's own words, the RNC is correct on this point.\n <br />\n <br />\n Steele goes on to say that Obama's &quot;union buddies will own almost 20 percent.&quot; To be exact, the United Auto Workers will get 17.5 percent of General Motor's common stock, plus cash to help pay for a $20 billion health care trust fund for retirees. Whether this is a boon to Obama's &quot;union buddies,&quot; as Steele's statement says, is a matter of opinion. However, it's worth noting that the UAW endorsed Obama for president and spent more than $4 million to assist his candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n <br />\n <br />\n So Steele is right that the administration will have a 60 percent ownership in the new General Motors and that the union will have nearly 20 percent. Steele earns a True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:43.645937", "ruling_date": "2009-06-01T17:36:56", "ruling_headline": "RNC chairman Michael Steele claims that the government will be part owner of General Motors", "ruling_headline_slug": "rnc-chairman-michael-steele-claims-government-will", "ruling_link_text": "Steele gets it right on General Motors", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n White House,\n <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Background-Briefing-on-GM-Restructuring-May-31-2009/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Background on General Motors Restructuring Plan\n </a>\n , accessed June 1, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n White House,\n <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-General-Motors-Restructuring/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  President Obama's Remarks on General Motors Restructuring Plan\n </a>\n , accessed June 1, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Associated Press,\n <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090601/ap_on_bi_ge/us_automakers\" target=\"_blank\">\n  General Motors Files for Bankruptcy Protection\n </a>\n , by Dan Strumpf and Kimberly S.
