The House <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/990/all-actions?overview=closed&amp;q=%7B%22roll-call-vote%22%3A%22all%22%7D\">vote</a> on the resolution was 244-35 with 18 Democrats joining Republicans favoring the proposal and 34 voting against it, The Hill <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/397678-house-backs-resolution-expressing-support-for-ice\">reported</a>--with another 133 Democrats voting &quot;present&quot; as urged by Democratic leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The leadership &quot;strategy was aimed at both protecting vulnerable Democrats from a contentious vote,&quot; The Hill said,&nbsp;&quot;and protesting what most Democrats deemed a political stunt designed to distract the media and the public from Congress&rsquo;s failure to enact immigration reforms, including efforts to address the separation of migrant families on the U.S.-Mexico border,&quot; its story said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The morning after the House action, Bartiromo asked Williams: &quot;How do you justify voting &lsquo;present?&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams replied: &quot;Well, I never voted &lsquo;present.&rsquo; So I don&rsquo;t know that I can justify it. It&rsquo;s the chicken way out is the only way I know we can put it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Checking vote histories</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t divine a way to plumb a government website to determine if Williams, who joined the House in 2013, had never voted &quot;present.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to our inquiry, <a href=\"https://razor.occams.info/\">Joshua Tauberer</a>, founder of <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/\">GovTrack.us</a>, a site that compiles congressional votes, confirmed Williams&rsquo;s statement. Tauberer said by email that Williams, who as of late July 2018 had been eligible to vote in 3,604 roll-call votes, &quot;has never voted &lsquo;present,&rsquo; except in quorum calls where &lsquo;present&rsquo; is the only vote one can make.&quot; Tauberer told us he reached his conclusion by querying the site&rsquo;s internal database of votes, which he described as built in part from member votes posted by the <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov\">House clerk</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious too about other Texas members voting &quot;present.&quot; On that front, Tauberer emailed us a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQX6iOveUlrIruGPWvKQEdxdDW7GNlBT6N2azIkoTVAx58d4xAVii90cbsYEy73OyRE3eNR9QMX5d1U/pubhtml\">spreadsheet</a> showing more than 1,900 &quot;present&quot; votes by Texans since 1990, though most weren&rsquo;t substantive, we found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sifted the provided information to find that 26 Texas members, from both parties, accounted for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zYek7Kxovx-Ek7OsfncQdhEksHEjWGYrM1eBp7BtiQM/edit?usp=sharing\">more than 680 non-procedural votes</a> of &quot;present&quot; since 1990 with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, leading the delegation with 84 votes of &quot;present&quot; &nbsp;followed by Democratic Rep. Gene Green of Houston, with 61. According to our sort, Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis placed third with 59 &quot;present&quot; votes; he was trailed by GOP Reps. Sam Johnson of Plano and Lamar Smith of San Antonio, with 57 &quot;present&quot; votes each, and Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, who voted &quot;present&quot; 50 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sifted the&nbsp;information even more to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQx_xerYJhkkEa8MKIWeYDeEiC7aoW2l53vD82Q7TOQMzslUXuD7ITIwOgdUxEPpSDQw3vkysIKNoyI/pubhtml\">find</a> that since Williams joined the House in 2013, 11 House Democrats had voted &quot;present&quot; 20 times across nine issues -- topped by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, doing so five times. Most recently, the results show, Reps. Green and Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen each voted &quot;present&quot; on the ICE resolution that Williams supported. Since 2013, the information indicates, no Texas Republicans in the House voted &quot;present&quot; on non-procedural issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Outside analyst</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we asked an expert on Congress generally about the prevalence and significance of &quot;present&quot; votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://polisci.wustl.edu/steven_smith\">Steven Smith</a>, a Washington University political scientist, said by email that party strategy or an individual&rsquo;s political calculation often underlie the semi-rare &quot;present&quot; votes. &quot;At times, a legislator may want to avoid committing to the &lsquo;yea&rsquo; or &lsquo;nay&rsquo; position without reducing his or her rate of voting participation,&quot; Smith wrote. &quot;The legislator will be counted as having voted but without having committed to either side. This probably can be rationalized as having unacceptable alternatives, but it avoids adding a vote for or against a cause, group or constituency,&quot; Smith said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams said he&rsquo;s never voted &quot;present&quot; instead of taking a position on issues before the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s backed up by research we elicited from&nbsp;the founder of the GovTrack.us website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.
