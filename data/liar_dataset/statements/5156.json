She used collective bargaining with unions to achieve savings on employee costs, while Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature used legislation to force most state and local employees to pay more for benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s check Falk&rsquo;s more specific claim -- that she reduced salaries and health benefits of Dane County employees by about $10 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Falk spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence. She provided comments attributed to Dane County director of administration <a href=\"http://www.countyofdane.com/admin/\">Travis Myren</a> that detailed $9.4 million in reductions, so we decided to contact him directly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMyren has been director of administration since being <a href=\"http://www.countyofdane.com/press/details.aspx?id=1674\">promoted</a> from deputy director by Falk in April 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMyren said the $9.4 million in savings were the result of three Falk initiatives that were agreed to by public employee unions and then applied to non-union employees, so that all 2,200 county workers were covered. He also cited a fourth agreement that would put the savings over $10 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2009: Temporary pay cut -- $3.6 million</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalk and the employee unions agreed to cut wages 5 percent for six months, saving $3.6 million. The deal was <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/CB+Minutes+6-18-09.pdf\">approved</a> by the county Board of Supervisors in June 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn exchange, employees got 48 additional hours of &quot;personal leave&quot; time -- paid time off that had to be taken within certain deadlines. The only way that could create a cost to the county is if employees used that additional leave instead of vacation days, banked those unused vacation days and then were paid in cash for them upon terminating their employment with the county, Myren said. &nbsp;He said there is no way to estimate how much, if any, such payouts the county might one day make.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the county saved $3.6 million with the 2009 pay cut, though it could face some higher cash payouts for vacation days down the road.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2010: Temporary pay cut -- $4.7 million</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the 5 percent pay cut expired, putting salaries back at their previous level, Falk and the unions agreed to cut pay 3 percent for one year, saving $4.7 million. That deal was <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/CB+Minutes+12-3-09.pdf\">approved </a>by the County Board in December 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn exchange, the county agreed to no layoffs in 2010 and a number of other benefit enhancements, including 64 more hours of personal leave; increasing by 50 the number of hours employees can bank in sick leave, which can be used to buy health insurance after retirement; and senior employees got three extra vacation days per year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, although the county granted some benefit improvements, it saved another $4.7 million in salaries with the 2010 pay cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2011: Health insurance changes -- $1.1 million</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA new employee contract for 2012 through 2014 require employees to pay more for their health benefits. For example, a co-pay for doctor office visits was created and higher deductibles are imposed for certain services. The changes were <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/CB+Minutes+1-6-11.pdf\">approved</a> by the County Board in January 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMyren said the changes reduced the county&rsquo;s premiums by $900,000 and the additional employee contributions are projected to save another $200,000, for a total savings of $1.1 million for 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn exchange, the county agreed to remove a cap on the pension contributions it makes for employees -- potentially exposing the county to higher pension costs through 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPension funding for Wisconsin public employees is somewhat complicated. A formula, which changes annually, determines what percentage of an employee&rsquo;s salary is to be contributed to the pension by the employer and what percentage by the employee. However, Dane County, as many public employers in Wisconsin have long done, makes both contributions; in 2011, the employee portion was 5.8 percent of the employee&rsquo;s salary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the 2012-2014 contract, the county agreed to eliminate a 6.5 percent cap on the employee contribution that was in the previous contract. So, if the pension funding formula changes and puts the employee contribution higher than 6.5 percent, the county would have a higher pension cost than under the previous contract. State pension <a href=\"http://etf.wi.gov/employers/wrs_contribution_rates.htm\">figures</a> show the employee contribution for most public employees -- including all non-elected Dane County employees -- was 5 percent from 1989 through 2011, but that it rose to 5.9 percent in 2012 after the Walker-led legislation took effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStarting in 2015, after the current contract ends, Dane County employees will be subject to the Walker-led collective bargaining legislation and will be forced to contribute to their pensions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the county is exposing itself to potentially higher pension costs through 2014 in exchange for $1.1 million in immediate health insurance savings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Voluntary leave without pay&quot; program</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe two pay cuts and the health insurance savings total $9.4 million in reductions in salaries and health benefits -- or, more precisely, the cost of health benefits. That&rsquo;s just short of the &quot;about $10 million&quot; claimed by Falk. But Myren said another Falk initiative negotiated with the unions -- &quot;voluntary leaves&quot; -- also should be considered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoluntary leaves -- which differ from personal leaves in that they are days off without pay -- were created in 2003. Through 2011, personal leaves saved the county $1.45 million, Myren said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat would put the total Falk-led employee savings at nearly $11 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ran all of this past two of Falk&rsquo;s political foes on the Dane County Board, supervisors <a href=\"http://www.countyofdane.com/board/supervisor.aspx?district=25\">Eileen </a><a href=\"http://www.countyofdane.com/board/supervisor.aspx?district=25\">Bruskewitz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.countyofdane.com/board/supervisor.aspx?district=15\">Ronn Ferrell</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey described Falk as a friend of public employee unions, pointing out that under the current contract she negotiated, union employees got 3 percent raises at the end of 2011; and that, unlike other local governments, the county can&#39;t use until 2015 the Walker legislation to put a greater share of health and pension costs onto employees. But they didn&rsquo;t dispute the fact that her agreements with the unions saved about $10 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalk said she used collective bargaining to reduce Dane County employee salaries and health benefits by &quot;about $10 million.&quot; The deals create the possibility that the county will have higher payouts for pensions and vacations in future years, but that is not certain. What is known is that the deals have saved the county more than $10 million in salaries and health benefit costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Falk&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-17T16:13:00.636745", "ruling_date": "2012-01-18T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Possible recall challenger to Wisconsin Gov.
