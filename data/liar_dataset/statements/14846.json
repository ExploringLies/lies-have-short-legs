Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., misstated Trump&rsquo;s response to the controversial recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have the absurdity now of a president of the United States who basically says, on a tape that everybody in this country has seen, his pride in a sense, in assaulting women,&quot; Sanders said Dec. 10 on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em>. &quot;And he has not apologized for that and he has not offered his resignation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As anybody who closely followed this chapter of the 2016 election recalls, Trump did apologize after the tape came to light.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump&rsquo;s multiple apologies</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign initially issued a one-paragraph press release that made reference to former President Bill Clinton, before apologizing &quot;if anyone was offended.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago,&quot; the Oct. 7, 2016, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170429192721/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/statement-from-donald-j.-trump\">press release reads</a>. &quot;Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close.

I&rsquo;ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me, know these words don&rsquo;t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,&quot; Trump said, before making another reference to former president Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Trump again apologized during his Oct. 9 debate with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This was locker room talk.
