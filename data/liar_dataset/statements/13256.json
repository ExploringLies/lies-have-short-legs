For a short time last year the Democrat even headed <a href=\"https://mayday.us/\">a super PAC</a> whose goal was to end all super PACs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the National Republican Congressional Committee said that hasn&rsquo;t stopped her from accepting contributions from those who gave to Super PACs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors,&quot; the NRCC wrote in <a href=\"https://www.nrcc.org/2016/09/21/bonus-editon-zephyr-teachout-pandering-super-pac-hypocrite/\">a blog post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting big money out of politics has been a central theme of her campaign to represent the 19th Congressional District, located in New York State&rsquo;s Hudson Valley and Catskills regions, like it was when she ran for governor in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Super PACs are able to accept and spend unlimited amounts of money in elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the National Republican Congressional Committee right? Has her campaign accepted money from super PAC donors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Teachout&rsquo;s donors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee names 16 people it says donated to Teachout&rsquo;s campaign and to super PACs. We found the donors in Teachout&rsquo;s campaign finance filings.&nbsp;Altogether, the 16 donors have given $67,300 to Teachout. That&rsquo;s about 2&nbsp;percent of the $3.2&nbsp;million she has raised, according to her latest filing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 16 Teachout contributors who gave money to super PACs contributed at least $61&nbsp;million to super PACs. Two donated $10,000 or less to super PACs. In 2016, seven&nbsp;of the donors gave to super PACs. The other nine&nbsp;did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the 16 donors are&nbsp;billionaire George Soros and members of his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Super PAC support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachout has received backing from one super PAC: National Nurses United. It <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00490375/1086729/se\">reported</a> spending almost $47,000 in&nbsp;digital ad buys for the Democrat this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachout&#39;s campaign says&nbsp;Faso has received more help from super PACs. New York Wins reported spending close to $1 million in ads and mailers against his primary opponent. The group has not reported spending anything against Teachout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, spent more than $2.7 million against Teachout in mail and media placement since the June primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know I&rsquo;m running against John Faso, but we&rsquo;re really running against super PACs,&quot; Teachout said at a campaign event in August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a series of blog posts, the National Republican Congressional Committee said &quot;Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We cross-checked 16 donors to Teachout&rsquo;s campaign with their donations to super PACs. We found all of them also donated to super PACs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim as True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d71ac40c-ac62-4894-acb4-74f2affc8a90\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d71ac40c-ac62-4894-acb4-74f2affc8a90</a>\r\n\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-13T12:46:04.009975", "ruling_date": "2016-10-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Some of Teachout's donors also gave to super PACs", "ruling_headline_slug": "some-teachouts-donors-also-gave-super-pacs", "ruling_link_text": "We checked elections filings", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nrcc.org/2016/09/21/bonus-editon-zephyr-teachout-pandering-super-pac-hypocrite/\">Blog posts from the NRCC</a> on Teachout&rsquo;s campaign contributions, Aug. 24, 2016 - Sept. 21, 2016, Accessed Sept. 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Chris Pack from the National Republican Congressional Committee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone conversation with Alexis Grenell from the Zephyr Teachout campaign</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on contributions from <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/candidates.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=NY19&amp;spec=N\">the Center for Responsive Politics</a> and the Federal Elections Commission, Accessed Sept. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00603365\">Contributors to the New York Wins super PAC</a>, Center for Responsive Politics, Accessed Sept. 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on independent expenditure spending (super PACs) from ProPublica&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/independent_expenditures/2016/NY/House/19\">Election Bot</a> and <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00490375/1086729/se\">the Federal Elections Commission</a>, Accessed Sept. 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?candidateCommitteeId=C00608174&amp;tabIndex=1\">Zephyr Teachout&rsquo;s campaign committee</a>, which includes quarterly filings of itemized contributions, Accessed Sept. 27, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 121, "last_name": "National Republican Congressional Committee", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "national-republican-congressional-committee", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Logo_NRC_Elephant.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/121/", "total_count": 58, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a series of blog posts, ending on Sept. 21, 2016", "statement_date": "2016-09-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Candidate for Congress", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Zephyr", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New York", "id": 3591, "last_name": "Teachout", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "zephyr-teachout", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Teachout_Thumbnail.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3591/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.zephyrteachoutforcongress.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "We fact-checked this claim about donations to Congressional Candidate Zephyr Teachout"}
