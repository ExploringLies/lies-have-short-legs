He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well. He wants to get rid of all that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video showed Stewart driving in his car to a protest at the Red Hen, the restaurant in Lexington, Va., that sparked controversy when its owner asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to get up from her table and leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart was joined at the protest by campaign supporters, including a local &quot;Bikers for Trump&quot; group. His comments followed some Democratic calls to abolish ICE, the U.S. government agency best known for arresting, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After progressive candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep.

Noel Fritsch, spokesman for the Stewart campaign, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine has been relatively firm in his support for bills that add to border security, while at the same time advocating for legal immigration, protection of Dreamers &mdash;&nbsp;immigrants here illegally who arrived as children &mdash;&nbsp;and other traditionally Democratic immigration policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine has also been critical of Trump&rsquo;s policy of separating immigrant families at the border. With regard to ICE, Kaine has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/832675935958757376/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E832675935958757376&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fox5dc.com%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2F236518498-story\">rebuked</a> controversial raiding tactics practiced under the Trump administration, but he has not called for the agency&rsquo;s termination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tim believes we need comprehensive immigration reform and strongly supported legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 to create a path to citizenship and fund border security,&quot; said a statement on the immigration <a href=\"https://timkaine.com/issue/fighting-immigrant-communities/\">page</a> of Kaine&rsquo;s campaign website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2013 bill, for which Kaine <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tim-kaine-voices-support-for-immigration-bill-on-senate-floor-entirely-in-spanish/2013/06/11/8a146ece-d2a9-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html?utm_term=.4a6e2f2a0999\">delivered</a> a Senate floor speech in Spanish, was the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/744\">Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act</a>, and it passed the Senate by a 68-32 vote. Although it ultimately <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/26/ronald-brownstein/did-senators-pass-immigration-reform-bills-2006-20/\">died</a> in the House, the bill would have increased the number of federal agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, required construction of 700 miles of border fencing and allocated money for aerial drones, among <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-giant-symbol-in-fight-over-trumps-wall-democrats-who-once-supported-a-border-barrier-now-oppose-it/2018/01/05/b6441602-f18f-11e7-b390-a36dc3fa2842_story.html?utm_term=.23301b88bea8\">other border security measures</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill also included provisions that would have allowed immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to adjust their immigration status so long as they satisfied certain criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, in February 2018, Kaine co-sponsored a bipartisan <a href=\"https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/senators-unveil-bipartisan-amendment-to-protect-dreamers-strengthen-border-security\">bill</a> to protect Dreamers and enhance border security. In addition to providing legal status and a path to citizenship for people who arrived in the U.S. as children, the bill would have granted $25 billion in funding for Northern and Southern border security over a 10-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve reached a deal that gives us the best chance to protect Dreamers against deportation from the only country they know as home,&quot; Kaine <a href=\"https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/senators-unveil-bipartisan-amendment-to-protect-dreamers-strengthen-border-security\">said</a> at the time. Ultimately, the proposal fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate after the Trump administration publicly opposed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we do need to do more border control,&quot; Kaine said during an <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/04/10/peggy_noonan_to_tim_kaine_why_cant_the_us_control_its_borders.html\">interview</a> on MSNBC&rsquo;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; in April 2018. &quot;I want to see a strategy &hellip; not just a president acting like the military was his palace guard and he could do whatever he wanted on a day in question.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to the 2013 and 2018 bills as well as an <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.usatoday.com_story_opinion_2018_06_20_donald-2Dtrump-2Dassault-2Dimmigrant-2Dchildren-2Dshows-2Damericans-2Dharsh-2Dreality-2Dcolumn_715964002_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=Yg_qrQW8IcJ8HtI-toNw-WVZ3ju2ZsNQ0c1ljSgvjWc&amp;m=JXUDWPT4_uraYU81oQyn-QZDxYdftBtxvs8RJXlf9GE&amp;s=Bltt4jXkVFuYOK6Qdr-U2tgDeClFaZvdDXa6f-zFXdI&amp;e=\">op-ed</a> Kaine wrote criticizing the Trump policy of separating families at the border.
