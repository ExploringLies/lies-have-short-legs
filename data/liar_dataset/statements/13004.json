Supporters of Prop 60 say the initiative would strengthen the existing law, which they say is rarely enforced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has long pushed for greater safety standards in adult films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, voters in Los Angeles County <a href=\"http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Measure-B-Porn-Condoms-Los-Angeles-LA-Election-Results-Decision-2012-177573761.html\">approved a similar condom requirement</a> for adult films made in that county. It is considered a model for Prop 60, which applies its condom mandate to scenes with anal and vaginal intercourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prop 60 would also require adult film companies to obtain a health license and pay for the costs of vaccinations and health tests for sexually transmitted diseases for their performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the No on 60 campaign for evidence backing up its claim that performers would be open to lawsuits under the measure. A spokesman pointed to the initiative&rsquo;s section 6720.6, on enforcement, whistleblowers and private rights of action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It allows those who witness violations of the proposed law -- including performers, prosecutors or anyone who is a California resident -- to file a complaint with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. If the agency declines to pursue the case within 21 days, the witness could then file a civil lawsuit against anyone with a financial interest in the film, which could include some performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no mention in the No on 60 advertisement, however, that only performers with a financial interest would be liable.&nbsp;Nor does the ad mention the complaint process that must precede a lawsuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/7396783/Condoms083116P.jpg\" style=\"height:600px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Robert Elyov / Flickr</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More porn&nbsp;workers with financial stake</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, opponents of the measure say making performers liable is significant because many have a financial stake in the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You see, in today&rsquo;s adult film industry, the majority of performers are also producers,&quot; Eric Paul Leue, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition, wrote in an <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/8/17/suing-porn-stars-will-not-lead-less-hiv\">opinion piece</a> about Prop 60 in the Advocate, a LGBT news publication, this month. &quot;In addition to shooting for studios, most porn stars regularly create their own content -- either for their own websites, on webcams, or in partnership with studios.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prop 60 would apply to any commercial pornography produced in California, in traditional films and on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrChauntelle\">Dr. Chauntelle Tibbals</a>, a sociologist who studies the adult film industry, said the percentage of workers who have a financial stake in adult content they contribute to &quot;is certainly very high,&quot; though she said there&rsquo;s no accepted estimate. Advances in technology and distribution, she said, have allowed more workers to share in the financial success of their content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Everyone from webcam models to agents may have a financial stake in a single piece of content,&quot; Tibbals added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters of Prop 60, however, maintain the claim about workers being exposed to lawsuits is deceptive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only people who can get sued (under Prop 60) are producers,&quot; said Rick Taylor, who manages the Yes on 60 campaign. &quot;Some actors and actresses are producers. If they&rsquo;re breaking the law, they&rsquo;re going to potentially get sued.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taylor said the measure&rsquo;s goal is to bolster worker protections and public health, and that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what percentage of performers have a financial stake in the films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opponents of California&rsquo;s Prop 60, which would require condom use in adult films, recently claimed it would put &quot;workers in the adult film industry at risk for lawsuits and harassment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate: Some adult film workers, and perhaps a growing share, could face lawsuits if they have a financial interest in the content they work on. But Prop 60 does not specify what constitutes a financial interest. Ultimately, it may be up to the courts to decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, the claim by the opponents makes no mention that only workers with a monetary stake in the films would be liable and only after a complaint process plays out. Those who are independent contractors would face no legal action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement leaves out this key context and gives the impression that any or all workers could face lawsuits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>HALF TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/be4f6e60-46d0-4490-af32-884f48bf9a49\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/be4f6e60-46d0-4490-af32-884f48bf9a49</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-01T20:20:44.002600", "ruling_date": "2016-09-02T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Will California\u2019s Prop 60 expose adult film workers to lawsuits?
