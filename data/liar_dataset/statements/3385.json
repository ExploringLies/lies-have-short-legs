Rick Scott asked Florida legislators to pass his proposed budget during his first State of the State speech on March 8, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s a budget that cuts spending to balance the budget as required by the state Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>And,&nbsp;</em> it cuts taxes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I delivered to you a budget that ... cuts taxes by $2 billion,&quot; Scott told legislators on the first day of its 60-day legislative session.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet&#39;s walk through the math of his budget. Scott proposed a two-year budget that cuts a host of taxes and fees. <a href=\"http://letsgettowork.state.fl.us/Highlights/Step6/..%5C..%5Cimages%5CGraphs%5C2011-Major-Tax-Reforms.pdf\">Here&#39;s a breakdown from the governor&#39;s office</a>. Scott&#39;s budget proposal would:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; <a href=\"http://letsgettowork.state.fl.us/Highlights/Step7/..%5C..%5Cimages%5Cgraphs%5C2011-Eliminate-Florida-Corporate-Income-Tax.pdf\" id=\"xl93\" title=\"Reduce the corporate income tax\">Reduce the corporate income tax</a> from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2011-12 and from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012-13. The rate cut will save those who pay the tax $459 million this year and a little more than $1 billion in 2012-13;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; <a href=\"http://letsgettowork.state.fl.us/Highlights/Step6/Step6ReducePropertyTax.aspx\" id=\"uwm1\" title=\"Reduce the required local effort\">Reduce the required local effort</a>, a property tax to fund schools, saving taxpayers around $600 million in 2011-12. The tax cut would carry forward in 2012-13;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; <a href=\"http://letsgettowork.state.fl.us/Highlights/Step6/Step6ReducePropertyTax.aspx\" id=\"mf0j\" title=\"Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts\">Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts</a> 25 percent for two years, saving taxpayers $180 million annually;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Reduce unemployment compensation taxes by shortening how long Floridians can collect benefits and making it more difficult for them to be eligible. Scott&#39;s office says that will save $630.8 million over two years;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Roll back 2009 Legislature-approved fee increases for driver licenses, vehicle registrations and other motor vehicle fees. Scott says the rollback would save drivers $492 million over two years;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; And repeal or alter other small taxes on ammonia, pesticides, fertilizer, solvents, dry cleaning, tires and lead acid batteries, among other things. The changes would save $77 million over two years, Scott&#39;s office says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTaken together, that is a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 -- slightly below the figure he claimed in his speech. (Scott&#39;s office, by the way, claims a total of $4.1 billion over two years, but that number is deceiving <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/613/reduce-property-tax-required-local-effort-by-1-m/\">because most cuts in the second year of Scott&#39;s budget aren&#39;t <i>additional </i>cuts</a>; they are just the same cuts rolled over.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tScott said his budget cuts taxes by $2 billion. But really, the number is about 15 percent high, based on the estimates of his own budget office.
