href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/video-campaign-ad-vote-no-on-lizbeth-benacquisto-998708.html\">In stark, black-and-white montages of tear-streaked female faces</a>, District 27 state senate hopeful Kevin Rader blasts his Republican opponent in a campaign ad for her anti-abortion views.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRader, a Democrat and state House member, accuses Republican Lizbeth Benacquisto of strongly opposing abortion and&nbsp;having ties to extremist conservative groups that would criminally prosecute rape victims for having abortions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Lizbeth Benacquisto strongly opposes a woman&#39;s right of choice,&quot; the ad states. &quot;The extremist groups who support her would make these women into criminals. She supported an extreme law to require pregnant women to pay for&nbsp; and view a sonogram before they could exercise their right of choice. Her allies would make choice illegal in all cases, including rape, incest, even to save a woman&#39;s life. Vote no on Benacquisto, keep extremism out of our state Senate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad enraged Benacquisto, a city councilwoman in Wellington, who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tODVWh6i_MM\">responded with her own ad </a>and the&nbsp;revelation that she was raped 23 years ago as a University of Florida freshman. She underscored her support for an exception to abortion for rape victims, saying she would &quot;never stand down when any woman has been abused,&quot; and demanded Rader pull the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRader&#39;s camp said the only way that will happen is if Benacquisto renounces the support given to her by far-right, conservative right-to-life groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWith such a high emotion level in this campaign, we thought Rader&#39;s claim about Benacquisto&#39;s supporters was worth a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBenacquisto is pro-life, and she makes no secret of it&nbsp;on her website and in questionnaires.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSame with her support of the ultrasound legislation, though she has noted in various interviews she has concerns about its impact on rape victims. <a href=\"http://www.flacathconf.org/CQP2010/Responses/Benaquisto_Lizbeth.html\">In a candidate questionnaire from the Christian Coalition of Florida</a>, she added, &quot;I consistently support this because I am pro-life.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBenacquisto holds support from a handful of conservative, anti-abortion groups. Among those are the Christian Coalition, the Florida Right to Life PAC and the Christian Family Coalition. Though they haven&#39;t donated financially, both <a href=\"http://www.votelizbeth.com/news.php?id=11\">Florida Right to Life </a>and <a href=\"http://www.votelizbeth.com/news.php?id=10\">the former Christian Coalition executive director have offered endorsements</a>, and she headlined at least one event,<a href=\"http://cfcoalition.com/full_article.php?article_no=172\"> a breakfast for the Christian Family Coalition </a>on Oct. 16.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://frtl.homestead.com/\">Florida Right to Life believes </a>life begins at conception and ends at natural death, and all points in between are to be defended. It labels abortion &quot;infanticide,&quot; which is a crime. And the <a href=\"http://www.ccfla.org/protectinglife.php\">Christian Coalition of Florida states</a>, &quot;Although legal in the United States, we believe abortion is no less than murder of an innocent human life.&quot; Using this logic, abortion equals murder and murder is a crime. Therefore, those who have abortions would be criminals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.cfcoalition.com/about_us.php\">Christian Family Coalition</a>, based in Miami, says it &quot;works to introduce pro-family legislation at the state and local levels of government. It informs and educates citizens on where candidates stand on the issues that affect the traditional family unit.&quot; The group&rsquo;s website includes a link to &quot;abortion,&quot; but contains just news articles and press releases in which it is mentioned.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEach of those three organizations also closely follows abortion-related legislation. They post opinions on everything from parental notice to making the violent death of any fetus&nbsp;-- viable or otherwise&nbsp;-- cause for a first-degree murder charge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut none appear to flat-out say they would support abortion regardless of whether a woman was raped, abused by a family member or faced with death. They skirt the issue. For example, <a href=\"http://frtl.homestead.com/\">Florida Right to Life says</a>, &quot;We promote, uphold and support reverence and respect for human life without regard to condition, quality, age, race, religion, color or whether born or unborn.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the National Right to Life page, the only reference to exceptions is a 2005 survey indicating only 0.5 percent of women have abortions due to rape, while 4 percent undergo it for the mother&#39;s health.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRader&#39;s campaign manager, Michael McCall, said, &quot;The problem with something like that is if you take an organization like Florida Right to Life, their very core is making abortion illegal. They won&#39;t list every case in which they support banning abortions, because they support banning abortions in all cases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s clear that groups supporting Benacquisto have firm stands against abortion, but they&#39;re not spelled out precisely. What is clear, though, is that the groups don&#39;t offer up any exceptions. So we don&#39;t expect&nbsp;Rader&#39;s campaign to find any.&nbsp; We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-29T14:24:29.549785", "ruling_date": "2010-10-29T19:08:41", "ruling_headline": "Kevin Rader says \"extremist\" supporters of his opponent would make abortion illegal in all cases", "ruling_headline_slug": "kevin-rader-says-extremist-groups-support-opponent", "ruling_link_text": "Right to life groups that support her have no mention of exceptions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tKevin Rader <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/video-campaign-ad-vote-no-on-lizbeth-benacquisto-998708.html\">campaign ad</a>, Oct. 27, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.flacathconf.org/CQP2010/Responses/Benaquisto_Lizbeth.html\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.10812721281661314\">Florida Catholic Conference 2010 Candidate Questionnaire Project</a>, Lizbeth Benacquisto:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;<a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/saying-she-was-raped-state-senate-candidate-benacquisto-1000726.html\">Saying She Was Raped, State Senate Candidate Benacquisto Says Rival Rader&rsquo;s Attacks Crossed the Line</a>,&quot;
