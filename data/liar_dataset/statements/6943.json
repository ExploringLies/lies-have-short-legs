Then he confronted Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Romney: </strong>&quot;Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Obama: </strong>&quot;You know, I don&rsquo;t look at my pension. It&rsquo;s not as big as yours so it doesn&rsquo;t take as long. I don&rsquo;t check it that often.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Romney: </strong>&quot;Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe exchange was a role reversal: An Obama campaign ad in July 2012 claimed Romney had millions in the Cayman Islands, among other &quot;tax havens.&quot; We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/17/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-stashed-money-cayman-islands/\">rated that True,</a> noting that nothing was illegal or improper about the investments through his blind trust.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also reviewed an Obama claim from an ad in September 2012 that said, &quot;Even today part of Romney&rsquo;s fortune is invested in China.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/20/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-talks-tough-china-puts-his-money/\">rated that Mostly True</a>, noting that Romney had money invested in funds that owned shares in two Chinese firms, but that Obama&rsquo;s claim suggested Romney had more to do with the investment decision than is the case. (We further noted that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/world/asia/bain-capital-tied-to-surveillance-push-in-china.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\"><em>New York Times </em>reported</a> that one of the funds had invested in a Chinese video surveillance company that supplies cameras to police for watching public spaces.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOkay, so what about Romney&rsquo;s debate description of Obama&rsquo;s pension investments?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign told us it was referring to investments made by the Illinois State Board of Investment on behalf of the state employees&rsquo; retirement system there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama, you may recall, was an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 before winning election to the U.S. Senate. He is a participant in the General Assembly Retirement System in Illinois, said William Atwood, executive director of the Board of Investment, who confirmed that for us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign pointed us to that pension fund&rsquo;s holding in an entity that is part of Advent International. Advent has <a href=\"http://www.adventinternational.com/news/pressreleases/pages/pressRelease_20080407.aspx\">described itself</a> as &quot;one of the world&rsquo;s most global private equity firms&quot; and has buyout offices in 16 countries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtwood confirmed that the pension fund has invested $30 million in one of Advent&rsquo;s limited partnerships, Advent International GPE VI-A. That partnership was organized in the Cayman Islands, Atwood said. <a href=\"http://idc.api.edgar-online.com/efx_dll/edgarpro.dll?FetchFilingConvPDF1?SessionID=Tww8FtZxDXw0SIS&amp;ID=8739052\">Public filings</a> back that up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about Romney&rsquo;s broader claims, about Obama&rsquo;s foreign investments?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Illinois pension fund also has numerous foreign investments, including in Chinese companies, as part of its diversified portfolio, Atwood said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/17/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-stashed-money-cayman-islands/\">has connected </a>Romney&rsquo;s overseas investments in the Caymans to methods for avoiding U.S. taxes. But there&rsquo;s no evidence Obama receives any tax advantage from his overseas pension investments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP in New York, reviewed public filings by Advent and said it was highly unlikely Obama got any tax advantage from the pension fund&rsquo;s investment in the Advent partnership.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtwood went further, saying: &quot;There is no tax advantage to any (pension) plan participant&quot; from that investment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiller offered this analysis: &quot;There is no evidence that the fund helped the Illinois pension fund avoid any taxes &ndash; in this respect, the Illinois pension fund would have been treated identically had the fund been organized as a domestic (U.S.) partnership. However, the fact that it was organized as a Cayman partnership might have allowed some taxable investors to defer some tax on foreign (non-U.S.) portfolio companies purchased by the Fund.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtwood emphasized that neither Obama nor any other participant in the retirement system has anything to do with selecting investments for the fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiller concurred with that, and added that Romney legitimately can claim that he has similar distance from foreign investments made through his individual retirement accounts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s &quot;entirely accurate&quot; for Romney to say that Obama&rsquo;s pension plan has investments in foreign companies and through a Caymans trust, Miller said. Technically, it&rsquo;s a Cayman-based partnership, but that&rsquo;s a trivial difference, he added.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our rating<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t</strong>Romney told Obama: &quot;You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s an accurate set of statements when you consider investments made by managers of the Illinois pension fund in which Obama has an account.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we noted in reviewing previous claims about Romney&rsquo;s investments in China, the investments involved are indirect and -- as far as anybody has said -- made without the knowledge of the account holder.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith that clarification, we rate Romney&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-17T17:25:21.108500", "ruling_date": "2012-10-17T17:50:03", "ruling_headline": "Romney says Obama also has investments in Chinese companies and through a Cayman Islands trust", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-says-obama-also-has-investments-chinese-com", "ruling_link_text": "Didn\u2019t make them, but his pension fund did", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/16/full-transcript-of-the-second-presidential-debate/\">debate transcript</a>, Romney-Obama exchange on personal investments, Oct. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with William Atwood, executive direcctor, Illinois State Board of Investment, Oct. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with David S.
