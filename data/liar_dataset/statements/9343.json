Russia did not like the idea one bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov told the Russian news organization <a href=\"http://en.ria.ru/russia/20061222/57581260.html\"><u>Ria Novosti</u></a> that Russia was opposed and that the plans did not make &quot;political sense, much less military sense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2008 election, candidate Obama said he supported the installations in Poland and the Czech Republic but also said he was open to rethinking them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Obama took office in 2009, he spoke of making U.S. relations with Russia less confrontational. The symbol of this was a photo-op of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presenting her Russian counterpart with a &nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/03/17/the-failure-of-the-u-s-russia-reset-in-9-photos/\"><u>reset&quot;</u></a> button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years after Bush announced his missile defense proposal, Obama changed course. On Sept. 17, 2009, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-Strengthening-Missile-Defense-in-Europe/\"><u>Obama</u></a> announced that the United States would pursue a new missile defense policy focused on knocking out short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. The new plan relied on missiles based on American warships and eventually sites closer to Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The response at home and overseas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, released statements suggesting that Obama was being soft and letting down American allies. Pundits like John Bolton, whom Bush had appointed as ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia and Iran came away as &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32889934/ns/politics-white_house/t/obama-scraps-bush-era-europe-missile-shield/#.Uy8SPa1dWGM\"><u>big winners</u></a>&quot; in a &quot;bad day for American national security.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Israel and most NATO countries in Western Europe approved of the move, news stories show, because they thought the missile system provoked Russia. Polish and Czech leaders <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32889934/ns/politics-white_house/t/obama-scraps-bush-era-europe-missile-shield/#.U3orGPldU3B\"><u>expressed disappointment</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama left it to Defense Secretary Robert Gates to explain the shift. In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/opinion/20gates.html?em\"><u>New York Times</u><u> op-ed</u></a>, and later in his 2014 book <em>Duty</em>, Gates said that Defense Department officials realized the Iranian government was putting more stock into building short- and medium-range missiles over long-range ones. The agency wanted to uproot the old plan to better counteract that threat, and the new tactic Gates and the<strong> </strong>Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Obama was cheaper and took less time to implement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lance Janda, chairman of the Department of History and Government at Cameron University, added that the full U.S. strategy included <a href=\"http://www.mda.mil/system/aegis_ashore.html\"><u>deploying potentially hundreds of interceptor missiles</u></a> in Eastern Europe starting in 2018. Lost in the GOP fury, Gates wrote, was that the Russians found Obama&rsquo;s new approach to be even more worrisome than the Bush-era plan. &nbsp;They worried that those missiles could easily be configured to thwart them as well as Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheney said Obama dropped a missile defense plan based in Poland and the Czech Republic on the &quot;mere request&quot; of Putin. While Putin strenuously objected to the plan, a Pentagon reassessment of the nature of Iran&rsquo;s capabilities was the actual reason for the change. The Pentagon saw a greater danger from Iranian short-and-medium-range missiles than the long range missiles that were targeted in the original plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NATO allies and Israel also favored the new approach, which included steps to install a missile defense system in Poland in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Obama did forgo the Bush-era plan, but he didn&rsquo;t do it at the &quot;mere request&quot; of Putin. We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-19T15:47:07.830621", "ruling_date": "2014-05-19T16:38:56", "ruling_headline": "Cheney: At \"mere request of Putin,\" Obama ditched Eastern Europe missile defense plan", "ruling_headline_slug": "cheney-mere-request-putin-obama-ditched-eastern-eu", "ruling_link_text": "The Pentagon wanted the change", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2014/05/18/dick-and-lynne-cheney-talk-ukraine-benghazi-and-hillary\"><u>Fox News Sunday</u></a>, May 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/23/mitt-romney/romney-obama-stopped-missile-defense-shield-gift-r/\"><u>Romney: Obama stopped missile defense shield &#39;as a gift to Russia&#39;</u></a>, March 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Lance Janda, Cameron University Department of History and Government chairman, March 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/23/dick-cheney/cheney-accuses-obama-telling-allies-canceled-proje/\">Cheney accuses Obama of telling allies about cancelled projects in &lsquo;midnight&rsquo; calls&nbsp;</a>,&quot; Oct. 23, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/22/barack-obama/did-obama-flip-whether-he-would-continue-pursue-mi/\">Did Obama flip on whether he would continue to pursue a missile shield in Poland?</a>&quot; Sept. 22, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ria Novosti, <a href=\"http://en.ria.ru/russia/20061222/57581260.html\"><u>Russia against U.S. missile defense plans for Europe</u></a>, Dec. 22, 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/opinion/20gates.html?em\">Op-Ed: A Better Missile Defense for a Safer Europe&nbsp;</a>, by Robert M.
