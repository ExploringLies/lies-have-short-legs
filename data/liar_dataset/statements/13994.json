Do they really prefer root canals, traffic jams and colonoscopies over this branch of government? <em>Really</em>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s Arnold Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s colorful claim from a February 2017 video that went viral. He repeated the allegations in an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/arnold-schwarzenegger/lets-make-washington-work-for-us/10155089398841760/\">April 12, 2017 post on Facebook</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the video, he&nbsp;points out the deep disdain for Congress but also notes that nearly all members are re-elected due to what Schwarzenegger calls a rigged political redistricting system, or gerrymandering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s his claim in its raw form:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn&rsquo;t beat herpes in the polls.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qfc3N0ZngXs\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former California governor and movie star has vowed to raise awareness about gerrymandering now that&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://ktla.com/2017/03/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-wont-return-to-the-new-celebrity-apprentice-says-show-has-baggage/\">he&rsquo;s finished</a> as host of <em>The New Celebrity Apprentice</em> and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-schwarzenegger-says-he-s-not-running-1489327263-htmlstory.html\">squashed rumors</a> he might run for U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we know approval ratings for Congress are low, we wondered if they&rsquo;re really as pathetic as Schwarzenegger wants us to believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve checked Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s claims on Congress and gerrymandering. In February, we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/mar/17/arnold-schwarzenegger/true-nothing-inflated-schwarzneggers-claim-average/\">rated as True</a> his assertion that, <em>&quot;The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%.&quot;</em> He was referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s spokesman for evidence backing up his claim about Congress&rsquo; pitiful popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed to results from surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling in <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-less-popular-than-cockroaches-traffic-jams.html\">January 2013</a> and <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2013/PPP_Release_CONGRESS_108.pdf\">October 2013</a>. The polling company is known for conducting some <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/05/americans-so-over-hipsters.html\">tongue-in-cheek surveys</a> and works with liberal clients. In the polls on Congress&rsquo; popularity, it asked hundreds of&nbsp;registered voters if they have a higher opinion of either Congress or a series of unpleasant or disliked things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we tackle those results, let&rsquo;s look at Congress&rsquo; overall approval ratings in these recent PPP polls:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- January 2013: Congress&rsquo;s overall favorability rating among voters was just 9 percent favorable and 85 percent unfavorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- October 2013: Congress&rsquo; overall favorability rating dipped slightly to 8 &nbsp;percent favorable with the same 85 percent unfavorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- March 2017: Congress&rsquo; overall favorability rating nudged up to 11 percent with only 68 percent of voters disapproving of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s tackle those head-to-head results:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- 53 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of hemorrhoids than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent in this matchup, according to the October 2013 survey</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nickelback</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- 39 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of the rock band Nickelback than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Traffic jams</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of traffic jams, than Congress, which was favored by only 34 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Root canals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this dental procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Colonoscopies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- 58 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this invasive procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Herpes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PPP surveys didn&rsquo;t ask about herpes. It did ask, however, about gonorrhea. And Congress was still less popular than that venereal disease. A spokesman for the company that produced Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s video pointed to a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/21/opinion/obeidallah-congress-failure/\">2011 CNN op-ed</a> where comedian and radio show host Dean Obeidallah claimed Congress was less popular than herpes, without citing evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed: &quot;Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn&rsquo;t beat herpes in the polls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surveys by the Public Policy Polling mostly back-up Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s dramatic claim. It should be noted, however, that the polls were conducted about four years ago and don&rsquo;t include a comparison of Congress to herpes. Congress&rsquo; overall approval rating has remained in the dumps since that time, rising only slightly from 8 percent to 11 percent. It&rsquo;s disapproval rating has, however, shrunk somewhat from 85 percent to 68 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong></em>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-14T12:58:00.644843", "ruling_date": "2017-04-14T11:06:11", "ruling_headline": "Is Congress really less popular than hemorrhoids and herpes as Arnold Schwarzenegger claims?", "ruling_headline_slug": "congress-really-less-popular-hemorrhoids-and-herpe", "ruling_link_text": "Poll finds pathetic approval ratings for Congress", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, <a href=\"http://www.attn.com/videos/14934/arnold-schwarzenegger-just-revealed-reason-congress-worse-herpes\">video</a>, Feb. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Mike Vainisi, spokesman for attn.com, April 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Daniel Ketchell, spokesma<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/mar/17/arnold-schwarzenegger/true-nothing-inflated-schwarzneggers-claim-average/\">n for Arnold Schwarzenegger, April 7, 2017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact California,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/mar/17/arnold-schwarzenegger/true-nothing-inflated-schwarzneggers-claim-average/\"> Nothing inflated in Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s claim on gerrymandering</a>, March 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-less-popular-than-cockroaches-traffic-jams.html\">Congress less popular than cockroaches, traffic jams</a>, Jan. 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2013/PPP_Release_CONGRESS_108.pdf\">Americans like Witches, the IRS, and even Hemorrhoids better than Congress</a>, Oct. 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2017/PPP_Release_National_33017.pdf\">Trump, Ryan Both Hit Record Low Approval</a>, March 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN.com, op-ed, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/21/opinion/obeidallah-congress-failure/\">Can we lock Congress out?</a>, Nov. 21, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "actor", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Arnold", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "California", "id": 3360, "last_name": "Schwarzenegger", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "arnold-schwarzenegger", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Arnold_new_mug_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3360/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes.
