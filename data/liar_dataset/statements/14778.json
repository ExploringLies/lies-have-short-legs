The report calculates the averages of two types of infant care, care offered at a facility and care offered at someone&rsquo;s home.The $7,644 used by the EPI is&nbsp;the more expensive type of infant care, care offered at a facility. According to the report, the average cost of childcare provided in a caregiver&rsquo;s home in Georgia is $5,980 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to EPI, Georgia&#39;s average in-state tuition estimate was taken from a 2014 survey conducted by the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_330.20.asp\">National Center of Education Statistics</a>, a division of the U.S. Education Department. The total cost of tuition and required fees in a public university in Georgia averages out to $6,614 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Abrams&#39; number is accurate if the comparison is between child care at a facility and in-state college tuition. But it&rsquo;s not correct if the comparison is with child care provided in a home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abrams is not the first, and possibly not the last politician to make this type of comparison. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-31-states-decent-child-care-cost/\">Back in 2014</a>, PolitiFact checked President Barack Obama&#39;s claim that in 31 states &quot;decent&quot; childcare cost more than college tuition. Back then, Obama also used Child Care Aware of America as a source. We rated his claim as Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Abrams tweeted, &quot;The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr &ndash; more than average in-state college tuition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abrams is correct if the comparison is between child care at a facility and college tuition, at $7,644 vs. $6,614. But child care offered in someone&rsquo;s home -- at $5,980 -- is less that in-state college tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important facts.
