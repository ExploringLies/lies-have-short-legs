She started with CBO&rsquo;s baseline projections, which assumes that current spending laws will play out as enacted. Then she added a few assumptions of her own, according to Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for here campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke, unlike the CBO baseline, posited that the Bush tax cuts will be extended at the end of this year and that the Alternative Minimum Tax will be indexed for inflation, as Congress has done in the past. Those two assumptions result in about $1.4 trillion more in debt over four years, the CBO estimates say.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe took Radtke&rsquo;s 2 percent idea and assumptions, and we applied them to the CBO&rsquo;s latest baseline projections, published in March.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the federal government is expected to spend $3.64 trillion and collect revenues of $2.46 trillion. Under Radtke&rsquo;s proposal, the government would freeze spending at the $3.64 trillion mark and then cut 2 percent each year. The red ink would disappear during fiscal 2016, when spending would be pared to $3.36 trillion and revenues would come in at $3.47 trillion. That means there would be a $110 billion surplus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Radtke is mathematically correct in saying annual 2 spending cuts would balance the budget in 2016. We should point out it would take four years to end deficits, not the five years the candidate claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is her proposal realistic?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn practice, the policy would require far more sacrifice than Radtke suggests. Her presentations ignore a key point: The cost of federal entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- will increase over the next four years and longer as Baby Boomers retire and collect benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo during the same four years that the Radtke proposal would push down spending with compounded 2 percent annual cuts, the CBO projects the cost of the federal government&rsquo;s current policies will rise by about 3 percent a year -- almost entirely to support mandatory adjustments to entitlement programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2016, Radtke&rsquo;s plan would cut $282 billion from the current spending level, requiring Congress to bring the budget down to $3.36 trillion. But the CBO estimates the costs of current policies will increase by about $460 billion in 2016, bringing the baseline budget up to $4.1 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo in 2016, there would be about a $742 billion gap between Radtke&rsquo;s proposal and the CBO baseline budget. That means for Radtke&rsquo;s plan to work, Congress in 2016 would have to cut about $742 billion from existing programs. The excision would almost match the entire $786 billion defense budget this year and exceed the $708 billion expected to be spent on Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke&rsquo;s proposal would slice almost twice as deep as the <a href=\"http://documents.latimes.com/rep-paul-ryans-path-prosperity-2013/\">House Republican budget plan</a>, which in 2016 calls for a $410 billion cut to current services, including a major overhaul of Medicare. The GOP budget calls for the U.S. to keep running deficits until 2040.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that advocates a mix of cutting spending and increasing revenues to balance the budget, was dismissive of Radtke&rsquo;s proposal. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Surely it seems reasonable in the face -- cut 2 percent and you&rsquo;ll get there,&quot; he said. &quot;But what do you cut? The real question is your intestinal fortitude to do that. There are mandatory spending programs -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid -- and then, even in discretionary spending, the big enchilada there is defense, and you don&rsquo;t go too far in Virginia talking about defense cuts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoberton Williams, senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center, pointed out that Radtke&rsquo;s plan in 2016 would limit spending to about 80 percent of the amount the CBO says would be needed to support current programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The issue is not whether her numbers are accurate but whether they would mean much larger spending cuts than the rhetoric suggests,&quot; he said via email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke does not prescribe a formula for achieving the 2 percent cuts, according to Hansen, her campaign spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That said, she has said that Social Security and other entitlements are not sustainable for seniors or younger people in their current form,&quot; he said. &quot;She has proposals reforming Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements so we can provide better services with less money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke, on her website, calls for a number of spending cuts: <a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/issues/entitlement-programs/\">repealing President Barack Obama&rsquo;s health care act</a>; eliminating Medicare fraud; allowing health savings accounts in Medicare; moving Medicaid to a block grant program; permitting younger people to invest Social Security contributions; <a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/issues/foreign-aid/\">cutting foreign aid</a> and <a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/issues/energy-and-the-environment/\">eliminating federal subsidies</a> for products such as ethanol.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke told us she does not know how much her specific policy proposals would save and offered no assurance they would cover the cost of her deficit-reduction proposal. She said her point is not to offer an exact list of cuts for her 2 percent idea, but simply to show the math works.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I wanted to show people that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a shock to the system,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a very reasonable approach -- it can give us the process and infrastructure because we can&rsquo;t continue with business as usual.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRadtke says the U.S. budget could be balanced by 2016 if Congress froze the current spending level and then cut it by 2 percent in each of the next four years. As a cold equation, the math works out.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Radtke sugarcoats her tough proposal by comparing it to cutting a child&rsquo;s allowance by pennies. Her program of 2 percent cuts does not account for the mandated increases in entitlement programs. While she says she would be cutting about $282 billion over four years, Congress would really need to cut $742 billion from programs as they now exist.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHer program would actually require cuts in current programs going far deeper than anything proposed by even House Republican budget writers in their war against spending. That makes Radtke&rsquo;s plan highly unrealistic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRadtke&rsquo;s calculation doesn&#39;t give a full result. For that reason, we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-10T15:21:44.672917", "ruling_date": "2012-05-10T15:12:34", "ruling_headline": "Jamie Radtke says 2 percent annual cuts would balance budget in 2016", "ruling_headline_slug": "jamie-radtke-says-2-percent-annual-cuts-would-bala", "ruling_link_text": "Doesn't factor growth of entitlements", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRadtke for Senate, &quot;<a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/2012/04/my-two-cents-can-save-economy/\">My Two Cents can save economy</a>,&quot; April 5, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/08-24-BudgetEconUpdate.pdf\">The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update</a>,&quot; August 24, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/congress/joint_congressional_committee_on_deficit_reduction/index.html\">Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (Deficit &lsquo;Super Committee&rsquo;)</a>,&quot; accessed April 12, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43119\">Updated Budget Projections: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022</a>, March 13, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42905\">The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022</a>, January 31, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals/\">Historical Tables</a>, Office of Management and Budget, accessed April 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/issues/entitlement-programs/\">Entitlement Programs</a>, Radtke for Senate, accessed April 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/issues/foreign-aid/\">Foreign Aid</a>, Radtke for Senate, accessed April 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/issues/energy-and-the-environment/\">Energy</a>, Radtke for Senate, accessed April 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/issues/national-debt-and-deficits/\">National Debt and Deficits</a>, Radtke for Senate, accessed April 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails and interview with Chuck Hansen, Radtke spokesman, April 11 and 13, and May 8, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Jamie Radtke, April 17, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and emails with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, April 12, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from Roberton Williams, senior fellow for the Tax Policy Center, April 17, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRep.
