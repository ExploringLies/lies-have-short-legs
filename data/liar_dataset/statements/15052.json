We found no evidence that Cruz was immersed in Islamic or left-wing hate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of Geller&rsquo;s story has nothing to do with political views held by Cruz. It largely repeats an initial story by Fox News the day of the shooting and showed some of Cruz&rsquo;s alleged Instagram posts, identified by other teenagers as his, which included images of guns and knives as well as an image of a bullseye target with bullet holes that included the phrase &quot;Group Therapy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geller included an image from what was believed to be Cruz&rsquo;s Instagram account showing a Google search for the Arabic phrase &quot;Allahu Akbar.&quot; The<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/opinions/allahu-akbar-meaning/index.html\"> phrase</a>, which means &quot;God is greater,&quot; is used by Muslims on many occasions and in prayers but has also at times been uttered by people commiting attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz&rsquo;s Instagram account has since been shut down; however, multiple media reports stated that Cruz appeared to make fun of Islam when he wrote that &quot;at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says &lsquo;allahu Akbar.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sent Geller a summary of our findings and asked if she had evidence to support her claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He mocked the phrase, but then he turned to violence himself. This indicates that underneath his mockery, he had an affinity with those who scream this phrase while murdering people,&quot; she told PunditFact in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geller said that Cruz&rsquo;s interest in the phrase &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; &quot;doesn&#39;t mean he was an Islamic jihadi, but his mockery of it may have been an attempt to deflect attention from his aspirations, or maybe even to try to convince himself not to take the path he ultimately chose. Ultimately, we cannot know for sure what was in his mind, or what was left of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law enforcement are investigating motives and his social media posts. The portrait that has emerged of Cruz so far is not of a person motivated by political views, but one of a young man who was drawn to firearms and had a troubled past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz had <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-school-shooting-nikolas-cruz-discipline-file-20180217-story.html\">regularly gotten in trouble at school</a> at least since middle school and had transferred out of Stoneman Douglas in 2017 and had since attended alternative schools. He had a history of <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article200692514.html\">mental illness</a>, and police had been called to his home. Cruz&rsquo;s mother died in November; his father died when he was a young child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocean Parodie, 17, told The <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/nick-cruz-parkland-florida-shooting-stoneman-douglas-high-school\">Daily Beast</a> that Cruz wore patriotic shirts that &quot;seemed really extreme, like hating on&quot; Islam and would also deride Muslims as &quot;terrorists and bombers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general teenagers who knew Cruz used words such as &quot;off,&quot; &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot; to describe him to journalists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some initial news reports stated that Cruz was affiliated with a white nationalist group in Florida, but <a href=\"http://time.com/5160819/parkland-shooter-nikolas-cruz-white-supremacist-group/\">law enforcement </a>said they didn&rsquo;t have information to support that connection. A white nationalist appeared to have<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-white-nationalists-415672\"> spread misinformation to media outlets</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed spokespersons for Instagram, the FBI and the Broward Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to ask some questions about Cruz&rsquo;s Instagram account but not did get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel did not offer any involvement in Islamic or hate groups to explain why Cruz walked into the school with an assault weapon in a Feb. 18 interview with <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/this-week-in-south-florida/student-officials-call-for-change-after-parkland-shooting\">Local 10 ABC&rsquo;s Michael Putney</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked why Cruz shot up the school Israel said: &quot;Because he is an evil killer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Geller Report described Cruz as being &quot;immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate.&quot; Law enforcement are investigating motives, but so far Cruz appeared to be a person who had mental illness and a fascination with guns. A mocking Instagram post attributed to him showed he Googled the phrase &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; but that doesn&rsquo;t prove that he was immersed in Islamic and left-wing hate. We found no evidence to support Geller&rsquo;s claim. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n'<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-19T14:00:30.253403", "ruling_date": "2018-02-19T14:42:57", "ruling_headline": "No proof that Nikolas Cruz, Parkland shooter, was motivated by Islamic or left-wing hate", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-proof-nikolas-cruz-was-motivated-islamic-or-lef", "ruling_link_text": "Shooter was long troubled", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Geller Report, <a href=\"https://gellerreport.com/2018/02/fla-schol-shooter-islamic-left.html/\">&quot;Graphic video Florida Mass Shooter&rsquo;s Instagram Account,&quot;</a> Feb. 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sun Sentinel</em>, <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-florida-school-shooting-nikolas-cruz-warning-signs-20180216-story.html\">&quot;Florida shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz showed warning signs for years,&quot;</a> Feb. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article200692514.html\">&quot;Shooter cut himself and drew a Nazi symbol on his book bag, but DCF found him to be stable,&quot; </a>Feb. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/florida-shooting.html\">&quot;Florida Shooting: Nikolas Cruz Confessed to Police That He Began Shooting Students &#39;in the Hallways,&#39;&quot;</a> Feb. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN,<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/opinions/allahu-akbar-meaning/index.html\"> &quot;What &#39;Allahu Akbar&#39; really means,&quot; </a>Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Beast,<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/nick-cruz-parkland-florida-shooting-stoneman-douglas-high-school\"> &quot;Florida School Shooting Suspect Nikolas Cruz Was &lsquo;Creepy and Weird,&rsquo; Survivors Say,&quot;</a> Feb. 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WPLG Local 10 ABC, <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/this-week-in-south-florida/student-officials-call-for-change-after-parkland-shooting\">&quot;Student, officials call for change after Parkland shooting,&quot;</a> Feb. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/florida-nikolas-cruz-isis/\">&quot;Was the Suspected Florida High School Shooter Affiliated with the Islamic State?&quot;</a> Feb. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/pamela-geller/\">Pamela Geller&rsquo;s Truth-O-Meter</a>, Accessed Feb. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Pamela Geller, activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, Feb. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "President of American Freedom Defense Intitiative", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Pamela", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New York", "id": 3213, "last_name": "Geller", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "pamela-geller", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 23, "party": "Activist", "party_slug": "activist", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/23/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/pamgeller.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3213/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>In Parkland, Fla. &quot;the mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a story", "statement_date": "2018-02-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
