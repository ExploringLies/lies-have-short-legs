The story is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tampa man loses testicles after trying to &#39;fill scuba tank with weed smoke&#39;,&quot; read the headline on <a href=\"http://www.floridasunpost.com/tampa-man-loses-testicles-trying-fill-scuba-tank-weed-smoke/\">an April 13, 2017, article</a> on FloridaSunPost.com. The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected the story may be fake, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to curtail fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said a Tampa man named Darren Winters &quot;had consumed a copious amount of alcohol&quot; when he decided to invite friends over to witness him use a contraption he dubbed a &quot;scuba bong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recreational diver had planned to blow smoke into a scuba tank with a compressor, then inhale it through a regulator, the story read. Winters reportedly knocked the tank off a workbench and it exploded, with shrapnel severing his genitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While those details are graphic, they&rsquo;re also completely fabricated. FloridaSunPost.com is a fake news website designed to look like a traditional news outlet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exact same story appeared on BostonLeader.com <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160923163047/http://www.bostonleader.com/boston-man-tries-fill-scuba-tank-weed-smoke-loses-testicles/\">on Sept. 16, 2016</a>, with the location changed to Boston. The name of the victim was changed to Michael Fitzpatrick &mdash; although the surname Palmer was cited once, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did Palmer come from? Another version of the same story was posted <a href=\"http://www.isthatlegit.com/calgary-man-loses-testicles-while-trying-to-fill-scuba-tank-with-weed-smoke/\">on Sept. 3</a> at IsThatLegit.com, but this time in Calgary, Canada.
