It is part of the Uniform Crime Reporting program, which includes a separate measure of nonviolent crimes. These are the statistics Flynn and Barrett cite each quarter when they tout the improvement in the city&rsquo;s violent crime numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalzak, though, says for the 20-year measure they are looking strictly at homicides.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we&rsquo;re already off on a bad track -- the campaign cherry-picked two years of data, not all the years of Barrett&rsquo;s tenure. And it used homicides as a stand-in for all violent crime.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, homicides attract the most attention. But Flynn and Barrett have regularly cited the broader number, with experts saying the murder rate alone can distort the picture. (Of the 6,446 violent crimes reported in 2009, 72 were homicides)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what we found when we crunched the numbers:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen you compare 2004, the year Barrett took office, with last year, reported violent crime incidents were 36 percent higher in 2009 than 2004.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Even if you make Barrett&rsquo;s first full year in office, 2005, the baseline year, violent crime was still 5 percent higher last year.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you look strictly at homicides, there was an 18 percent drop from 2004 to 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the Barrett campaign talks about all violent crimes -- then it morphs the homicide number into the crime rate number and carries the comparison back decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHomicides are <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/82219557.html\">at their lowest </a>point in at least two decades. But the high-water mark in terms of all violent crime since 1990 actually came during Barrett&rsquo;s tenure, in 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s going on here?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Barrett came into office on April 20, 2004, violent crime was at its lowest point during the past 20 years, thanks to a seven-year period when the numbers plummeted (see chart with this item).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett&rsquo;s second full year, 2006, was marked by a surge to the highest point since 1990. Indeed, the city was among the national leaders in a spike in violent crimes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince then, violent crime has fallen considerably, but reported incidents were still well above the 2004 level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational trends factor in. Crime experts have said the decline in violent crime that began in the 1990s was part of a long-term pattern. They cited falling crack cocaine use, a strong economy and other societal factors, with some citing tougher police strategies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLikewise, the subsequent jump was attributed to many factors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2007, Barrett himself cited a decline in federal funds for the community-oriented policing service program and the need for responsible gun legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhatever the reasons behind the trends, the Barrett campaign is playing loose with its words and the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe campaign defines its bragging about what has happened &quot;under Tom Barrett&rsquo;s leadership.&quot; But it cherry-picks the best two years to highlight, ignoring the full picture for his time in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen the campaign goes beyond Barrett&rsquo;s time in office to say violent crime is at a 20-year low. This time it picks the pit out of the cherry, using the homicide rate as a stand-in for all violent crimes. In truth, the 20-year high point for violent crime was in 2006, two years into Barrett&rsquo;s term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll that cherry-picking leaves voters with a false impression -- and leaves us with a sour taste.
