Referring to Dallet&rsquo;s defeat of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michael-screnock/\">Michael Screnock</a>, a Sauk County circuit judge backed by Walker and other conservatives, Walker said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Even Tuesday&#39;s election for the Supreme Court -- which, in the end, kind of boiled down to a ballot test between parties, even though it&#39;s supposedly nonpartisan, and that&#39;s really because Eric Holder and his group came in and made it highly partisan.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Supreme Court races have seen partisan involvement in recent years, but the 2018 race set a new standard for partisanship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see if it was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/eric-holder/\">Holder</a> -- the attorney general for most of Obama&rsquo;s presidency, who is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/30/politics/eric-holder-2020-decision-next-year/index.html\">considering a run</a> for president himself in 2020 -- who made the Supreme Court race &quot;highly partisan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Holder&rsquo;s involvement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 15 and 16, 2018, Holder <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/15/eric-holder-campaigns-dallet-gop-questions-her-ability-hear-controversial-cases/429183002/\">campaigned for Dallet</a> in Milwaukee and Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, he said the group he leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, was spending $140,000 on digital ads backing Dallet and that it might spend more. Later in the campaign, it was reported that Holder&rsquo;s committee had spent a <a href=\"http://www.wisdc.org/pr033018.php\">total of $165,000</a> to support Dallet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on election night, the group said that it and its affiliates had &quot;invested more than $500,000&quot; to elect Dallet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Note: In February 2018, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/26/eric-holders-group-sues-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-over-not-calling-special-elections/374278002/\">Holder&rsquo;s committee sued</a> Walker over his refusal to call special elections to fill two open legislative seats. The suit <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/29/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-calls-special-elections-senate-leader-drops-bill/469000002/\">successfully forced Walker</a> to call the elections.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Holder himself and his group played a major role in backing Dallet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it&rsquo;s true that as national figures, Holder and his group added a national partisan dimension to the race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Wisconsin Republican Party played a major role in backing Screnock, starting before Holder did, and it doesn&rsquo;t get much more partisan than a political party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First in -- the GOP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Months before Holder&rsquo;s involvement, Republican Party groups in Wisconsin started backing Screnock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, on Nov. 9, 2017,&nbsp;five months before election day, the Washington County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee <a href=\"https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105692JanuaryContinuing20185fa98112201855707PMCF-2Report.pdf\">gave $500 </a>to Screnock&rsquo;s campaign. Later, <a href=\"https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/KateLSpringPre-Election20186752e3262018100837PMCF-2Report.pdf\">other county parties</a>, including those in Racine, Polk, Ozaukee, Sheboygan and Walworth counties, gave to Screnock&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Feb. 8, 2018, the state GOP gave Screnock&rsquo;s campaign a <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/12/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-michael-screnock-gets-30-000-republicans/329505002/\">$31,152 in-kind donation</a>. And five days later, Screnock&rsquo;s campaign reported having received <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-michael-screnock-gets-142-000-gop-five-weeks/333389002/\">nearly $111,000</a> more from the GOP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 27, 2018, the state party <a href=\"https://www.wisgop.org/2018/03/wisgop-launches-statewide-ad-campaign-supreme-court-candidate-rebecca-dallets-attack-wi-values/\">announced a statewide</a> radio, direct mail, digital, and billboard advertisement campaign attacking Dallet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all, Screnock&rsquo;s campaign received <a href=\"http://time.com/5227350/wisconsin-supreme-court-rebecca-dallet/\">about $400,000</a> in help from the state and local Republican parties, the Associated Press reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker says &quot;Holder and his group came in and made&quot; the Wisconsin Supreme Court race &quot;highly partisan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holder came to Wisconsin in March 2018, a few weeks before election day, to campaign for Dallet. And a group he leads said it and its affiliates spent more than $500,000 backing Dallet. That added a national partisan dimension to the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you can&rsquo;t get any more partisan than a political party, and county Republican Party groups started backing Screnock months earlier, in November 2017. Ultimately, Republican Party groups, led by the state party, backed Screnock to the tune of some $400,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only some truth, we give Walker a Mostly False.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-10T13:43:17.410312", "ruling_date": "2018-04-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker claim of Eric Holder making Supreme Court race 'highly partisan' ignores GOP role ", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-claim-eric-holder-making-supreme-cour", "ruling_link_text": "Heavy involvement by GOP came first", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>iHeart.com, <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/139-The-Jay-Weber-Show-28167130/episode/governor-scott-walker-on-the-show-29163659/?campid=ls_ihrshow&amp;pname=1176&amp;cid=%2Ffeatured%2Fthe-jay-weber-show%2F\">Jay Weber interview of Scott Walker</a> (4:50), April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Scott Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg, April 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/15/eric-holder-campaigns-dallet-gop-questions-her-ability-hear-controversial-cases/429183002/\">&quot;Eric Holder campaigns for Rebecca Dallet as GOP questions her ability to hear controversial cases on Wisconsin Supreme Court,&quot;</a> March 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/12/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-michael-screnock-gets-30-000-republicans/329505002/\">&quot;Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Michael Screnock gets $30,000 from Republicans,&quot;</a> Feb. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, <a href=\"http://time.com/5227350/wisconsin-supreme-court-rebecca-dallet/\">&quot;A Boon for Democrats as Liberal Wins Wisconsin Supreme Court Race,&quot;</a> April 4, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-michael-screnock-gets-142-000-gop-five-weeks/333389002/\">&quot;Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Michael Screnock gets $142,000 from GOP in five weeks,&quot;</a> Feb. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, <a href=\"http://www.wisdc.org/pr033018.php\">news release</a>, March 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Republican Party, <a href=\"https://www.wisgop.org/2018/03/wisgop-launches-statewide-ad-campaign-supreme-court-candidate-rebecca-dallets-attack-wi-values/\">news release</a>, March 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Election Commission, <a href=\"https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105692JanuaryContinuing20185fa98112201855707PMCF-2Report.pdf\">Michael Screnock campaign finance report</a>, January 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Election Commission, <a href=\"https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/KateLSpringPre-Election20186752e3262018100837PMCF-2Report.pdf\">Michael Screnock campaign finance report</a>, March 26, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Election Commission, <a href=\"https://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/65cb3d40eaa64e47be1c3673d5cbf42a42201880304AM.pdf\">Michael Screnock campaign finance report</a>, March 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Democratic Redistricting Committee, news release, April 3, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Says &quot;Eric Holder and his group came in and made&quot;
