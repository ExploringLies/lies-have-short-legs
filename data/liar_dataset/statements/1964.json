Michael McCaul&rsquo;s wealth in remarks to the Democrats with Disabilities caucus at the Texas Democratic State Convention in Corpus Christi.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Austin lawyer &quot;is the sixth-richest person in Congress,&quot; Ankrum said Friday.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe scurried to check.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we followed up with Ankrum, he immediately said he should have described McCaul as the sixth-richest member of the House &mdash; not all of Congress. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow would Ankrum know? Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, annually examines financial disclosure filings by members of Congress and ranks the 50 richest members by calculating their minimum net worths. On the disclosure filings, members don&rsquo;t reveal exactly what they&rsquo;re worth. Instead, they indicate assets and liabilities within broad categories such as $1 to $1,000, up to more than $50 million. Roll Call estimates each member&rsquo;s net worth by calculating the lowest possible total assets and subtracting the lowest possible liabilities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to Roll Call&rsquo;s latest assessment, based on members&rsquo; 2008 submissions, McCaul was then the 11th-richest member of Congress, and the sixth-richest House member. McCaul&rsquo;s estimated net worth that year: $38.08 million. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe sixth-richest member that year, according to Roll Call&rsquo;s research, was Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, with an estimated net worth of $71 million.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;McCaul&rsquo;s assets grew by at least $14 million in 2008,&quot; Roll Call said, &quot;a jump of nearly 60 percent from his reported minimum value the year before. McCaul holds the largest percentage increase in wealth among any member.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRoll Call also reported that many lawmakers on its top-50 list had suffered steep financial losses, reporting a combined loss of more than $275 million from their combined estimated net worths in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRoll Call said McCaul&rsquo;s boost in wealth reflected a significant jump in some of his wife&rsquo;s investments, which were valued at a minimum of $25 million. McCaul&rsquo;s father-in-law is Lowry Mays, the founder of media giant Clear Channel Communications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe checked in with McCaul&rsquo;s campaign, whose spokesman Mike Rosen, didn&rsquo;t quibble with the ranking. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOverall, 28 Democrats and 22 Republicans made the publication&rsquo;s top-50 list. The most flush member of Congress that year was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., with an estimated net worth of $167.55 million. Other Texans in the money: U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Irving, ranked 25th with an estimated net worth of $11.89 million, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, came in 35th at $7.14 million and Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, landed 46th at $5.91 million. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSumming up (ahem): Ankrum misspoke because McCaul, by the latest ranking, is the the sixth-richest member of the House, not Congress. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, the punch line is about the same; McCaul was better off than most colleagues. We rate Ankrum&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-25T19:19:39.394935", "ruling_date": "2010-06-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ankrum says McCaul is the sixth-richest member of Congress", "ruling_headline_slug": "ankrum-says-mccaul-sixth-richest-member-congress", "ruling_link_text": "Sixth-richest in the House, 11th-richest including senators", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRoll Call, <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/features/Guide-to-Congress_2009/guide/38181-1.html?page=1\" target=\"_blank\">The 50 richest members of Congress,</a> Sept. 14, 2009</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRep.
