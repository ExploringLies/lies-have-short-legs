But he spoke for the agency five days later when House members quizzed him about what happened in a hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., explicitly asked Comey if Clinton lied to the FBI in that interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comey&rsquo;s response: &quot;I have no basis for concluding that she was untruthful with us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a line of questioning with then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., Comey reiterated, &quot;We do not have a basis for concluding she lied to the FBI.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another exchange with then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in which Comey repeatedly said he was not aware of any FBI case in which Clinton lied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Chaffetz</strong>: &quot;So Hillary Clinton did come to possess documents and materials that contained classified information via e-mail on these unsecured servers is that correct?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Comey</strong>: &quot;That is correct.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Chaffetz</strong>: &quot;Did Hillary Clinton lie?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Comey</strong>: &quot;To the FBI?

Not in a case we&#39;re working.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distinction between what Clinton told the FBI and what she told the public is important. Clinton earned a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-wrong-claim-fbi-director-comey-ca/\">Pants on Fire</a> for claiming that, regarding the presence of classified information in her email, &quot;Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I&#39;ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was a rosy review of reality. Comey had specifically sidestepped whether she provided accurate information to the public. In particular, Clinton said there wasn&rsquo;t any classified information in her email in media interviews, and Comey said there was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Trump&rsquo;s charge said Clinton lied to the FBI, and the agency has made no such claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We at PolitiFact don&#39;t know exactly what Clinton told FBI investigators.&nbsp;We also know, however, that Trump failed to back up his allegation.&nbsp;Former FBI director Comey in congressional testimony said there was no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-04T17:37:23.116568", "ruling_date": "2017-12-05T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump falsely claims Hillary Clinton lied to FBI", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-falsely-claims-hillary-clinton-lied-f", "ruling_link_text": "Comey said she didn't lie", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/12/04/trump-says-he-feels-very-badly-for-flynn-because-lies-to-fbi-have-ruined-his-life/\">Trump says he feels &lsquo;very badly&rsquo; for Flynn because lies to FBI have &lsquo;ruined his life&rsquo;</a>, Dec. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, @realdonaldtrump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937141061343956992\">tweet</a>, Dec. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-interviewed-by-fbi-1467478221\">Hillary Clinton Interviewed by FBI in Email Probe</a>, July 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CQ, Transcript - House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Holds Hearing on FBI Recommendations on Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#39;s Email Server, Panel 1, July 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/01/flynns-guilty-plea-confirms-he-talked-russian-sanc/\">Flynn&rsquo;s guilty plea confirms he talked Russian sanctions, misled FBI</a>, Dec. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/may/17/who-robert-mueller-new-special-counsel-leading-rus/\">Who is Robert Mueller?
