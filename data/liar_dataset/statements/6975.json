Betty Sutton and Republican Rep. Jim Renacci is among the nation&rsquo;s most costly and hard-fought races, and has also devolved into one of the nastiest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter Renacci placed ads accusing Sutton of &quot;voting to raise taxes on just about everyone,&quot; Sutton fired back with an ad that claims Renacci supports tax breaks for millionaires like himself and &quot;tried to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million that he made.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We play by the rules but Renacci thinks he&rsquo;s above them,&quot; says a male blue collar worker shown in Sutton&rsquo;s ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the same day that Sutton unveiled the ad that accuses Renacci of avoiding taxes, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made a similar assertion in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXJ0tsi40s&amp;feature=youtu.be\">different ad</a>, which says: &quot;Renacci tried to skip out on paying over a million in taxes.&quot;.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tax avoidance claims in Sutton&rsquo;s new ad echo charges that were raised against Renacci in 2010, when he first ran for Congress and defeated Democratic Rep. John Boccieri. They stem from a dispute Renacci had with the Ohio Department of Taxation, which accused him and his wife, Tina, of misreporting their income in 2000 and assessed them nearly $1.4 million in back taxes, interest and penalties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Renaccis filed state tax returns that claimed they had a loss of $247,336 that year, but auditors determined they actually made $13,730,440. The couple filed a tax appeal when the state dinged them for $954,650 in back taxes, $146,938 in interest and $293,876 in penalties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe quarrel was over Renacci&#39;s trust income from an &quot;S&quot; corporation, which wasn&rsquo;t taxable for several years before Ohio&#39;s tax commissioner changed the state&rsquo;s policy. S corporations permit income to be taxed at an individual rate for federal tax purposes, and avoid double taxation on corporate income. Renacci was among a group of taxpayers who fought the state decision. He contended the trust income should have been tax-free and that he had &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to exclude it on his tax return, tax department and court documents say.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOthers dropped their appeals, but Renacci continued to fight, even after a 2006 Ohio Supreme Court ruling in a similar case in which the court said the trust income was subject to taxation. In that case, the taxpayers reported their S Corporation income on their 2000 tax return and then unsuccessfully asked for a refund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2007 legal brief the state of Ohio filed in Renacci&rsquo;s case observed that nearly all other litigants &quot;who created grantor trusts in an attempt to shelter, i.e., exclude their S corporation income from Ohio income taxation&quot; gave up their appeals, and that the Renaccis were &quot;almost alone in their persistence.&quot; Court records show the Renaccis eventually sent the state more than $1.3 million, but they continue to argue that $359,822 that they paid in penalties and interest were improper.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He was proud of his fight, and to have fought till the end, along with many other Ohioans for tax fairness,&quot; Renacci spokesman James Slepian told the Plain Dealer in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked about Sutton&rsquo;s new ad, &nbsp;Slepian this month called her &quot;a desperate politician who knows she&rsquo;s losing and has no record to run on,&quot; and said she&rsquo;s &nbsp;engaging in &quot;the bogus, gutter politics of recycled personal attacks that have defined her sad career in Congress.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the charges against Renacci are somewhat recycled. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union placed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwoQ3EiqUck&amp;feature=player_embedded\">a television ad</a>&nbsp;in 2010 that contained a more extreme version of the charges that Sutton is making.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat ad said he &quot;cheated on his income taxes,&quot; that he &quot;hid&quot; more than $13 million and was forced to pay $1.4 million in back taxes and penalties. &nbsp;Renacci filed a defamation suit against the union after the ads began to air. <a href=\"http://www.starkcountycjis.org/starkcrt/docket_frame?pass_case_number=2010CV03065&amp;pass_case_type=CV\">Court records</a>&nbsp;show he dropped the case on Feb. 3, 2011, shortly after he took office in Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/aug/27/afscme/afscme-ad-calls-ohio-congressional-candidate-jim-r/\">PolitiFact Ohio found</a>&nbsp;a claim in that ad to be Mostly True because Renacci could have disclosed the trust income on his state tax return, as the state warned he should, but he didn&rsquo;t. He also could have paid the taxes and contested the amount, but didn&rsquo;t. And he didn&rsquo;t amend his return, despite an explicit 2002 warning from Ohio&rsquo;s tax Department that he could face penalties for fraud and failure to pay if he didn&rsquo;t. But Renacci ultimately worked within the system to resolve the case, paid the full amount that was due, and was not ever charged with tax fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim in this ad is an easier call. Reams of legal documents show that Renacci battled with the state over trust income from an S corporation, trying to avoid paying taxes on the $13.7 million at issue in the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Sutton&rsquo;s claim rates True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-21T16:11:04.728016", "ruling_date": "2012-10-22T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Betty Sutton says Jim Renacci tried to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million", "ruling_headline_slug": "betty-sutton-says-jim-renacci-tried-avoid-paying-t", "ruling_link_text": "He battled the state in court, but ultimately paid", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/10/special_interests_boost_ad_buy.html\">Special interests boost ad buys in race between Betty Sutton and Jim Renacci</a>, Oct. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/10/rep_jim_renacci_is_still_dispu.html\">Rep.
