The catch and deaths are fabricated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is a shorter version of a June 20, 2016, post published on World News Daily Report, a satirical news site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve heard a few times about this story, and there&#39;s no fact to it,&quot; said Christopher Yaw, a spokesperson for the District Nine Coast Guard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great white sharks can&rsquo;t swim in freshwater, as it dilutes their internal salt levels. That dehydrates them and decreases their buoyancy, so that they sink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story quotes a biology professor at the University of Illinois on the rarity of the find, but a search of his name on the university&rsquo;s database yielded no results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post claims there was a 1916 shark attack in Lake Eerie that led to a 14 year swimming ban, but we found no traces of this attack or a ban. The most famous actual 1916 attack occurred on the Jersey Shore, in salt water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found no credible reports of disappearances on the lake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A disclaimer at the bottom of the story calls NotAllowedTo.com a satire entertainment website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on this Web Site,&quot; a disclaimer reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim is bogus.
