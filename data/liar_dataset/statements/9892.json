Her father, Sam Nunn was a respected moderate Democrat in the U.S. Senate for 24 years, from 1972 to 1997, who some considered White House or vice presidential material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad follows the theme of the super PAC&rsquo;s new website, <a href=\"http://www.absolutelynunn.com/\">www.AbsolutelyNunn.com</a>, which answers the question, is there any reason for Georgians to vote for her?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, PolitiFact Georgia wondered, is Nunn working with felons to win office?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at Ending Spending Action Fund, formed by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts. As of Sept. 11, the group has spent nearly $2.8 million -- more than any other outside group -- on Georgia&rsquo;s Senate race, according to OpenSecrets.org.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PAC favors Nunn&rsquo;s GOP opponent, businessman David Perdue. Some of its money paid for ads during the contentious Republican primary earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The race is being closely watched, and heavily funded, nationally because of the tight battle for control of the U.S. Senate. It&rsquo;s also a priority for state Democrats eager to reclaim a major statewide office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nunn-Perdue battle has drawn the fifth-most money from outside groups in Congressional races across the nation this year, $12.4 million on ads from both sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That brings us back to the ad, which is a reference to the July 8 Washington, D.C. fundraiser that featured Sam Nunn as a special guest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual Murrell is listed as one of the co-hosts of the event, giving $2,600 to Nunn&rsquo;s campaign for the honor. Guests paid at least $250 to the campaign to attend, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_KEK8-LWmzhQTRxUVJnVWVzbTg/edit?pli=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the invitation</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days after the fundraiser, the conservative National Review broke the story that Murrell, now a political consultant, had pleaded guilty in 1995 to accepting a bribe while working as an Oakland (Calif.) City councilman&rsquo;s aide. He was sentenced to a year in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn expressed surprise at the news of Murrell&rsquo;s history, which also includes a stint in the 1960s as a leader in the Black Panther movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her campaign declined this week to make her available to discuss the fundraiser and its fallout. Spokesman Nathan Click referred us to a statement released in July, which said Nunn was unaware of Murrell&rsquo;s record and promised to return contributions linked to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click, however, declined to confirm the exact amount of money the campaign said was returned or to disclose how much money was tied to Murrell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We didn&#39;t deposit any contributions from him or anything he&nbsp;raised&nbsp;for the&nbsp;event,&quot; Click said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Murrell via email, to confirm that Nunn returned his donation and other he raised. He did not respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also contacted Brian Baker, Ending Spending&rsquo;s president, who said Nunn has acknowledged Murrell, a convicted felon, co-hosted a fundraiser for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That &quot;is exactly what we say in the ad,&quot; Baker said. &quot;The ad is 100 percent factual.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event wasn&rsquo;t the campaign&rsquo;s only embarrassing moment. &nbsp;In late August, a series of confidential memos were leaked, revealing Nunn&rsquo;s campaign strategy and vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, those documents may support the campaign&rsquo;s contention that Nunn didn&rsquo;t know Murrell&rsquo;s background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On page 57 of the 144-page document &ndash; after listing vulnerabilities such as being linked to President Obama and before several pages laying out campaign issues &ndash; is a category called &quot;Vetting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes up less than a quarter of the page, most notably this one-sentence paragraph:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Currently, there are no plans to vet donors to the campaign,&quot; the memo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker said finding out Murrell&rsquo;s background &quot;didn&rsquo;t require a complicated vetting process&quot; and was accessible with a basic Google search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia has reviewed previous ad claims from the group, with mixed results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August, Ending Spending ad&rsquo;s claim that Michelle Nunn&rsquo;s &quot;foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists&quot; earned a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1oLoxpo\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July, we rated as <a href=\"http://bit.ly/UxPHUM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a> an Ending Spending claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light around the time it laid off 90 workers due to its merger with the nonprofit Hands on Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Available information on the latest claim suggests Ending Spending&rsquo;s new ad uses guilt by association in a bid to suggest Nunn knowingly wooed an inflammatory ex-convict to raise cash for her Senate bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn has repeatedly said she did not know Murrell&rsquo;s history when she attended the fundraiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She pledged to give back the money he raised, though the campaign and Murrell have not confirmed how much was determined to be linked to Murrell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the statement from the Ending Spending attack ad is correct. A convicted felon did host a fundraiser for Michelle Nunn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn has said she did not know anything about the man&rsquo;s criminal background. And there is evidence from a leaked memo that her campaign was not vetting donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is accurate. But it leaves out some relevant details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-11T15:24:17.252740", "ruling_date": "2014-09-12T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Super PAC attacks Nunn fundraising blunder", "ruling_headline_slug": "super-pac-attacks-nunn-fundraising-blunder", "ruling_link_text": "Felon served as co-host of event", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ending Spending Action Fund, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEHknfmTQBY&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><strong>Nunn on the street</strong></a>,&quot; Aug. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michelle Nunn event invitation, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_KEK8-LWmzhQTRxUVJnVWVzbTg/edit?pli=1\"><strong>July 8 fundraiser</strong></a>, Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Review, &quot;<strong><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/382450/felon-former-black-panther-party-leader-hosts-fundraiser-democratic-senate-candidate\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Felon, Former Black Panther Party Leader Hosts Fundraiser for Democratic Senate Candidate Michelle Nunn</u></a></strong>,&quot; July 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/michelle-nunn-return-cash-linked-ex-con\"><strong>Michelle Nunn to return cash linked to ex-con</strong></a>,&quot; July 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlanta Journal-Constitution Political insider, &quot;<a href=\"http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/07/11/michelle-nunns-felon-fundraiser/\"><strong>Michelle Nunn&rsquo;s felon fundraiser</strong></a>,&quot; July 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets.org, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?cycle=2014&amp;chrt=V&amp;disp=O&amp;type=S\"><strong>&quot;2014 Outside Spending, by Super PAC</strong></a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/summ.php?disp=R\"><strong>2014 Outside Spending, by race</strong></a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/races/indexp.php?cycle=2014&amp;id=GAS1\"><strong>Georgia Senate race, outside spending</strong></a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Brian Baker, president of Ending Spending Action Fund, Sept. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Nathan Click, spokesman for Michelle Nunn, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, Sept. 10 and Sept. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2780, "last_name": "Ending Spending Action Fund", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "ending-spending-action-fund", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouette_15.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2780/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://endingspendingfund.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Michelle Nunn has acknowledged allowing a convicted felon to hold a fundraiser for her.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio ad", "statement_date": "2014-08-29", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
