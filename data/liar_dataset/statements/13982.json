John Kasich appear to degrade women while discussing abortion actually is a bogus story first posted on an often-cited parody website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline on a <a href=\"http://walkwithher.com/kasich-if-a-woman-is-not-intelligent-enough-to-keep-her-legs-closed-how-can-we-entrust-the-abortion-decision-to-her\">March 28, 2017, post</a> on WalkWithHer.com read, &quot;Kasich: &lsquo;If a woman is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed, how can we entrust the abortion decision to her?&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to clear fake news from users&rsquo; news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kasich allegedly made the remarks after vetoing the so-called &quot;heartbeat bill,&quot; a bill that would have outlawed abortion in Ohio once a fetal heartbeat could be detected. At the same time, he signed a bill that made abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy illegal, unless the mother&rsquo;s life was in danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post, which is fake, said Kasich defended his actions by saying women weren&rsquo;t as strong as they were in &quot;the old times.&quot; They made poor decisions for themselves, including abortions, so Kasich had to take action, the article said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they&rsquo;re supposed to be closed, if she doesn&rsquo;t have the foresight to make sure she doesn&rsquo;t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion,&quot; the post quoted Kasich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Kasich did <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/12/13/John-Kasich-acts-on-abortion-bills.html\">take those actions on both of those bills</a> on Dec. 13, 2016, the quote attributed him is made up entirely, as is the rest of the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s another example of a story taken from Newslo.com, which first ran the parody post <a href=\"http://www.newslo.com/kasich-woman-not-intelligent-enough-keep-legs-closed-can-entrust-abortion-decision/\">on Dec. 15</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newslo.com is the umbrella site for a family of online parody outlets, and <a href=\"http://www.newslo.com/about-us/\">refers to itself in a disclaimer</a> as &quot;the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.&quot; Newslo.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, at an <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/newslo.com\">address in Greece</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there&rsquo;s no way to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to contact WalkWithHer.com <a href=\"http://walkwithher.com/contact\">through an email address</a> with a Russian domain code, but didn&rsquo;t receive a reply.

WalkWithHer.com&rsquo;s post doesn&rsquo;t indicate the story is made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But WalkWithHer.com does have a feature we haven&rsquo;t often seen on fake news sites: A <a href=\"http://walkwithher.com/dmca-removal-request#\">link to information</a> on how to make a <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmca_executive.html\">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> removal request.
