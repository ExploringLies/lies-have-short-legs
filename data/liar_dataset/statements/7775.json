And should he win, Meyer said his youth would give him valuable insight into issues facing young Americans, including a lackluster employment outlook.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;Only three in 10 young Americans under 30 &nbsp;-- 30 percent under 30 -- have full-time work,&quot; Meyer said while announcing his candidacy in a recent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTgE7Zpxzk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">interview</a> on Fox News.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe wondered whether Meyer was correct.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMeyer told us he based his claim on a February 2013 <a href=\"http://www.ncoc.net/MillennialsCHI\">report</a> about civic engagement among 18-29 year olds that was sponsored by the National Conference on Citizenship, Harvard University&rsquo;s Institute of Politics and several other groups.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOne of the findings is that the Millennial Generation -- which the study defined as those born between 1983 and 1994 -- has been hit hard by the sluggish economy. Researchers, computing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, looked at 18-29 year-olds&nbsp; and found &quot;62.9 percent are currently working, of which 31.2 percent work on a part-time basis.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMeyer interpreted those figures to mean that the remaining 31.7 percent who were employed had a full time job.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut his interpretation &quot;isn&rsquo;t quite right,&quot; according to Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, a co-author of the report and lead researcher at CIRCLE, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tShe pointed out the study said that <em>of</em> the 62.9 percent employed, 31.2 percent held part-time &nbsp;jobs -- or slightly less than a third of those in the age group who are working.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo when all Americans in that age group are considered -- those employed and those who are not &nbsp;-- about 20 percent have part-time positions and 43 percent have full time jobs, Kawashima-Ginsberg said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s another issue to consider. The figures were compiled using November 2011 data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tKawashima-Ginsberg ran new figures for us, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. For March 2013, she came up with a similar result: 42 percent of people age 18-29 had full-time jobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOf people 30 and older, 50.4 percent had full-time job in March, according to figures compiled by Kawashima-Ginsberg.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCraig Copeland, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefits Research Institute, said economic changes have made it harder for young people to find jobs. But there&rsquo;s another important factor to consider when looking at full-time employment among the 18-29 age group -- many of them are working part time until they leave college.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;There is a significant percentage of those people who are (working) part-time for a reason, not because they can&rsquo;t find a job,&quot; Copeland said. &quot;If they&rsquo;re working part-time, they&rsquo;re most likely a college student.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOver the last decade or so, the number of young people holding a full-time job has trended downwards, even before the Great Recession, Copeland said. The reason is that a higher percentage of that group has been going to college and because members of the Baby Boom generation are staying in jobs longer, Copeland said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut the recession, which ran from December 2007 to June 2009, certainly caused the percentage with full-time jobs to go down faster, he said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCopeland pulled annual average employment figures from the U.S. Census showing that in 2004, 54.1 percent of people age 18-29 had a full-time job and that dropped &nbsp;to 52.6 percent by 2008. By 2011 -- the latest yearly figures available -- the percent of 18-29 year olds with a full-time job was 45.6 percent, he said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMeyer said that 30 percent of the Americans younger than 30 had full-time jobs, but he misinterpreted data in a report. The study actually indicates that 43 percent of the age group had full time jobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhile Meyer&rsquo;s number is off, his point holds up: a smaller portion of 18-29 year olds hold full time jobs today that before the recession. We rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-12T22:42:00.154522", "ruling_date": "2013-05-13T13:02:16", "ruling_headline": "Ron Meyer says 30 percent of Americans under 30 have full-time jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "ron-meyer-says-30-percent-workers-under-30-have-fu", "ruling_link_text": "Misinterprets data", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-27431e88-9bbf-44a3-736b-7a16aa14ad9c\">\r\n\tRon Meyer, Jr. interview on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTgE7Zpxzk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">&quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto,&quot;</a> April 29, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tE-mail from Ron Meyer, May 2, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNational Conference on Citizenship, <a href=\"http://www.ncoc.net/MillennialsCHI\">&quot;&lsquo;Millennials&rsquo; play a central role in our nation&rsquo;s civic health, but who are they?&quot;</a> Feb. 6, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNational Conference on Citizenship, &quot;Millennials civic health index,&quot; Feb 6, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tE-mails from Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, lead researcher at the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, May 8-9, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterview with Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, May 9, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterviews with Craig Copeland, senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 10, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe Washington Examiner, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-just-6-in-10-millennials-have-jobs-half-are-part-time/article/2520719\">&quot;Just 6 in 10 Millennials have jobs, half are part-time,&quot;</a> Feb. 7, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/millennials/\">&quot;Millennials: A portrait of Generation Next,&quot;&nbsp;</a> February, 2010.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics,<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat03.htm\">&quot;Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population by age, sex and race,&quot;</a> accessed May 9, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics &quot;Employed and unemployed full- and part-time workers by age, sex race and detailed Hispanic or Latino ethnicity annual average 2012,&quot; accessed May 9, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, current population survey, accessed May 9, 2013.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Press secretary", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Ron", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 2296, "last_name": "Meyer", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "ron-meyer", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/RonM-8626.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2296/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://ronmeyer.com/"}, "statement": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-27431e88-9ba2-319f-f126-e2cb66a40e04\">\r\n\t&quot;Only three in 10 young Americans under 30 -- 30 percent under 30 -- have full-time work.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV interview.", "statement_date": "2013-04-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
