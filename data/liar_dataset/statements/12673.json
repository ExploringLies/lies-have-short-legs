Harry Reid is spending roughly $850,000 on a new ad attempting to paint Republican Rep. Joe Heck as a creature of Wall Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9MtQ8YDz1w\">Senate Majority PAC&rsquo;s</a> new ad suggests that banks &quot;invested&quot; in the Republican Senate hopeful through campaign donations, and that their investment paid off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They&rsquo;ve invested over $300,000 in him, and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks,&quot; the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9MtQ8YDz1w\">ad states</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ad marks one of the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?id=NVS2&amp;cycle=2016\">largest chunks of outside spending</a> in the highly competitive Nevada Senate race. But claiming banks invested in Heck and then received tax breaks takes an acrobatic chronology of what actually happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Donations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over his entire congressional career, Heck has actually raised more than the $300,000 amount from the banking industry referenced in the ad. The most recent figure from the &quot;secruities and investment&quot; category on the nonpartisan <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00031244&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=20\">opensecrets.org</a> is $473,819.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this is a career-wide total, and it includes the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=2016&amp;type=C&amp;cid=N00031244&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=20\">$381,700</a> raised for his ongoing Senate run. Heck raised $92,119, a much more modest figure, for his other three congressional runs combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of money, but it&rsquo;s worth taking the typically massive size of congressional fundraising hauls into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Heck&rsquo;s $35,472 in donations from the &quot;securities and investment&quot; industry during his successful 2014 re-election bid is a drop in the bucket compared to the total <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?id=NV03&amp;cycle=2014\">$2.4 million</a> raised throughout that campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as for references to &quot;investing,&quot; the tax breaks mentioned in the ad actually refer to a bill Heck championed as a state senator &mdash; years before the $300,000 in donations referenced in the ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck did take campaign funds from banks and their associated PACs during this time. A PolitiFact tally found that Heck <a href=\"https://nvsos.gov/SOSCandidateServices/AnonymousAccess/CEFDSearchUU/CandidateDetails.aspx?o=92Y5W9aJNOGqUVjM8iMy9A%253d%253d\">received</a> around $21,800 from the banking industry through his four years in the state Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, that isn&rsquo;t a small figure, but it&rsquo;s a much smaller amount than what Heck raked in from the state&rsquo;s casino giants and the medical industry over the same time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tax breaks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the donations, Heck did sponsor an ultimately failed piece of legislation in the state Senate that sought to reduce the payroll tax burden on Nevada financial institutions &mdash; what the ad calls &quot;$44 million in tax breaks for banks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the ad prominently features a looming image of the U.S. Capitol Dome, the bill would have only applied to Nevada banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/nevada/statements/2016/mar/29/michael-roberson/candidate-claiming-nevada-cut-taxes-2015-doesnt-pa/\">previously explored</a> the somewhat confusing history of Nevada&rsquo;s payroll tax (also called the <a href=\"http://tax.nv.gov/FAQs/Modified_Business_Tax_Information___FAQ_s/\">Modified Business Tax</a>, or MBT), created as a compromise to fund new K-12 education programs during a fierce 2003 battle over new taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State lawmakers historically fiddle with the exact rates and exemptions levels for the payroll tax, but there has been one constant &mdash; banks and other financial institutions are charged at a higher rate than any other business (2 percent), and also pay so-called &quot;franchise taxes&quot; for each branch office past the first one in each county ($7,000 a year).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevada bankers have long grumbled about the higher tax rates, and have attempted to reduce them back down to the level paid by other state businesses, <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/78th2015/ExhibitDocument/OpenExhibitDocument?exhibitId=13432&amp;fileDownloadName=AB464_NBA_Testimony.pdf\">most recently in 2015</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what Heck was doing in 2007 when he introduced <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/74th2007/Reports/history.cfm?ID=575\">SB 233</a>, which proposed rolling back the payroll tax rate on banks to the level applied to other state businesses and repealing the &quot;franchise tax&quot; for multiple branch offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saying the bill was about &quot;equity and fairness,&quot; Heck <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/74th2007/Minutes/Senate/TAX/Final/566.pdf\">argued</a> that the higher rate applied to banks created more tax revenue than projected and stifled the industry&rsquo;s economic growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This could be a bill about basket weavers,&quot; he said at <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/74th2007/Minutes/Senate/TAX/Final/566.pdf\">a committee hearing</a>. &quot;This bill is about&nbsp;an inequitable system that singles out an industry for a tax the rest of business and industry does not pay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats on the committee said banks were uniquely prepared to handle a higher tax burden, and that they weren&rsquo;t suffering at the time despite the higher taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have not seen a bank go out of business in this state; the banks I am aware of are setting&nbsp;record profits,&quot; Democratic state Sen. Mike Schneider said during a hearing on the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the tax-cut figure, both the state&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/74th2007/FiscalNotes/3238.pdf\">Taxation Department</a> and <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.nv.us/74th/Exhibits/Senate/TAX/STAX566F.pdf\">Heck himself</a> estimated the legislation would cost the state around $44.2 million in revenue &mdash; a little more than $38 million in payroll taxes and another $5.9 million by axing the branch franchise tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck pointed out that those cuts would make up less than 1 percent of the state&rsquo;s $6.9 billion two-year budget. The bill itself would have affected around <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/74th2007/FiscalNotes/3238.pdf\">2,450 Nevada businesses</a> at the time, and the amended version would have lowered the tax for the 55,000 businesses paying the payroll levy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck wasn&rsquo;t the only Republican leading the charge on reducing the tax burden for banks, as former Gov. Jim Gibbons made repealing the bank franchise tax a priority in his 2007 <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/74th2007/SOS/SOS.cfm\">State of the State</a> address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the bill went nowhere. After being amended and passed out of committee, Senate leaders placed it in legislative limbo and let it expire without any more votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although lawmakers approved major changes to the state&rsquo;s payroll tax in 2015, the higher rate on financial institutions hasn&rsquo;t changed since 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate Majority PAC spokesman Shripal Shah said the measure indicated to the banking industry that Heck would be in their corner if elected to Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Banks have invested in Joe Heck&#39;s campaigns because they know he has a history of working for their interests and would continue doing their bidding in the Senate if he has the opportunity,&quot; he said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless, this isn&rsquo;t the first time Heck&rsquo;s opponents have tried to ding him over the proposal. Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/elections/heck-titus-sharp-matchup\">criticized him over it</a> during a 2010 debate between the two House candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck responded with largely the same language he used in testifying for the bill in 2007, saying the point was to make the state&rsquo;s tax system more equitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new ad from Senate Majority PAC claims banks &quot;have invested over $300,000 in him, and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implication that funds raised from the banking industry were an &quot;investment&quot; in Heck is highly misleading. The majority of bank donations came during Heck&rsquo;s current run for U.S. Senate, nine years after sponsoring a bill that would have lowered the payroll tax rate for banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because it&rsquo;s so misleading, we rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-12T17:28:05.127610", "ruling_date": "2016-07-12T17:25:16", "ruling_headline": "TV ad by Senate Majority PAC misleads on Joe Heck's bank donations, proposed tax breaks", "ruling_headline_slug": "senate-majority-pac-releases-misleading-tv-ad-agai", "ruling_link_text": "One thing did not lead to another", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Anna Thornley, President of Nevada Taxpayers Association, June 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Brian Baluta, Dr. Joe Heck for U.S. Senate spokesman, June 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Shripal Shah, Communications Director of Senate Majority PAC, June 6-12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Joe Heck For U.S. Senate, &quot;<a href=\"https://drjoeheck.com/news-releases/fact-check-of-harry-reid-super-pacs-latest-900000-smear-of-dr-joe-heck/\">Fact check of Harry Reid super PAC&rsquo;s latest $900,000 smear of Dr. Joe Heck</a>,&quot; June 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/nevada/statements/2016/mar/29/michael-roberson/candidate-claiming-nevada-cut-taxes-2015-doesnt-pa/\">Candidate claiming that Nevada cut taxes in 2015 doesn&#39;t pass muster</a>,&quot; March 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/reid-boxer-help-out-senate-dems-079910#ixzz284jOi3HQ\">Reid, Boxer help out Senate Dems</a>,&quot; August 20, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Las Vegas Review-Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/elections/heck-titus-sharp-matchup\">Heck, Titus sharp in matchup</a>,&quot; Oct. 15, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20070323/ELECTIONS/103230118\">Nevada lawmakers seeking repeal of banking tax</a>,&quot; March 23, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim Gibbons, <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/74th2007/SOS/SOS.cfm\">State of the State address</a>, January 22, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Las Vegas Review-Journal, &quot;Nevada banking advocates lobby to overturn extra tax,&quot; Nov. 24, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Banker, &quot;Nev.
