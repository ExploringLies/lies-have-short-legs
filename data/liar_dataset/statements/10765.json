On the Sunday shows, Schweizer said that while his research uncovered no proof of a quid pro quo between foreign interests and the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, the evidence does suggest a troubling trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/04/26/author-peter-schweizer-on-following-clinton-cash-trail/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>April 26</u></a> interview on <em>Fox News Sunday</em>, host Chris Wallace highlighted a claim from Schweizer&rsquo;s book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have an interesting point that I want to put up on the screen that seems to demonstrate exactly the point you&#39;re making,&quot; Wallace said. &quot;Between 2001 and 2012, Bill Clinton made 13 speeches, 13, for which he was paid $500,000 or more. Eleven of those 13 speeches were at least eight years after he left the presidency while his wife was secretary of state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schweizer responded, noting that Bill Clinton&rsquo;s speaking fees &quot;dramatically&quot; went up when Hillary Clinton, now a presidential candidate, took office in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you have one or two examples, it&#39;s a coincidence,&quot; he said. &quot;When you have this many, to me it&#39;s a trend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We aren&rsquo;t going to dig into the truthfulness of Schweizer&rsquo;s overall thesis&nbsp;here. But we are interested in Bill Clinton&rsquo;s speaking fees while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department. His book says,&quot;Of the 13 Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/us/politics/new-book-clinton-cash-questions-foreign-donations-to-foundation.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to</u></a> the <em>New York Times</em>, which has an advance copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>By the millions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014,&nbsp;before <em>Clinton Cash</em> was in the public eye,&nbsp;the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-clintons-went-from-dead-broke-to-rich-bill-earned-1049-million-for-speeches/2014/06/26/8fa0b372-fd3a-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>analyzed</u></a> Clinton&rsquo;s speaking fees and found he made at least $104 million in speaking fees between 2001 through 2012 -- more than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries (though he gave more speeches within the United States).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about Clinton&rsquo;s speaking fees, we turned to Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?cid=N00000019\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>federal financial disclosure forms</u></a>, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics.

Eleven of those occurred since January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.

State Department ethics officials had to sign off on these speaking engagements, but rarely did they say Clinton could not accept payment for a particular speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s presidential campaign has staunchly denied the implication that there was some sort of quid&nbsp;pro quo for entities that contributed to the Clintons&rsquo; wealth, arguing that Schweizer&rsquo;s book does not have firm evidence of any such deal making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schweizer said, &quot;Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re not checking Schweizer&#39;s suggestion that the increased speaking fees were part of a plan to curry favor in his wife&#39;s State Department. But on the specific numbers, Schweitzer is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s financial disclosure forms from 2001 through the end of 2012 confirm Schweizer&rsquo;s claim.
