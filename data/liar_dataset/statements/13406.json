The deadline for most voters to make that request is Nov. 3, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voters who have already mailed absentee ballots back to the municipal clerk&rsquo;s office can go to the clerk&rsquo;s office and make the request for a new ballot in person. &nbsp;The deadline to request a new absentee ballot would the last day the clerk offers in-person absentee voting. &nbsp;For most clerks, that is Nov. 4, 2016, but voters should contact their municipal clerk for scheduled hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Absentee voters cannot spoil their ballot at their polling place on Election Day. &nbsp;That was prohibited by a 2011 state law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voters in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/changing-early-vote-cast/\">at least</a> three other states -- Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania -- also accommodate early voter&rsquo;s remorse, according to news articles in the past two days by the <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/1/early-voting-buyers-remorse-some-states-allow-ball/\">Washington Times</a>, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/states-early-voters-change-minds/story?id=43243947\">ABC News</a> and <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/01/early-absentee-voters-can-still-change-ballots-in-at-least-four-states.html\">Fox News</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Conference of State Legislatures doesn&rsquo;t have a list of states that allow re-casting a ballot. In some instances, it may come down to the discretion of a local election official, spokesman Mick Bullock said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump says: &quot;Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you&#39;ve made a mistake.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you do it in time -- in Wisconsin, several&nbsp;days before election day -- you can &quot;spoil&quot; your original ballot and cast a new one.
