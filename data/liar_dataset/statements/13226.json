Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely cited data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tabulates statistics annually on what percentage of Americans are covered by health insurance. The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-257.pdf\">most recent report</a> came out in September 2016, covering the year 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau found that 90.9 percent of Americans had some type of health coverage, whether it was provided by their employer, purchased independently or through a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The remainder -- 9.1 percent of Americans -- were uninsured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the key table from the report:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O9raaKwUn3kitnspumLUMlRkfCu8SHcQKjt_NhYm0dlcKLfMuQDcSuVySXQyZWuffnUfl4g8NRjRQG--jJGVd_JC5CyULCTTAlTtd2EVpiYlRiWxbBGW6kvINyugcW6bLx3HU9LE\" style=\"border:none; height:251px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was an improvement over the 89.6 percent in 2014, 86.7 percent in 2013, 84.6 percent in <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf\">2012</a>, 84.3 percent in 2011, and 83.7 percent in <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/p60-243.pdf\">2010</a> -- the year the Affordable Care Act was passed, although the law didn&rsquo;t start having a major impact for another few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, between 1999 and 2009, the insured rate bounced from a low of 83.9 percent to a high of 86.9 percent, the furthest back the Census Bureau offers the statistic online. And at the time the 2015 data was released, it was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/u.s.-insured-rate-at-historic-high/article/2601661\">framed</a> <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4490196/health-insurance-coverage-census-2015/\">as a record high</a> for insurance coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at it the opposite way, the uninsured rate fell from 16.3 percent in 2010 to 9.1 percent in 2015 -- a decline of nearly half over five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That&#39;s the highest we&#39;ve ever been in our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Census Bureau data, that&rsquo;s correct; it was just shy of 91 percent in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available.
