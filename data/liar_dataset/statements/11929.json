During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact rated one campaign ad as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/08/hillary-clinton/standing-up-but-not-alone-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True</u></a> because it implied she&rsquo;d single-handedly &quot;stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would.&quot; In another instance, we rated her comment <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/hillary-clinton/clinton-promoted-childrens-health-care/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>True</u></a> because she qualified her claim, saying she &quot;helped&quot; create the children&rsquo;s health coverage program -- along with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s revisit the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s correct that the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program -- known as CHIP -- provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, <a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/chip/chip-program-information.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to Medicaid</u></a>. Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current ad gives Clinton credit for &quot;winning&quot; legislation that congressional lawmakers passed when she was first lady.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her campaign website has a more nuanced statement: &quot;As first lady, she refused to give up when Congress defeated health care reform. Instead, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program, which now provides health coverage to more than 8 million children. Senator Ted Kennedy said that if not for Hillary, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program wouldn&rsquo;t be in existence today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The late-Sen. Kennedy received much of the credit for CHIP because the Massachusetts Democrat shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican co-sponsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, in 2007, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501343_pf.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The children&#39;s health program wouldn&#39;t be in existence today if we didn&#39;t have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,&quot; Kennedy said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She wasn&#39;t a legislator, she didn&#39;t write the law, and she wasn&#39;t the president, so she didn&#39;t make the decisions,&quot; Littlefield told the Associated Press. &quot;But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the new Clinton ad has no qualifiers, stating &quot;she&#39;s the one who&#39;s proven she can get it done&hellip; winning health care for 8&nbsp;million children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Clinton campaign ad says one of her accomplishments was &quot;winning health care for 8 million children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That statement is largely accurate. Clinton was key to creating the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for 8 million children. But the ad leaves out the contributions of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of that caveat, we rate her statement Mostly True. &nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-17T17:05:19.602120", "ruling_date": "2016-02-17T15:03:55", "ruling_headline": "Did Hillary Clinton win health care for 8 million children as first lady?", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-wrong-sanders-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Key advocate, but had help\t ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Josh Schwerin, Hillary Clinton spokesman, February 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicaid.gov, &quot;<a href=\" https://www.medicaid.gov/chip/chip-program-information.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\"><u>Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program</u></a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HillaryClinton.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Affordable health care is a basic human right</u></a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501343_pf.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Clinton Claims Credit for Child Program</u></a>, &quot; October 5, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact.com, &quot;Clinton promoted children&#39;s health care,&quot; January 6, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/08/hillary-clinton/standing-up-but-not-alone-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Standing up, but not alone</u></a>,&quot; October 8th, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/hillary-clinton/clinton-promoted-childrens-health-care/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Clinton promoted children&#39;s health care</u></a>,&quot; January 6, 2008</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Hillary Clinton won&nbsp;&quot;health care for 8 million children.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV ad ", "statement_date": "2016-02-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
