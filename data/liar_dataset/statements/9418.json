Eric Cantor in the 7th District Republican primary on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio talk show host, headlined a June 3 rally for Brat at Henrico County&rsquo;s Dominion Club and quickly brought up immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She noted that Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., held a May 28 rally in Richmond and urged Cantor to allow the House to vote on immigration reforms. Cantor, the House majority leader, has blocked votes on a comprehensive immigration bill and an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they&rsquo;ve served.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cantor has signaled, however, that he might support a narrowly drawn bill establishing a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. That&rsquo;s spurred Brat to label Cantor weak on immigration and claim the majority leader is quietly working on a deal with Gutierrez to pass reforms. Brat said Gutierrez&rsquo;s appearance in Virginia was designed to bolster Cantor&rsquo;s credentials as tough on immigration prior to the GOP primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingraham picked up that note, saying the immigration rally was &quot;beautifully choreographed.&quot; She likened Cantor and Gutierrez to a touring &quot;Simon and Garfunkel in the 70s.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingraham said of the two politicians, &quot;They&rsquo;re touring the country last year talking &lsquo;How to Make Life Work&rsquo; -- some ridiculous, meaningless titled tour -- joined at the hip, working together, in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cantor-Gutierrez national immigration tour was news to us. So we looked into Ingraham&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia Hahn, Ingraham&rsquo;s executive producer, said the radio personality was referring to a widely publicized &quot;Becoming America Pilgrimage&quot; held July 25-27, 2013. The <a href=\"http://faithandpolitics.org/galleries/becoming-america-pilgrimage/\"><u>event</u></a>, organized by the non-profit Institute for Faith &amp; Politics, took lawmakers to Ellis Island, the Museum of Jewish Heritage and other sites around New York City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A delegation of about 100 people, including House members, academics and faith leaders, traveled from Washington for the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/immigration-tour-house-leaders-94385.html\"><u>article </u></a>in Politico previewing the New York event said it wasn&rsquo;t &quot;meant to hash out the nitty-gritty of legislation or debate the politics of specific immigration policies. But lawmakers hope it will be small step forward in Congress&rsquo;s effort to enact immigration reform.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gutierrez and Cantor attended parts of the three-day event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cantor spoke at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights in Queens about the &quot;special struggles that Jewish people had arriving in a country that often did not understand or welcome people of his faith and culture,&quot; according to a <a href=\"http://faithandpolitics.org/galleries/becoming-america-pilgrimage/\"><u>synopsis</u></a> of his speech by the Faith &amp; Politics Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hahn pointed to a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/28/Cantor-Jews-Struggled-Like-Immigrants-of-Today\"><u>video</u></a> of part of Cantor&rsquo;s address on the conservative Breitbart.com website. It shows Cantor acknowledging Gutierrez in the audience and saying, &nbsp;&quot;Luis, thank you for the leadership you&rsquo;re providing through thick and thin right now as we try and navigate these very tough political times and choppy waters. My hat is off to you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ray Allen Jr., a Cantor political adviser, said the majority leader&rsquo;s recognition of Gutierrez was a simple courtesy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allen was dismissive of Ingraham&rsquo;s remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, Congressman Cantor did not tour the country with Congressman Gutierrez,&quot; Allen emailed. &quot;No, they had no meetings on immigration and no, they never talked prior to Mr. Gutierrez coming to Richmond to attack Eric Cantor for stopping the Senate&rsquo;s comprehensive immigration plan. And yes, despite what the Left says, we believe it is an amnesty plan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas Rivlin, a spokesman for Gutierrez, said while the Illinois congressman sat in on Cantor&rsquo;s speech in New York, Gutierrez only attended about 12 hours of the three-day immigration pilgrimage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rivlin also said his office checked the congressman&rsquo;s schedule and found Gutierrez &quot;has never once had a meeting with Majority Leader Eric Cantor on any issue, including immigration.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rivlin also said that beyond the &quot;Becoming America Pilgrimage,&quot; he&rsquo;s not aware of any other immigration-related events that Gutierrez and Cantor both attended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Ingraham&rsquo;s executive producer if, beyond the New York event, she could name other immigration functions Cantor and Gutierrez attended. She came up empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingraham said Cantor and Gutierrez were &quot;touring the country last year &hellip; joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cantor and Gutierrez were among 100 leaders who attended a pilgrimage to the New York City area last July that focused on immigration issues. Aides say that&rsquo;s the only immigration event Cantor and Gutierrez both happened to attend and that the two lawmakers have never met to discuss immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One event in New York does not make a national tour. Ingraham can&rsquo;t point to another immigration gig Cantor and Gutierrez both attended. Her likening the two politicians to Simon and Garfunkel &quot;joined at the hip&quot; on a tour to promote immigration reform is not only false, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Ingraham&rsquo;s statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-06T16:29:04.477474", "ruling_date": "2014-06-06T16:24:28", "ruling_headline": "Laura Ingraham says Eric Cantor and Luis Gutierrez \"toured the country\" for immigration reform", "ruling_headline_slug": "laura-ingraham-says-reps-eric-cantor-and-luis-guti", "ruling_link_text": "Tour de farce", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Laura Ingraham&rsquo;s comments at Dave Brat rally, June 3, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Julia Hahn, executive producer of the Laura Ingraham Show, June, 5, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Julia Hahn, June 5, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Douglas Rivlin, spokesman for Rep.
