Even worse to the Fox News gang is how much President Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration is leaning on Sharpton as &quot;a <em>de facto</em> contact and conduit&quot; on race issues, according to a <em>Politico Magazine</em> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/al-sharpton-obama-race-110249.html#ixzz3BhsG8yon\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>profile</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appearing on <em>The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor </em>on the same night as Brown&rsquo;s funeral, Kelly criticized Sharpton for getting ahead of the facts in his fiery speeches to emotional crowds. It was the same segment in which she and O&rsquo;Reilly debated the concept of &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/megyn-kelly-oreilly-clash-over-white-privilege-in-ferguson/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>white privilege</u></a>,&quot; with Kelly presenting several economic, social and educational statistics to show how blacks are disadvantaged in this country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What they don&#39;t need in this case, or in any case, is people like Al Sharpton going in there and declaring as a matter of fact that the, that Michael Brown didn&#39;t use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer,&quot; Kelly said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Reilly said, &quot;Absolutely, that just alienates everybody.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you have somebody come in and prejudge -- someone you trust and rely upon -- come and tell you the facts are one way, you believe him,&quot; Kelly said of Sharpton. &quot;That&#39;s why he is abusing his power.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know if Sharpton flat-out said Brown &quot;didn&rsquo;t use any deadly force&quot; before he was killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happened</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official story of what happened before Brown was shot <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html?smid=tw-share\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>at least six times</u></a> is not entirely known -- a factor driving the unrest against law enforcement. A grand jury is weighing evidence in the case and will decide whether to indict Wilson, and the St. Louis County Police Department and FBI are investigating the shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/08/us/ferguson-brown-timeline/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CNN</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Vox</u></a> have compiled guides to varying accounts from witnesses and law enforcement about what happened. Before noon, there was an alleged strong-arm robbery involving Brown and friend Dorian Johnson at a convenience store. Shortly after, Wilson stopped the men for walking in the middle of a street, without knowing they were suspects in the robbery,<strong> </strong>Ferguson&rsquo;s police chief has said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some witnesses and Brown&rsquo;s advocates say Brown had been shot and was turning around to face Wilson with his hands raised when Wilson fired at him again, hitting his head. Wilson <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/13/5994305/michael-brown-case-investigation-legal-police-kill-force-murder\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>told police</u></a> that Brown assaulted him, pushed him inside of his patrol car, and tried to grab his handgun, and the town&rsquo;s police chief said Wilson sought medical care for his swollen face after the altercation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We won&rsquo;t go into more detail in this fact-check about the various accounts, but we thought it was important to highlight how the narratives conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may never know what really happened, said&nbsp;David Klinger, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of Missouri-St Louis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For anybody who hasn&rsquo;t seen the investigative case file to say that he categorically is confident that it was not possible that Mr. Brown posed a threat to Officer Wilson&rsquo;s life, he is simply wrong,&quot; Klinger said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Sharpton said</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a week before Brown&rsquo;s funeral, Sharpton addressed Ferguson residents at a unity rally. Sharpton says he was invited to town by Brown&rsquo;s grandfather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharpton decried the release of security footage from the convenience store as a post-mortem smear of Brown&rsquo;s character that did nothing to illuminate what happened before he died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But the issue is not whether he shoplifted. The issue is not what he did before,&quot; Sharpton said Aug. 17. &quot;The issue is how a young man with<em> </em>no deadly threat, no life-extenuating circumstances, was shot multiple times. That&rsquo;s the issue, and that&rsquo;s the issue America has got to deal with.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly highlighted this part of his speech in her Aug. 19 edition of <em>The Kelly File </em>and alluded to it on O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s show Aug. 25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sharpton&rsquo;s defense: I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;Walter Cronkite&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharpton defended himself in an interview with PunditFact. He does not deny that he said essentially what Kelly described.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he said his audience knows his point of view and that he was giving his opinion that Brown posed &quot;no deadly threat&quot; because he was unarmed. No one disputes that Brown did not have a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m Walter Cronkite reporting the news,&quot; he said. &quot;That&rsquo;s my opinion, just like they&rsquo;re giving their opinion on white privilege.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shifted his rhetoric a bit when asked about Kelly&rsquo;s specific qualm, saying he believes there is no &quot;apparent&quot; evidence that Brown posed a deadly threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharpton also said, if anything, O&rsquo;Reilly and other Fox News hosts are just as guilty of expressing their viewpoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If (O&rsquo;Reilly) can write books and all of them over there can write books on their opinions, how can you tell me don&rsquo;t go to a rally on my opinion?&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We&rsquo;re all advocates. I use my feet to advocate, they use the pen to advocate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly could not be reached through a Fox spokeswoman or Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In criticizing Sharpton, Kelly said, Sharpton went to Ferguson, Mo., and is &quot;declaring as a matter of fact that ... Michael Brown didn&#39;t use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not exactly what Sharpton said, but it&rsquo;s pretty close. The only possible caveat is Sharpton says he was speaking as a matter of opinion based on what he had so far, more than a matter of fact. That&rsquo;s in the eye of the beholder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly&rsquo;s statement is accurate. We rate it True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-28T17:12:56.879845", "ruling_date": "2014-08-28T17:29:59", "ruling_headline": "Megyn Kelly: Al Sharpton declared Michael Brown 'didn't use any deadly force' against officer", "ruling_headline_slug": "megyn-kelly-al-sharpton-declared-michael-brown-did", "ruling_link_text": "Basically matches Sharpton's remarks", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Al Sharpton, Aug. 26, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with&nbsp;David Klinger, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of Missouri-St Louis, Aug. 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/08/us/ferguson-brown-timeline/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>What happened when Michael Brown met Darren Wilson</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKkbieKkliI#t=255\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Megyn Kelly confronts pastor for reversing Sharpton criticism</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Erik Wemple blog, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/08/26/fox-news-blasts-msnbcs-al-sharpton-for-role-in-ferguson/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Fox News blasts MSNBC&rsquo;s Al Sharpton for role in Ferguson</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 26, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/25/how-al-sharpton-is-using-obama-ferguson-and-msnbc-to-boost-his-influence/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>How Al Sharpton is using Obama, Ferguson and MSNBC to boost his influence</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vox.com card, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/mike-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri/mike-brown-shooting-facts-details\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Why was Michael Brown shot?</u></a>&quot; Aug. 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico Mag<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/al-sharpton-obama-race-110249.html#ixzz3BXDAy5wj\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">azine, &quot;<u>R</u><u>evved Up</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 21, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Journalist", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Megyn", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 2928, "last_name": "Kelly", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "megyn-kelly", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/204_megynkelly_new.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2928/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.nbcnews.com/megyn-kelly"}, "statement": "<p>Al Sharpton went to Ferguson, Mo., and is &quot;declaring as a matter of fact that ...&nbsp;Michael Brown didn&#39;t use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a segment on \"The O'Reilly Factor\"", "statement_date": "2014-08-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 177, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/177/", "subject": "Criminal Justice", "subject_slug": "criminal-justice", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 173, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/173/", "subject": "Public Safety", "subject_slug": "public-safety", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
