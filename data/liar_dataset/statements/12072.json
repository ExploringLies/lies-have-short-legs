John Kasich fell into a common trap while campaigning in his home state of Ohio the day before the primary election. He repeated a famous saying without checking it first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining how he planned to fend off outside interests in his decision-making, the Republican presidential candidate invoked the 33rd president, saying, &quot;You know what Truman said -- &lsquo;You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does sound like one of the folksy, farm-charm quips for which Harry S. Truman is known. He&rsquo;s the leader whose desk displayed the plaque reading, &quot;The buck stops here.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did Truman really say, &quot;You want a friend in Washington, buy a dog?&#39; &quot;&nbsp;Or is it a myth that solidified through repetition, like a thousand witticisms wrongly attributed to <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/paradox.asp\">George Carlin</a> in email chains?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://http://bit.ly/politifactgive\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px; text-align: center;\"><strong>PITCH IN&nbsp;$1, HELP POLITIFACT GET $15,000 IN MATCHING FUNDS TO HIRE A FACT-CHECKER</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The definitive information comes from the historians at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum. Sam Rushay, supervisory archivist, told us, &quot;We have never been able to confirm or verify that President Truman ever wrote or said, &lsquo;If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,&rsquo; a quote that is often attributed to him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most <a href=\"http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/23/washington-dog-truman/\">often cited</a> source for the non-quote is from a work of fiction. In the play <em>Give &lsquo;em Hell, Harry</em>, written by Samuel Gallu in 1975, Truman&rsquo;s character says, &quot;You want a friend in life, get a dog!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.solomonscandals.com/truman-nonquote-if-you-want-a-friend-get-a-dog-as-used-by-corporate-raider-carl-icahn/\">Previous</a> <a href=\"http://www.teleread.com/google-book-search-harry-s-truman-and-the-get-a-dog-quote-presidential-library-unable-to-confirm-it/\">investigators </a>have found the mistake in a 1987 op-ed in the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/07/business/prospects.html\">New York Times</a></em>, and in a 1989 column by the <em>New York Times&rsquo;</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/10/us/bush-s-fierce-loyalty-raises-debate-on-whether-it-hinders-his-judgment.html\">Maureen Dowd.</a> In both cases, the writers credited the quote to the real Truman, and substituted the word &quot;Washington&quot; for &quot;life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History proves that Truman was no fan of dogs.
