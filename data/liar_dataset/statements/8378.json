Louie Gohmert of Tyler as among a couple dozen &quot;unhinged&quot; House Republicans keeping the government from being funded unless the Obamacare law is unplugged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collins wrote that this cast includes Gohmert, who had an &quot;exciting time&quot; with Republican Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Michele Bachmann of Minnesota &quot;in Egypt on a recent fact-finding tour during which ... Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Collins&rsquo; research aide, Isabella Moschen, pointed us to a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/world/middleeast/three-us-lawmakers-visit-egypt-to-praise-crackdown.html?_r=0\"><u>news article</u></a> posted online Sept. 8, 2013, describing a Cairo news conference featuring Bachmann, King and Gohmert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Times</em> story said Gohmert &quot;compared the leader of the military takeover, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visiting Americans vowed to defend the $1.3 billion in annual American military aid to Egypt, according to the story, so its army could continue its fight against what Gohmert called &quot;the bloodthirsty Muslim brothers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stand strong, Egypt,&quot; Gohmert was quoted as saying. &quot;Stand firm.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked Gohmert&rsquo;s wording by watching a 15-minute YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0iTiCHjiNs\"><u>video</u></a> of part of the press conference. Here&rsquo;s the relevant quote by Gohmert from the video: &quot;George Washington, doing what no one had ever done before him, led a military in revolution, won the revolution and then resigned and went home. No one had ever done that. And we met in Gen. el-Sisi, a man who&rsquo;s the leader of the military, who might have a shot at being elected president, but who&rsquo;s more concerned about giving his life to help his country, Egypt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Gohmert did liken el-Sisi&rsquo;s situation to that of Washington after his Revolutionary War victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collins said Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge in Egypt to George Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gohmert linked the Egyptian general and Washington. But this statement could benefit from the clarification that Gohmert&rsquo;s comparison was limited to each figure&rsquo;s desire to put his country ahead of himself; he did not compare other aspects of their characters or achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim, which would have benefited from clarification, as Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-09T16:09:28.260963", "ruling_date": "2013-10-10T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Louie Gohmert linked George Washington and Egyptian general", "ruling_headline_slug": "louie-gohmert-linked-george-washington-and-egyptia", "ruling_link_text": "Likened moments", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IU6ehnR800PlMbePWO_PE6ucUXYKN4ZjjzQQXTkWX_8/pub\"><u>Emails</u></a>, Isabella Moschen, researcher for Gail Collins, oped columnist, the <em>New York Times</em>, Oct. 4, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/world/middleeast/three-us-lawmakers-visit-egypt-to-praise-crackdown.html?_r=0\"><u>&quot;Visiting Republicans Laud Egypt&rsquo;s Force,&quot;</u></a> <em>New York Times</em>, Sept. 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0iTiCHjiNs\"><u>&quot;Bachmann, Steve King and Louie Gohmert,SUPPORTING THE OVER THROW OF MORSI A RADICAL MUSLIM,&quot;</u></a> posted on YouTube by Leonida Sheets, Sept. 7, 2013 (viewed on Oct. 4, 2013)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Columnist for the New York Times", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Gail ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1067, "last_name": "Collins", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "gail-collins", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 64, "party": "Journalist", "party_slug": "journalist", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/64/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gailcollins.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1067/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/gailcollins/index.html"}, "statement": "<p>Louie Gohmert of Texas &quot;compared the current general-in-charge in Egypt to George Washington.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "her oped column", "statement_date": "2013-10-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. House member", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Louie", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 932, "last_name": "Gohmert", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "louie-gohmert", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gohmert2008.jpeg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/932/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.gohmert.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
