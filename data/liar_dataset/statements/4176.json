What&rsquo;s worse, they said, it puts their citizens at risk of harassment by U.S. law enforcement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot so fast, Olens said in a radio story aired June 28. &nbsp;Mexico has little right to complain in light of its own immigration laws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you&#39;re from Guatemala and you are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed,&quot; Olens told AM 750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB. &quot;But here we have both Guatemala and Mexico complaining that we have laws to discourage illegal immigrants in our country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIllegal Guatemalans are &quot;automatically jailed&quot; if they&rsquo;re discovered in Mexico? Sounds harsh for a nation that&rsquo;s complaining about Georgia&rsquo;s law. We decided to check this out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia&rsquo;s House Bill 87 aims to crack down on illegal immigration in this state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of its more controversial provisions would give police the authority to investigate the immigration status of people who they believe have committed crimes and who cannot produce identification. Another would punish people who, while committing another offense, knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants or encourage them to come here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast month, a U.S. district judge temporarily stopped these provisions from going into effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted Olens spokeswoman Lauren Kane, who said that Olens&rsquo; claim was incorrect and he will not repeat it in the future. She said in an email that he was unaware Mexico had changed its immigration law a few years ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen, violating Mexico immigration law was a criminal offense. Now it isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMexico has tried to improve conditions for migrants, although human rights advocates say these efforts aren&rsquo;t enough. In 2008, reforms decriminalized immigration violations, said Andrew Selee, who directs the Mexico Institute, a research and policy center at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMerely being present in Mexico without papers is a civil violation, not a criminal one, experts told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tViolators are not arrested or put in jail, which is designated for criminals or those suspected of crimes. They are sent to detention facilities and undergo a separate administrative process.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIllegal migrants may, if they choose, be deported within 48 hours and avoid a criminal record. If they contest their deportation, their stay in detention is much longer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislation signed in May by Mexican President Felipe Calderon aims to improve conditions further, said Amnesty International researcher Rupert Knox, who is an expert on Mexico. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new legislation reaffirms that people who cross the border into Mexico without papers are guilty of a civil offense, not a criminal one, according to Knox and news reports. It emphasizes they have a right to health care and education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt also draws tighter restrictions on who can detain illegal migrants. Before the May legislation, Mexican police could detain an illegal migrant and hand him over to national immigration authorities for deportation. Now, only those detected by national immigration authorities can be sent for deportation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMexican police are not allowed to stop people on the suspicion that they are in the country illegally, Knox said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn sum, Guatemalans found illegally in Mexico are not &quot;automatically jailed,&quot; as Olens said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince immigration violations are not criminal offenses, irregular migrants who are discovered are sent to a noncriminal detention facility, not jail. Their cases are not handled by the criminal courts, but by a separate administrative system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, if a Mexican police officer detects an illegal migrant, he cannot detain him for deportation. Only immigration authorities can do that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Olens&rsquo; spokeswoman acknowledged, he&rsquo;s wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOlens earns a False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-25T13:29:54.825213", "ruling_date": "2011-07-26T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Olens accuses Mexico of having harsher immigration laws than Georgia", "ruling_headline_slug": "olens-accuses-mexico-having-own-harsh-immigration-", "ruling_link_text": "Incorrecto", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAM 750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsbradio.com/news/news/local/six-illiegal-immigrants-arrested-atlanta-rally/nC2KH/\">Six Illegal Immigrants Arrested at Atlanta Rally</a>,&quot; June 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLos Angeles Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-migrants-20110528,0,7733401.story\">Mexico law aims to reduce risks to migrants passing through</a>,&quot; &nbsp;May 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmnesty International, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR41/014/2010\">Invisible Victims: Migrants on the Move in Mexico</a>,&quot; April 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAFP, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gSi-pbDB2fb3ZIlv0kabfENPpevA?docId=CNG.375660d1c22904b19bcc3d605e38cda1.a1\">Mexico lawmakers vote to protect undocumented migrants</a>,&quot; April 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/world/5741624.html\">Mexican Congress approves end to criminal penalties for undocumented migrants</a>,&quot; April 30, 2008</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUSA Today, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-05-25-mexico-migrants_N.htm\">Activists blast Mexico&rsquo;s immigration law</a>,&quot; May 25, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/new-georgia-law-targeting-993639.html\">Immigration law takes effect today</a>,&quot; July 1, 2011,<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, et al. v.
