Andrew M. Cuomo touts New York state as a progressive beacon for the rest of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, says that&rsquo;s not true when it comes to recreational marijuana. It&rsquo;s not legal in New York state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo was asked about the issue during a recent exchange with reporters on Long Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Given what&rsquo;s happened in Massachusetts, California, what could happen in New Jersey, do you feel as if New York is behind on this at all?&quot; NY1 Reporter Zack Fink asked Cuomo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, I think we&rsquo;re actually ahead on it,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;We announced months ago that we were going to study the legalization issue precisely for that reason. You have Massachusetts, you have New Jersey talking about it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, Cuomo asked the state Department of Health to study what legalizing marijuana would mean for New York state. The study will <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/04/11/nixon-on-legalizing-marijuana-a-key-front-in-racist-war-on-drugs-359604\">reportedly</a> be finished this fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some states have already legalized marijuana for recreational use. So, what was Cuomo talking about when he said &quot;we&rsquo;re actually ahead on it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Cuomo was saying</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo did not mean to say New York state was ahead of other states that already legalized recreational marijuana, a spokesperson said. He meant that the&nbsp;Department of Health study would put New York state ahead of others in responding to the federal government&#39;s new position on state marijuana laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href=\"http://Sessions nixes Obama-era rules leaving states alone that legalize pot\">rescinded</a> an Obama-era rule earlier this year that allowed states to legalize marijuana without federal interference. States with legal marijuana have mostly shrugged off the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Context matters here. A reporter asked Cuomo if New York state was falling behind states that already legalized recreational marijuana. Cuomo said&nbsp;New York state was not, and his full response makes little mention of the federal position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>States with legal marijuana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state legislature in Vermont recently voted to make recreational marijuana legal later this year. The other states legalized recreational use through ballot referendums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Jersey and Michigan may be next. New Jersedy Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, supports legalization and <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/marijuana/2018/03/murphy_wants_legal_weed_in_nj_by_end_of_year.html\">wants</a> lawmakers to approve a bill this year. Advocates in Michigan have gathered <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/marijuana-legalization-2018-which-states-will-consider-cannabis-laws-year-755282\">enough</a> signatures to put legalization on the ballot in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state, however, is taking steps toward legalization that other states have not. The study from the state Department of Health leaves the option for legalization on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New York state marijuana laws</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo has been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/02/cuomo-says-he-remains-opposed-to-recreational-marijuana-109436\">opposed</a> to legalizing recreational marijuana. He has called it a &quot;gateway drug.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he supports decriminalizing marijuana -- ending criminal penalties for possessing and using small amounts of the drug. Selling it would still carry a penalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state legalized marijuana for medicinal use in 2014. The state&rsquo;s program has <a href=\"https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/01/10/new-york-medical-marijuana-program-continues-to-grow\">expanded</a> since its inception, allowing more conditions to be treated with the drug and wider access statewide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo said New York state is ahead of other states on legalizing marijuana for recreational use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not true. Nine other states have already legalized recreational marijuana. Other states have also taken steps toward legalization that New York state has not. New Jersey&rsquo;s governor has called on the legislature to legalize the drug, while voters in Michigan are <a href=\"https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan-lawmakers-consider-legalizing-medical-marijuana-before-november-ballot\">expected</a> to decide on legalization later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-13T11:50:19.079211", "ruling_date": "2018-04-17T16:46:47", "ruling_headline": "Cuomo says New York state is ahead of others on recreational marijuana, but it isn't", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuomo-says-new-york-state-ahead-others-recreationa", "ruling_link_text": "Nine other states ahead of NY", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email conversation with Richard Azzopardi, spokesperson for Cuomo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone conversation with Abbey Fashouer, spokesperson for Cuomo</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn69WKYtLWk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Cynthia Nixon video supporting recreational marijuana</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/02/cuomo-says-he-remains-opposed-to-recreational-marijuana-109436\">Cuomo says he remains opposed to recreational marijuana</a>,&quot; POLITICO New York, Feb. 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1\">This map shows every state that has legalized marijuana</a>,&quot; Business Insider, Jan. 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html\">State Marijuana Laws in 2018 Map</a>,&quot; Governing Magazine, March 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.silive.com/news/2018/02/legal_marijuana_laws_by_state_2018.html\">Marijuana laws by state: Where is weed legal in 2018?</a>,&quot; SILive.com, Feb. 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://whyy.org/segments/murphy-move-to-legalize-recreational-pot-gets-fractured-response-from-n-j-delegation/\">Murphy move to legalize recreational pot gets fractured response from N.J. delegation</a>,&quot; WHYY, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/27/us/marijuana-legalization-timeline.html#/#time283_8117\">Milestones in U.S. Marijuana Laws</a>,&quot; New York Times, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/2017/01/gov_cuomo_proposes_decriminalizing_marijuana.html\">Gov.
