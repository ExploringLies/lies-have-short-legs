Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis), a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBNJv0bw2I&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> uploaded Feb. 1, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Sanfelippo spoke, a graphic behind him caught our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It claimed that &quot;Over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Repeat offenders</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To check the claim, we turned first to an official report on recidivism published by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in September 2016. It tracks whether inmates are sentenced for a new crime after they are released from prison for an earlier offense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://doc.wi.gov/Documents/WEB/ABOUT/DATARESEARCH/Recidivism%20After%20Release%20from%20Prison%20(August%202016).pdf\">report</a> shows recidivism trends covering more than 156,000 offenders who were released from the Wisconsin correctional system between 1990 and 2013, Corrections Secretary Jon E. Litscher wrote in an introduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quick takeaway: Since the early 1990s, the percentage of inmates who are convicted of a new crime within three years of getting out of prison has fallen steadily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the category of &quot;violent&quot; criminals, the Department of Corrections looked at those convicted of murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, negligent manslaughter, kidnapping, other sexual assault, simple assault, and other violent offenses including intimidation, illegal abortion, extortion, cruelty toward a child or wife and hit-and-run driving with bodily injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violent crimes do not include aggravated burglary or burglary, DOC spokesman Tristan Cook told us. The standards come from the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) Performance-Based Measures System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who committed violent crimes -- the group Sanfelippo is interested in -- 27.2% were considered recidivists, according to the latest state report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So does that mean Sanfelippo is way off target by saying &quot;over 39% return to prison?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not necessarily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a wrinkle here related to the definition of &quot;recidivism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the definition used in the report, recidivism means those who are convicted and sentenced for a new crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves out a whole category of offenders who return to prison without being convicted of a new crime. Typically they land in prison when their probation, parole or extended supervision is revoked by the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you factor in those cases, the rate was <a href=\"http://doc.wi.gov/Documents/WEB/ABOUT/DATARESEARCH/WI-DOC-Reincarceration-Rates.pdf\">39.7% in the most recent figures</a>, according to the state Department of Corrections. It&rsquo;s that calculation that Sanfelippo points to in backing up his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state calls that the &quot;reincarceration rate.&quot; It&rsquo;s a commonly used measurement in incarceration research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Sanfelippo&rsquo;s phrasing in the video squares with that data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another factor</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is one issue with his approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanfelippo portrays these repeat violent offenders as &quot;terrorizing our neighborhoods,&quot; but many who are sent back due to parole violations and related matters have done something that does not warrant a new criminal charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violent offenders are returned quite frequently for technical violations, in part because they are under more stringent supervision due to the serious nature of their offenses, said Thomas LeBel, a criminal justice expert at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/no-new-conviction-but-sent-back-to-prison-b99420782z1-288939871.html\">A Journal Sentinel investigation</a> published in 2015 found the process that sends violators back behind bars relies largely on the judgment of individual parole agents, which can vary widely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the reincarcerated, more than half were imprisoned when their probation, parole or extended supervision was revoked, with no new conviction and sentencing, Corrections Department statistics show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those types of cases, there was suspected criminal activity in a<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2016/12/13/3000-sent-prison-without-new-convictions-2015/95196324/\">bout 70% of cases involving some 3,000 ex-offenders</a> sent back to prison <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/no-new-conviction-but-sent-back-to-prison-b99420782z1-288939871.html\">without being convicted of new crimes</a> in 2015, Corrections Department statistics show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But technical violations are a factor too. They can include things such as accepting a job without permission, missing a meeting with a probation or parole officer, or leaving their home counties, according to a study by <a href=\"http://www.rocwisconsin.org/\">WISDOM</a>, a statewide group of faith leaders and activists dedicated to prison reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, some can wind up back in prison even if acquitted of charges in court. In February 2017, the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2017/02/04/man-not-guilty-gun-charges-trial-but-still-sent-prison-wisconsin/97359244/\">Journal Sentinel wrote about Damien Payne</a>, a Milwaukee man on state supervision after release from prison in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payne was found not guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of carrying a concealed weapon, but still was sent to prison for more than three years. A Corrections Department rule allows that action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanfelippo claimed that &quot;over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number tracks a credible report by the state, so it&rsquo;s on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it needs clarification because Sanfelippo portrays the repeat offenders as &quot;terrorizing&quot; neighborhoods when some very likely were imprisoned anew for lesser violations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s our definition of Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\">\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">Politifact</a></div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com/mediapage/jpgs/politifact-logo-big.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">1</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">6</div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-mostlytrue.jpg\" style=\"display:none\" /> Politifact Rating:\r\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\">http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/10/joe-sanfelippo/joe-sanfelippo-39-percent-violent-criminals-return/</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Joe Sanfelippo</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Wisconsin state representative, D-West Allis</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<img src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/Sanfelippo_Joe_PFACT.jpg\" style=\"display:none\" />\r\n<div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\">In a video</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Wednesday, February 1, 2017</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">02/01/2017</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/10/joe-sanfelippo/joe-sanfelippo-39-percent-violent-criminals-return/\">Read More</a>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right\"><a href=\"#\">info</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-08T16:16:59.296676", "ruling_date": "2017-02-10T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Joe Sanfelippo: 39 percent of violent criminals return to prison following their release", "ruling_headline_slug": "joe-sanfelippo-39-percent-violent-criminals-return", "ruling_link_text": "For new crimes or violations of supervised release", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>State Rep.
