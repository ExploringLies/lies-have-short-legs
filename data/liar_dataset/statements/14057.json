To the extent we know anything about Trump&rsquo;s personal tax situation, experts said she is basically correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What we know about Trump&rsquo;s taxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is the first presidential candidate, and the first president, in decades <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/28/tammy-baldwin/donald-trump-only-major-party-nominee-40-years-not/\">not to release his tax returns</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two portions of Trump&rsquo;s tax returns have been leaked to the media. One consists of summary pages from state tax returns from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;_r=0\">1995</a>, which were sent anonymously to the <em>New York Times</em> last fall. However, because these are state -- not federal -- tax documents, they don&rsquo;t shed much light on Pelosi&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second forms are the summary pages from his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/14/us/politics/document-Donald-Trump-2005-Tax.html\">2005 federal tax return</a>, which were first reported in March by MSNBC&rsquo;s Rachel Maddow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2005 returns suggest that Pelosi is in the ballpark, judging by the alternative minimum tax alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/upshot/winners-and-losers-in-the-trump-tax-plan.html\">eliminate the alternative minimum tax</a>, or AMT, which is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A line in Trump&rsquo;s 2005 tax return shows that Trump paid $31,261,179 that year for the AMT. That was a large portion of his total tax bill: Had it not been for the AMT, Trump would have owed only about $5.3 million in federal taxes that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some room for questions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Pelosi&rsquo;s office, a spokesman provided two analyses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, by Pelosi&rsquo;s own staff, cited the AMT line from his 2005 report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other analysis, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3680332-4-26-17-Tax-Reform-TP.html\">published by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee on April 26</a>, said that Trump would save about $28.6 million mostly through the reduction of the &quot;pass-through income&quot; rate to 15 percent. (&quot;Pass-through income&quot; involves a certain type of structuring for business and personal income taxes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given these two projections, &quot;we decided to go with an average of $30 million,&quot; said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several tax experts said that $30 million is a reasonable estimate, given what we know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In round numbers, Pelosi&#39;s assertion is correct,&quot; said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several experts added, however, that the combination of Trump&rsquo;s lack of transparency about his own taxes and the lack of detail he&rsquo;s offered so far in his tax proposal provide a lot of room for uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, in future years, Trump&rsquo;s taxes may be more reliant on the lower, 15 percent tax on pass-through income than the AMT, said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor whose specialties include taxation. But we don&rsquo;t know exactly how that would change the equation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&#39;t really have enough detail from Trump&#39;s tax returns to properly analyze the impact of reforms,&quot; said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. &quot;And even the reform plan is not so much a plan but a high level of general objectives.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then again, if Trump wants to complain about an incorrect estimate of his tax burden, all he has to do is release his tax returns, Shaviro said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi said, &quot;The &lsquo;tax plan&rsquo; rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts agree that $30 million is a reasonable estimate, given the limited information available, both in Trump&rsquo;s public tax returns and the bullet-point nature of his tax-policy proposal. Still, it is an estimate, so the actual number may be quite a bit lower or higher. We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-28T14:49:04.308935", "ruling_date": "2017-04-28T15:26:44", "ruling_headline": "Nancy Pelosi on target about what Donald Trump might save under his tax plan", "ruling_headline_slug": "nancy-pelosi-target-about-what-donald-trump-might-", "ruling_link_text": "Reasonable estimate, given limited info", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Nancy Pelosi, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/857613272350167041\">tweet</a>, April 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/14/us/politics/document-Donald-Trump-2005-Tax.html\">Donald Trump&rsquo;s Tax Documents from 2005</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;_r=0&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=CA4BD338E0BB1499E0B120BCCAB79CDA&amp;gwt=pay\">Donald Trump&rsquo;s Tax Documents from 1995</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Ways and Means Committee Democratic staff, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3680332-4-26-17-Tax-Reform-TP.html\">memo</a>, April 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/upshot/winners-and-losers-in-the-trump-tax-plan.html\">Winners and Losers in the Trump Tax Plan</a>,&quot; April 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/28/tammy-baldwin/donald-trump-only-major-party-nominee-40-years-not/\">Is Donald Trump the only major-party nominee in 40 years not to release his tax returns?</a>&quot; Sep. 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Roberton Williams, fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, April 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Daniel Shaviro, New York University law professor, April 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida, April 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Drew Hammill, spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, April 28, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "House Minority Leader", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Nancy ", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "California", "id": 59, "last_name": "Pelosi", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "nancy-pelosi", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-nancypelosi.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/59/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The &lsquo;tax plan&rsquo; rolled out by @realDonaldTrump would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005 (the only year we have returns for).&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2017-04-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "Nancy Pelosi on target about what Donald Trump might save under his tax plan"}
