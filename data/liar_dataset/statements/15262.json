Greitens, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/eric-greitens/\">a combat veteran and a Republican</a>, was elected governor in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How Greitens behaved during the affair, and especially whether he had specific sexual interactions with the woman without her consent, have become key points of dispute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An April 8 <a href=\"https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/\">headline</a> on the Sentinel, a website that writes about government in Missouri, said that his accuser &quot;admits photo session may have been a dream.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found news reports show the woman did make this statement in a deposition, but the Sentinel omitted a complete explanation about the woman&rsquo;s testimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sentinel quoted from a few paragraphs in a defense motion filed on behalf of Greitens April 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the defense counsel asked the woman, &quot;Did you ever see (Greitens) in possession of a camera or phone?&quot; she answered: &quot;Not to my knowledge. I didn&rsquo;t see him with it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An assistant circuit attorney asked the woman, &quot;Did you see what you believed to be a phone?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She answered, &quot;&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t talked about it because I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m remembering it through a dream or I &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven&rsquo;t spoken about it because of that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jack Cashill, co-editor of the Sentinel, told PolitiFact that he didn&rsquo;t have the full deposition and relied on excerpts in the court filing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It is for this reason I used the subjunctive in the headline &lsquo;may have,&rsquo; &quot; he said, noting that other news outlets including the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5594855/Greitens-attorneys-cast-doubt-womans-recollections.html\">Daily Mail</a> used a similar approach in headlines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGreitens has seized on the dream portion of the woman&rsquo;s statement, telling media that the case is &quot;a political witch hunt now based on the testimony of somebody who said under oath that they may be remembering this through a dream.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other news reports state that that the woman&rsquo;s testimony came during a deposition that lasted for several hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Associated Press wrote that &quot;the prosecutor in the case says the defense &lsquo;cherry picked bits and pieces&rsquo; of her nine-hour deposition and the woman&#39;s attorney says the comment referred to one particular instance concerning the photo.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.house.mo.gov/Billtracking/bills181/commit/rpt1840/Special%20Investigative%20Committee%20on%20Oversight%20Report.pdf\">Missouri House committee investigation</a> into the allegations against Greitens also mentioned the dream comment, but stated in a footnote that the committee &quot;includes these quotes in the absence of a full transcript from the deposition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman told the committee that during an encounter with Greitens, &quot;I can hear like a, like a cell phone &ndash; like a picture, and I can see a flash through the blindfold.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The committee concluded that the woman was a credible witness. Greitens did not testify before the House committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison issued a gag order in the case which prohibits comments related to the deposition and requires the judge to sign off on certain court filings before they&#39;re made public. Without the deposition, we can&rsquo;t fully evaluate the woman&rsquo;s comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman&rsquo;s attorney, Scott Simpson, said in <a href=\"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/29/529b7753-1336-5546-beb5-786549b6d3b1/5acceb7843cca.pdf.pdf\">statement to media</a> that the woman supports the release of the full transcript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simpson said that Greitens &quot;has admitted to my client, on multiple occasions that he took her photograph without her consent, and threatened to release it if she ever told anyone about their relationship.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline by the Sentinel website said that &quot;Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a &lsquo;dream.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News articles state that the woman made that comment during a lengthy deposition. Since we don&rsquo;t have a transcript of the deposition, it is difficult to evaluate her comment but it appears to be cherry-picking from a deposition that lasted several hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-12T16:02:14.423513", "ruling_date": "2018-04-13T13:44:27", "ruling_headline": "Did accuser in Eric Greitens sex case say photo may have been a dream?", "ruling_headline_slug": "headline-about-greitens-accuser-sex-case-doesn", "ruling_link_text": "50 shades of truth?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Sentinel,<a href=\"https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/\"> &quot;Breaking: Greitens Accuser Admits Photo Session May Have Been A &lsquo;Dream,&rsquo;&quot; </a>April 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Missouri House Special Investigative Committee on Oversight, <a href=\"https://www.house.mo.gov/Billtracking/bills181/commit/rpt1840/Special%20Investigative%20Committee%20on%20Oversight%20Report.pdf\">Report</a>, April 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawyer Scott Simpson, <a href=\"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/29/529b7753-1336-5546-beb5-786549b6d3b1/5acceb7843cca.pdf.pdf\">Statement about Greitens case</a>, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, <a href=\"https://www.mscnews.net/news/?nk=64566\">&quot;Report: Missouri Gov.
