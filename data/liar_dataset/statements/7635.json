High school students can it take a second or third time, if necessary, to demonstrate that they have learned enough for a diploma.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMancuso said it was important to note that &quot;the second and third NECAP test that&#39;s given is not the same NECAP test that they&#39;re given originally. . . . You know those really hard questions that are on the front page of the paper that we all look at and say, &#39;Oh my goodness, how could anybody pass these?&#39; Those are there to weed out and to show what our excellent students are doing. So when the test is re-given to the kids the second and third time, those [harder] questions are taken out.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe were under the impression that students who had to re-take the NECAP test to demonstrate proficiency didn&#39;t take a less-challenging form of the test, so we decided to check her statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMancuso&#39;s office sent us to her spokesman, Mike Trainor. While we were waiting for his response, we contacted Elliot Krieger, spokesman at the Rhode Island Department Education.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKrieger said although questions on the NECAP change from year to year -- as they do for most standardized tests -- the test is not dumbed-down if students need to retake it in the beginning of their senior year. It&#39;s the same NECAP test high school juniors are taking.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut seniors who fail to show enough improvement on the second test and need to take a third will be given a stripped-down version of the NECAP, a version that is still under development. &quot;It will be a shorter version, have less degree of difficulty because it&#39;s single purpose will be to determine whether students at the low-scoring level have shown improvement,&quot; said Krieger. &quot;There may be some difficult questions, but they will be fewer.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We haven&#39;t designed it yet. It&#39;s more than a year away. But that&#39;s the plan,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen Trainor got back to us, he said Krieger had the correct information and Mancuso supports that.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRhode Island Board of Education Chairwoman Eva Marie Mancuso said, &quot;When the [NECAP proficiency] test is re-given to the kids the second and third time, those [harder] questions are taken out.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeniors who retake the NECAP should find that the second test is just as difficult as the first because it&#39;s the same test that juniors are taking.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s only in the third test, given to seniors who fail the second, that the number of questions will be fewer and harder questions -- ones designed for more advanced students -- will be removed. At least, that&#39;s the plan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause her statement is only partially accurate, we rate it<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> Half True</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
