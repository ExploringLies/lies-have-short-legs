Scott Walker&rsquo;s move to curtail collective bargaining.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When we were in Illinois, we learned that Abraham Lincoln had jumped out of a window in the Illinois Legislature in order to deny a quorum,&quot; Miller said. &quot;So we felt like in that case we were definitely in good company.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrying to deny a quorum -- that does sound familiar.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is that fact or just a Lincoln legend?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome of the details we heard caused us to wonder.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany accounts, even in some well-regarded Lincoln biographies, claim Lincoln jumped from the second story. Now, we are well aware of the lanky Lincoln&rsquo;s length, but, really, wouldn&rsquo;t injury have been the result of such a leap? No injury was reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd many accounts refer to Lincoln jumping from the state Capitol building that day, Dec. 5, 1840. But historians note the new Capitol would not open until days later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what&rsquo;s the truth?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found numerous book and <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Lincolndaybyday.pdf\">newspaper </a><a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Lincolndaybyday.pdf\">references </a>to <a href=\"http://blogs.sj-r.com/alo/index.php/2011/03/01/are-wisconsin-democratic-senators-taking-their-guidance-from-abe/\">Lincoln&rsquo;s desperate </a><a href=\"http://blogs.sj-r.com/alo/index.php/2011/03/01/are-wisconsin-democratic-senators-taking-their-guidance-from-abe/\">attempt </a>to block a vote on a banking bill, including an account in Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer David Herbert Donald&rsquo;s &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1995).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLincoln, an advocate of a strong central banking system, was trying to save the state bank of Illinois.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDonald called it a &quot;second story&quot; job at the Capitol building.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLincoln himself later made a brief speech about his &quot;jumping scrape&quot; when the Legislature reconvened in January 1841, historians say, citing legislative documents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe located the <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Illinois+state+reg.pdf\">Illinois State Register&rsquo;s </a><a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Illinois+state+reg.pdf\">account </a>of that day in the Legislature. The Springfield newspaper&rsquo;s correspondent said Lincoln &quot;unceremoniously raised a window&quot; and jumped through. His account ran on Dec. 11, 1840 -- less than a week after the incident itself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we found no real dispute on the outline of what happened.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s settle some details.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the co-author of one of the books Donald, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/books/19donald.html\">who died in 2009</a>, cited for his account: Wayne Temple, chief deputy director of the Illinois State Archives in Springfield. Temple&rsquo;s book is, &quot;Illinois&rsquo; Fifth Capitol: the House That Lincoln Built and Caused to Be Rebuilt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTemple has personally sifted through the newspaper accounts and legislative minutes from the 1840 session.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt happened, Temple told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That&rsquo;s the story, and I&rsquo;ve done it from primary sources.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe episode actually took place at a church serving as temporary legislative chambers, he said. The new capitol building wouldn&rsquo;t open for the Illinois House until two days later. How does Temple know? &quot;I have records to show which church got paid,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTour guides at the Capitol sometimes have wrongly told visitors that Lincoln jumped from there, Temple said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If he had jumped out of there he would have killed himself,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis &quot;escape,&quot; Temple said, was from the first floor, not the second.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLincoln and his Whig Party colleagues had already been tallied as present and voting before they opened the window and jumped out, numerous accounts show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Lincoln may have been trying to block a quorum, but he failed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It was for naught!&quot; Temple said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Donald&rsquo;s account, the Whigs were absent for many hours, leaving Lincoln and a few lieutenants behind to watch the proceedings. But they made a procedural blunder, necessitating their quick exit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats ridiculed Lincoln and his &quot;flying brethren,&quot; Donald wrote, noting that &quot;his celebrated leap caused him no harm because his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senators in the &quot;Wisconsin 14&quot; ultimately failed to stop a vote, too, but they stayed away for 22 days, allowing massive protests to develop in Madison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Lincoln didn&rsquo;t leave the state -- he didn&rsquo;t even leave the square,&quot; Temple told us. &quot;The sergeant of arms could have gotten him by the nape of the neck and dragged him back.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin has seen its share of quorum-escaping moves over the years, according to a <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_f6bded18-3b0a-11e0-b028-001cc4c03286.html\">colorful historical account in the Wisconsin State Journal</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne episode, the paper reported, involved state Rep. Ruth Doyle, mother of former Gov. Jim Doyle, refusing to leave the &quot;ladies powder room&quot; where she fled to avoid voting on a resolution asking Gen. Douglas MacArthur to address the state Legislature about the &quot;appeasement of Communists in our own nation and the world.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s bring this back to the present.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the summer of 2011, recall elections for state senators will help write history&rsquo;s view of the tumultuous battle over collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin. It&rsquo;s premature to predict the outcome now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let history record that media accounts in 2011 properly recorded that Abe Lincoln and the Whigs did try to block a quorum in 1840 by staying away. And the future president did leave through a window.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was a botched attempt, and therefore is a poor comparison to the Wisconsin episode in February 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Miller heard it right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHonest Abe, and a True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-26T17:37:53.572960", "ruling_date": "2011-05-30T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller says Abe Lincoln jumped out of a window to deny a quorum", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-senate-minority-leader-mark-miller-says-", "ruling_link_text": "The records are dusty, but clear", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Mark Miller, Senate minority leader, May 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Marilyn Lynch, archivist, The State Journal-Register, May 20-21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Wayne Temple, chief deputy director of the Illinois State Archives in Springfield, May 20, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIllinois State Register archives for December 11, 1840<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBook by David Herbert Donald, &quot;Lincoln&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBook, &quot;Lincoln Day by Day, A Chronology, 1809-1865,&quot; Earl Schenck Miers, editor in chief<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Abraham Lincoln Observer, &quot;Are Wisconsin Democratic Senators taking their guidance from Abe?&quot; March 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Bob Moore, library assistant, Lincoln Library, Springfield&rsquo;s Public Library, May 23, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "State Senator, District 16", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Mark", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 1235, "last_name": "Miller", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "mark-miller", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/State_Sen._Mark_Miller.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1235/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=senate&district=16"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Abraham Lincoln (once) jumped out of a window in the Illinois Legislature in order to deny a quorum.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "statement_context": "remarks to reporters", "statement_date": "2011-05-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 192, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/192/", "subject": "Labor", "subject_slug": "labor", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
