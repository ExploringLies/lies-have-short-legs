Raheel Sharif</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCain was part of a bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee delegation with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Sen. Benjamin Sasse, R.-Neb., and Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was billed as an effort to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-usa-idUSKCN0ZJ0OL\">strengthen relations</a> between the two countries and defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While ISIS does not have a major presence in Pakistan, the United States has <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/lahore-bombing-fuels-fears-isis-foothold-pakistan-n547411\">expressed concern</a>&nbsp;over indirect connections between the terror group and Pakistani militants. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the meeting,&nbsp;McCain emphasized that Pakistan needs to do more to take on terrorist groups, such as the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/afghanistan/institute-study-war-haqqani-network/p26126\">Haqqani Network</a>, an insurgency group with ties to al-Qaeda and Pakistan, that threaten America, according to his spokeswoman. She also said McCain&rsquo;s visit was within his oversight as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the point of the delegation&#39;s visit was not to make a deal on aircrafts &mdash; especially since Congress <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-planes-idUSKCN0XT1U6\">had balked at a military proposal</a> for the United States to finance eight&nbsp;fighter jets for Pakistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stumbling block: Pakistan&#39;s terrorism&nbsp;ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sen. McCain conveyed to Pakistani leaders that U.S. financing for those (F-16) aircrafts will not be supported by Congress unless and until Pakistan demonstrates more robust efforts against terrorists that threaten America,&quot; McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>F-16s</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States has sold F-16s to Pakistan for decades. But&nbsp;after the U.S. military&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pakistan-fighters-idUSKCN0VL2CS\">approved the sale</a> of eight F-16s to Pakistan in February, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-planes-idUSKCN0XT1U6\">congressional leaders said</a> they would block U.S. financing and Pakistan would have to pay for the F-16s with its own money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Given congressional opposition to financing the F-16 sale with Foreign Military Financing (FMF), we asked the Pakistanis to fund the sale entirely,&quot; said State Department spokesman Josh Paul. &quot;Pakistan did not accept this offer, and the terms of the sale have expired.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCain wanted a hearing on the F-16s then, saying he was &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-fighters-idUSKCN0VY233\">conflicted</a>&quot; with the proposed sale, noting potential consequences in the U.S.-India&nbsp;relationship. (There was concern that Pakistan could use the weapons <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2016/04/28/pakistan-could-use-f-16-jets-against-india-u-s-politicians-say/\">against India</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Romero reiterated that McCain can only see a scenario where the United States&nbsp;finances F-16s is if Pakistan bolsters its anti-terrorism efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward&rsquo;s campaign cited Pakistan news website Business Recorder, which quotes Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria as saying McCain&rsquo;s visit was related to &quot;defense cooperation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ward campaign also referenced a <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1267142\">June 24 meeting</a> between McCain and former Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari in Los Angeles.&nbsp;McCain&rsquo;s campaign confirmed this meeting, saying it was part of his regular meetings with world leaders. A Pakistani government account of the meeting recounts Zardari making the case for American F-16s and drones to fight terrorists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebastian also noted that most of the senator&rsquo;s itinerary was not available in advance because of security concerns. McCain&rsquo;s daily schedule is not released publicly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While F-16s and weapon sales were not the only, or even primary, purpose of the CoDel (congressional delegation) trip, it certainly seems to have been a prominent part of the agenda,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s a much softer take than the message of&nbsp;the campaign&nbsp;ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pakistan on terror</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now for the Ward attack&#39;s characterization of Pakistan as the &quot;folks who harbored Osama bin Laden.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, bin Laden was found and killed at a compound in Pakistan in 2011.&nbsp;But University of Michigan history professor Juan Cole, who has written extensively about the Middle East, questioned the graphic&rsquo;s portrayal of Pakistan in the terrorism fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The implication is that Pakistan is an enemy of the U.S., whereas it is designated as a non-NATO ally,&quot; Cole said. &quot;McCain&#39;s trip is not about arms sales but broader diplomacy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakistan has a mixed history dealing with terrorism, despite aiding in the 2003 capture of suspected <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-cia\">9/11 mastermind Khalid Shiekh Mohammed</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Pakistan has failed to attack, and in some cases even provided support and safe haven to a variety of other militant/terrorist groups, including the Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba, that have attacked U.S. troops in Afghanistan and have killed U.S. citizens in India,&quot; said Daniel Markey, an international relations professor at Johns Hopkins University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakistan does have an Anti-Terrorism Act, which was established in 1997. But the U.S. Institute of Peace even concludes in a August 2015 report that it offers a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/SR377-An-Appraisal-of-Pakistan%E2%80%99s-Anti-Terrorism-Act.pdf\">very weak deterrence</a>&quot; against terrorism, as conviction rates remain low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Pakistan has a lot of problems, it has not been a great ally,&quot; said Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Alyssa Ayres. &quot;(But) it also is the supply route to support our troops in Afghanistan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the accusation that McCain was engineering a sale to people who &quot;harbored&quot; bin Laden, that is also unproven.&nbsp;Ward&rsquo;s campaign referenced a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/14/pakistani-leaders-knew-osama-bin-laden-was-in-pakistan-says-former-defense-minister/\">October 2015 <em>Washington Post </em>story</a> that quotes Pakistan&rsquo;s former defense minister as saying it was &quot;probable&quot; that the Pakistani military knew of bin Laden&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Markey said the ad&#39;s claim jumps too far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&#39;t yet have evidence that top Pakistani military or civilian leaders knew of bin Laden&#39;s whereabouts or &lsquo;harbored&rsquo; him, as it says in the graphic,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward said&nbsp;McCain was in Pakistan during the Fourth of July weekend&nbsp;selling &quot;F-16s and advanced weapons&quot; to the folks who &quot;harbored Osama bin Laden.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we spoke with disagreed. The ad distorts McCain&rsquo;s mission in Pakistan to stir up questions about his patriotism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While McCain has discussed F-16 fighter jets with Pakistani officials, the meeting over the holiday weekend was part of a larger effort to fight terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the ad oversimplifies Pakistan&#39;s complicated relationship with the United States. There is plenty of legitimate&nbsp;concern about the country&#39;s approach to terrorist groups, but there is no definitive proof that Pakistan (particularly the ones who met with McCain) harbored bin Laden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Ward&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/76ddba0b-4e0a-4071-b0aa-a23573c3cc48\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/76ddba0b-4e0a-4071-b0aa-a23573c3cc48</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-13T18:28:33.516757", "ruling_date": "2016-07-14T17:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rival claims John McCain visited Pakistan to sell weapons to 'folks who harbored Osama bin Laden'", "ruling_headline_slug": "image-claims-john-mccain-visited-pakistan-sell-wea", "ruling_link_text": "Claims unfounded", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Kelli Ward, &quot;McCain graphic,&quot; July 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Recorder, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.brecorder.com/top-stories/0/62015/\">McCain-led delegation due tomorrow</a>,&quot; July 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-usa-idUSKCN0ZJ0OL\">Senator McCain, visiting Pakistan, seeks better ties in Islamic fight</a>,&quot; July 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pakistan-fighters-idUSKCN0VL2CS\">U.S. OKs sale of 8 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan</a>,&quot; Feb. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-fighters-idUSKCN0VY233\">Senator McCain wants hearing on possible F-16 sale to Pakistan</a>,&quot; Feb. 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/14/pakistani-leaders-knew-osama-bin-laden-was-in-pakistan-says-former-defense-minister/\">Pakistani leaders knew Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan, says former defense minister</a>,&quot; Oct. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DAWN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/news/1267142\">Zardari meets Senator McCain, seeks support for F-16 sale</a>,&quot; June 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/lahore-bombing-fuels-fears-isis-foothold-pakistan-n547411\">Lahore bombing fuels fears of ISIS foothold in Pakistan</a>,&quot; March 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Air Force, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/224/Article/104505/f-16-fighting-falcon.aspx\">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>,&quot; accessed July 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Institute of Peace, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/SR377-An-Appraisal-of-Pakistan%E2%80%99s-Anti-Terrorism-Act.pdf\">An appraisal of Pakistan&rsquo;s Anti-Terrorism Act</a>,&quot; accessed July 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Yorker, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-cia\">Khalid Shiek Mohammed and the CIA</a>,&quot; Dec. 31, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2016/04/28/pakistan-could-use-f-16-jets-against-india-u-s-politicians-say/\">Pakistan could use F-16 jets against India, U.S. politicians say</a>,&quot; April 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero, July 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Ward campaign spokesman Stephen Sebastian, July 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Johns Hopkins University international relations professor Daniel Markey, July 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with University of Michigan history professor Juan Cole, July 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Alyssa Ayres, July 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with State Department spokesman Josh Paul, July 11, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kelli ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 3590, "last_name": "Ward", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "kelli-ward", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ward.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Arizona", "edition": "Arizona", "edition_slug": "arizona", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 56, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Arizona Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/56/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3590/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.kelliward.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Sen.
