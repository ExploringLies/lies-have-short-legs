Let&#39;s make it work,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;We now have driven costs down to the lowest they&#39;ve been in 50 years. Now we&#39;ve got to get individual costs down. That&#39;s what I&#39;m planning to do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health care costs are the lowest in 50 years? That&#39;s probably news to consumers who keep seeing their premiums and copays going up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check the vital signs of this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Clinton was incorrect. The actual per-person cost of health care has increased steadily over the last half-century, according to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/healthcostreport_final_noembargo_v2.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a 2013 White House report</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Nick Merrill said what Clinton was actually talking about was <em>the rate</em> at which health care costs have been going up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Health care price inflation is at its lowest rate in 50 years,&quot; he said in an email, adding that it is &quot;currently running at just 1 percent on a year-over-year basis, the lowest level since January 1962.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cited the same <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/healthcostreport_final_noembargo_v2.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>White House report from November 2013</u></a> to support that assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has touched on this issue before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-said-health-care-premiums-went-slower-any-ti/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a 2012 president debate</u></a>, President Barack Obama said that because of Obamacare, &quot;over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it&#39;s true -- but they&#39;ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Obama&#39;s point about premiums was wrong, and gave him a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-said-health-care-premiums-went-slower-any-ti/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we did find, more to the point that Clinton&#39;s campaign says Clinton was trying to make, that health care spending at the time had grown slower than at any time in the previous 50 years.
