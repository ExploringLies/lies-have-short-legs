In a debate Monday night, Republican Rep. George Holding sounded off on the ACA, also known as Obamacare, for raising premiums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent, and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we&rsquo;re all paying 100 percent more,&quot; Holding said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding&rsquo;s complaint was a popular refrain for Republicans last year, so PolitiFact has already checked similar claims from <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/15/donald-trump/donald-trumps-claim-about-obamacare-premiums-doubl/\">President Donald Trump</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-under-obamacare-american-families-/\">Vice President Mike Pence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/03/paul-ryan/testing-paul-ryan-claim-obamacare-premium-increase/\">House Speaker Paul Ryan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/oct/04/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-obamacare-premiums-more-doubled-f/\">Sen. John Cornyn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/25/james-lankford/did-obamacare-premiums-double-most-states-year-no/\">Sen. James Lankford</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the race between Holding and Democrat Linda Coleman, a former member of the state legislature, has morphed into one of the nation&rsquo;s more competitive contests, so we decided to put Holding&rsquo;s claim to the Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Holding&rsquo;s claim that &quot;we&rsquo;re all paying 100 percent more&quot; is highly misleading because it conflates the whole insured population with the 2 to 5 percent of people who buy their coverage on the individual market.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The numbers at first glance</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Holding campaign declined to comment, but Republicans making similar claims last year often cited a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/25/james-lankford/did-obamacare-premiums-double-most-states-year-no/\">report</a> from the Department of Health and Human Services, which compared premiums from 2013 &mdash; a year before the ACA took full effect &mdash; to premiums in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report looked at policies purchased on the individual market and found that premiums were 105 percent higher on average in 2017 than they were four years earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/premiums-federally-facilitated-exchanges-drop-2019\">press release</a> from the HHS&rsquo;s Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed that premiums had more than doubled since Obamacare was put in place. &quot;Average individual market premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on HealthCare.gov in 2017, an increase of $2,928 or 105 percent,&quot; the press release said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts agree that premiums have gone up, but some have said the 2017 HHS report should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The report&rsquo;s limitations</div>\r\n\r\n<p>David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University&rsquo;s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the 2013 and 2017 figures in the HHS report are not an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Their comparison is based on two totally different universes of individuals who are being covered,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;The ACA market is significantly more morbid, which means more sick, which means higher claim levels than the pre-2014 market.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because before ACA regulations took full effect, people who had pre-existing conditions or other risk factors could be denied coverage or charged higher rates, Anderson explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the HHS report ignored subsidies provided under Obamacare, which lowered out-of-pocket expenses for many policyholders in 2017. These post-subsidy costs are more important anyway, since that&rsquo;s what they actually have to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HHS study also listed several limitations to its findings, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A note that Obamacare imposed many new regulations not fully in place until 2014. &quot;In most states, these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans,&quot; the report said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A note acknowledging that &quot;older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool (in 2017) than in 2013.&quot; The report said this change was likely &quot;a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A note explaining that the report did not factor in premium changes in states that set up their own online exchanges, such as California. &quot;To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges, the national average increase may differ,&quot; the report said.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With these limitations in mind, Anderson pointed instead to <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-states%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">data from the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, a leading authority on health care, which he said shows how premiums have changed within the individual market as defined by the ACA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That data compared monthly premiums from 2014 and 2018 and showed that they rose from $273 to $481 during that period for a slightly smaller increase of about 76 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Anderson also said Holding was right that 91 percent of people are currently insured. But even still, the numbers were not the biggest problem with Holding&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Conflating the insurance markets</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Anderson said Holding&rsquo;s claim that &quot;we&rsquo;re all paying 100 percent more&quot; was &quot;extremely problematic&quot; because most people do not get insurance on the individual market, which typically provides coverage that is less comprehensive but more costly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is, in my opinion, a very deceptive statement by Rep. Holding, as he is conflating the ACA created and regulated individual market with general experience in other, non-ACA regulated group and government market segments,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html\">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. Approximately 19 and 17 percent are insured through Medicaid and Medicare, respectively, and a final 5 percent have military-provided coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s individual market covers only about 5 percent of the population, and the percentage that does not receive help from subsidies is even smaller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The ACA premium increases that (Holding) references are relevant for 2 to 5 percent of the population in the individual market,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;They are not reflective of what 86 to 88 percent of the population pays in premiums, where premiums have increased at a far slower rate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citing data from the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-2019-medicare-parts-b-premiums-and-deductibles\">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.shadac.org/sites/default/files/ESI_Fact_Sheets_October2018/US_Oct18.pdf\">State Health Access Data Assistance Center</a>, Anderson said premiums for people covered by their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid have risen at a much slower rate. Employer-sponsored insurance premiums, for example, jumped about 14 to 17 percent between 2013 and 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Holding has cherry-picked the worst example that covers the smallest number of people and implied that everyone is paying 100 percent more for their coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding said, &quot;Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we&rsquo;re all paying 100 percent more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are fragments of truth in that, but the way he&rsquo;s constructed that statement makes it a significant distortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a 100 percent increase is what was reported in 2017 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the comparison distorts the truth that the vast majority of Americans encountered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding&rsquo;s claim that &quot;we&rsquo;re all paying 100 percent more&quot; was especially misleading because only 2 to 5 percent of people are affected by premium increases on the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s individual market. Holding cherry-picked the smallest market for insurance and suggested that everyone was suffering that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for most people, the premium increases have not been nearly as steep as he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, it&rsquo;s simply not true that &quot;we&rsquo;re all paying 100 percent more.&quot; In fact, the vast majority of Americans get their coverage from employers, Medicare or Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters&rsquo; Lab and PolitiFact.
