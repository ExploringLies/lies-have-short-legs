Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., opined in a Fox News post that sanctuary cities threaten public safety and that their policies are lawless. She also linked a decline in Phoenix&rsquo;s murder rate to the city&rsquo;s abandonment of a sanctuary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sanctuary cities endanger their citizens,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/09/rep-marsha-blackburn-to-save-lives-and-money-must-cut-off-federal-funding-for-sanctuary-cities.html\">Blackburn wrote</a> in a Nov. 9 opinion piece. &quot;When Phoenix dropped its sanctuary city policy in 2008, its murder rate fell 27 percent the following year, and other violent crime rates also fell.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So-called sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities, and the extent of their limitations vary widely. President Donald Trump has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1400/cancel-all-funding-sanctuary-cities/\">promised to cut their federal funding</a>, a move supported by Blackburn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know if Blackburn was accurate in her claim that Phoenix&rsquo; murder rate dropped 27 percent after the city abandoned a sanctuary policy. We did find a decline in the murder rate, but the extent attributable to a policy change is questionable.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Did Phoenix have a sanctuary policy?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no widely accepted legal definition for &quot;sanctuary cities,&quot; but the term is generally applied to jurisdictions that claim that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, not a local one. They argue that reporting individuals to immigration officials can undermine communities&rsquo; trust in law enforcement officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phoenix officials pushed back on the premise that the city ever had sanctuary policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The city has never been a &lsquo;sanctuary city&rsquo;. We consistently comply with federal and state immigration requirements,&quot; said Tammy Vo, spokeswoman for the City of Phoenix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phoenix Police Department Spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard also told PolitiFact they&rsquo;ve &quot;never had a policy that made us a sanctuary city.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blackburn did not return repeated requests for information for this fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we found that some groups considered Phoenix a sanctuary city based on a police department policy up to 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, in May 2008 issued a <a href=\"http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/judicial-watch-statement-regarding-phoenix-police-departments-reversal-illegal-alien-861912.htm\">statement</a> saying the Phoenix police chief was making changes to a policy which the group said &quot;prohibited police officers from inquiring about the immigration status of individuals and from cooperating with federal immigration officials.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration, in August 2010 also <a href=\"https://cis.org/Vaughan/Sanctuary-Safer-City\">said</a> that until 2008, &quot;Phoenix was considered by many to be a sanctuary for illegal aliens.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.policeforum.org/assets/docs/Free_Online_Documents/Immigration/police%20and%20immigration%20-%20how%20chiefs%20are%20leading%20their%20communities%20through%20the%20challenges%202010.pdf\">2010 report</a> from Police Executive Research Forum said a policy prohibiting Phoenix officers from contacting immigration officials was interpreted by some as providing a &quot;sanctuary city&quot; for undocumented immigrants. That policy came under scrutiny after a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spade-donates-to-slain-officers-family/\">police officer was</a> <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/man-who-killed-phoenix-officer-had-been-deported/article_772e6b37-eeea-59d4-a80e-e3c2ed1f9add.html\">shot and killed in September 2007</a> by an immigrant in the country illegally, the report said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A revised policy implemented in May 2008 required officers to question everyone arrested about their citizenship; allowed officers to contact federal authorities (after supervisory approval) when they suspected an arrestee was in the country illegally; and required records of all contacts with ICE, the report said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Was there a link between the murder rate drop and policy change?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While we did not hear back from Blackburn&rsquo;s office, we found similarities between her claim and a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/30/crime-drops-in-phoenix-after-city-drops-sanctuary-city-status-former-cops-say.html\">June 2017 Fox News report</a>, headlined, &quot;Crime drops in Phoenix after city drops sanctuary city status, former cops say.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News cited <a href=\"http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-Phoenix-Arizona.html\">City-Data.com</a>, saying its numbers showed that &quot;from 2008 to 2009 Phoenix&#39;s murder rate fell 27 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City-Data.com&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-Phoenix-Arizona.html\">figures</a> appear to stem from <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2009\">FBI Uniform Crime Reporting</a> <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2008\">data</a> on murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts cautioned against assuming that a change in one policy is the sole cause of a murder rate decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In terms of Phoenix (and other major metro areas around the country &mdash; both &lsquo;sanctuary&rsquo; and &lsquo;non-sanctuary&rsquo;), crime rates, including homicide, actually began falling well before before 2008 and have generally continued to drop since,&quot; said Daniel E. Mart&iacute;nez, an assistant professor in the School of Sociology at the University of Arizona. &quot;The supposed relationship that Blackburn is citing is likely due to several other factors beyond these policies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a proper study analyzing Phoenix&rsquo;s murder rates years before and after a policy and how it compares to similar cities, claims that one policy change drove down the murder rate are suspicious, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor in the department of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other possible changes in Phoenix, such as better policing, and whether Phoenix&rsquo;s murder rate decline was consistent with nationwide trends are also important to consider, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When one event occurs before another, statisticians say that shows correlation but not necessarily causation. I would be very skeptical of the causation claim, even if it turns out that Phoenix had a sanctuary policy that it rescinded in 2008,&quot; said Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&amp;M University School of Law. &quot;You would need a much more rigorous study, including study of other factors that may have caused the drop.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to City-Data.com, cited by Fox News, the murder rate in Phoenix dropped 10 percent from 2006 to 2007, and about 24 percent from 2007 to 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the policy change in Phoenix happened in May 2008, so there were a few months in that calendar year under the former policy. From 2009 to 2010, the Phoenix murder rate did not change; it increased about 4 percent from 2010 to 2011, according to City-Data.com&rsquo;s figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soc4.12547/abstract\">review article</a> by Martinez and two other colleagues notes they are only aware of four empirical studies systematically examining the relationship between limited cooperation policies and crime. &quot;None of the studies support the claim that &#39;sanctuaries&#39;&nbsp;are more crime\u2010prone than non\u2010sanctuaries,&quot; their paper said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Blackburn wrote, &quot;When Phoenix dropped its sanctuary city policy in 2008, its murder rate fell 27 percent the following year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the murder rate did decline, experts say the change is likely attributable to many factors, not just a single policy change. Phoenix officials claim the city has never been a &quot;sanctuary city,&quot; but some groups pegged the city as such based on a policy in place up to 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Blackburn&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-16T17:10:59.321133", "ruling_date": "2017-11-17T10:48:21", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
