Today&rsquo;s mark of $7.25 is 15.6 percent less. That&rsquo;s not quite 20 percent as Obama said, but it&rsquo;s in the ballpark (exactly 20 percent less would put today&rsquo;s minimum wage at $6.87).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you take a look, you&rsquo;ll see that adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage dropped every year of Reagan&rsquo;s presidency. Today&rsquo;s minimum wage is 15 percent more than what it was in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we pointed out in a previous fact check, Reagan was the only president never to oversee a boost in the minimum wage. So invoking the Gipper to push a minimum wage hike is a tough sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the White House. They sent us minimum wage figures&nbsp;adusted for inflation similar to what we calculated (about 18.8 percent higher in 1981, by their numbers).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said, &quot;the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan&quot; gave his first State of the Union address. Obama&#39;s not far off, but it&rsquo;s actually closer to 16 percent less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And using Reagan to make a case to raise the minimum wage should be taken with a grain of salt since the former president never increased it during his two terms. And by Reagan&rsquo;s last State of the Union, the minimum wage was $2 less than when he first took office, if you factor in inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is largely accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE, Jan. 29, 2014</strong>: After we published this story, an alert reader noted that our original paraphrase of part of Obama&#39;s quote was inaccurate. We had written that Obama had said &quot;the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan&quot; gave his first State of the Union address. As the reader pointed out, a new president&#39;s first address to a joint session of Congress -- the 1981 speech that Obama was referring to -- is not officially called a State of the Union address. So we have rewritten our paraphrase in the ruling statement above to remove the reference to the State of the Union. It does not affect the rating of Mostly True.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-28T23:50:53.305380", "ruling_date": "2014-01-29T00:00:45", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says the minimum wage was higher during Ronald Reagan's first State of the Union", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-minimum-wage-was-higher-during-r", "ruling_link_text": "Adjusted for inflation, Obama's numbers are close", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Barack Obama State of the Union Address, January 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barack Obama,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/24/remarks-president-economy-knox-college-galesburg-il\">remarks</a>&nbsp;at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., July 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Labor, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm\">History of Federal Minimum Wage Rates Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1938 - 2009</a>,&quot; accessed July 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">inflation calculator</a>, accessed July 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42973.pdf\">Inflation and the Real Minimum Wage: A Fact Sheet</a>,&quot; June 21, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data360.org,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=762\">graph of nominal and real minimum wage through history</a>, accessed July 31, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan&quot; gave his first address to a joint session of Congress.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the State of the Union address", "statement_date": "2014-01-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
