We used that summary as a guide and inspected additional gun control efforts in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted by Morain, Newsom was &quot;hardly the first California big city politician to take on the NRA.&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sherry Bebitch Jeffee, professor of public policy at USC, added the claim about Newsom being &quot;first,&quot; doesn&rsquo;t hold up to the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California&rsquo;s been at the forefront of the gun control movement for a very long time,&quot; Jeffee said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at earlier efforts by prominent California politicians:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dianne Feinstein</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1983, then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein defeated an <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article24746311.html\">NRA-supported recall</a>, Morain noted. The recall started after Feinstein backed a failed statewide initiative to regulate handguns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein&rsquo;s signature gun control measure came two years into her career in the U.S. Senate. She introduced and helped pass the now-expired 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which was also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/03/02/before-trump-defied-the-nra-ronald-reagan-took-on-the-gun-lobby/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.516ec25077a7\">opposed</a> by the NRA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tom Bradley</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1989, then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley signed a city ordinance that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/08/us/los-angeles-bans-rapid-firing-guns.html\">banned</a> the sale or possession of semi-automatic weapons. Morain described that as &quot;as a landmark bill at a time when the NRA was able to <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dan-morain/article40786194.html\">win elections in California</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Antonio Villaraigosa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Villaraigosa also has gun control credentials. In 1999, then-Assembly Speaker Villaraigosa helped pass a statewide assault weapons ban, though he did not author it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The time is now to ban assault weapons,&quot; he was quoted as saying in a <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Tough-Assault-Weapons-Ban-Awaits-Governor-s-2918834.php\">article</a> at the time. &quot;It is time to use the power of the Legislature to say with one loud voice that we should all move beyond Columbine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luis Vizcaino, a spokesman for Villaraigosa&rsquo;s campaign for governor, described the former LA mayor&rsquo;s gun control efforts in a statement to PolitiFact California:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mayor Villaraigosa has been taking on the NRA throughout his career. Under his speakership, California passed some of the boldest gun control measures in the country, including what was at the time the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation and greater oversight of gun shows -- all of which was vigorously opposed by the NRA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More from Newsom</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s gun control history isn&rsquo;t limited to 2016. During his time as San Francisco&#39;s mayor, Newsom signed into law the voter-approved Proposition H in 2005. It outlawed citizens from possessing handguns and prevented the manufacture, sale and distribution of guns and ammunition in the city. However, it was <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Judge-invalidates-Prop-H-handgun-2494855.php\">struck down</a> by a San Francisco Superior Court judge less than a year after it was passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a phone interview earlier this week, Newsom&rsquo;s campaign spokesman Nathan Click expanded on the claim that Newsom was &quot;the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He clarified that it was intended to show Newsom was the &quot;first person in California history to propose and pass a statewide ballot measure strengthening gun safety laws.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the claim is made in the ad, text appears showing a headline &quot;Newsom Fights The NRA Over Gun Control.&quot; This appears to be a reference to an October 2017 <em>Los Angeles Times</em> news <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-lt-gov-gavin-newsom-fights-nra-over-1508537822-htmlstory.html\">article</a> with a similar headline. It describes Newsom&rsquo;s request that a federal judge lift an order that blocked Proposition 63&rsquo;s ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines. We didn&rsquo;t find any information in the article or elsewhere showing Newsom&rsquo;s argument swayed the judge to lift the order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you&rsquo;re trying to convey a series of ideas in 30 seconds, you&rsquo;re limited by the format,&quot; Click added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said the ad did not intend to discount earlier accomplishments by other California politicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While that&rsquo;s helpful, PolitiFact places ratings on the original statements, not revisions or clarifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TV advertisement by the Gavin Newsom for Governor campaign claimed Newsom was &quot;the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim, however, ignores major gun control measures passed by California politicians from U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to former Los Angeles mayors Tom Bradley and Antonio Villaraigosa, in the face of NRA opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s campaign spokesman said the claim in the ad was meant to convey a more specific accomplishment, showing Newsom as the first to push through a statewide gun safety ballot measure. We&rsquo;re not challenging that statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we rate the original claim as False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\"><em>UPDATE: The Newsom campaign says it has not pulled its &quot;First&quot; TV ad that includes the&nbsp;claim PolitiFact California rated False.
