Bernie Sanders, speaking in Austin, bemoaned widening income differences between the country&rsquo;s very rich and the rest of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in his remarks at a <a href=\"http://www.ibew520.org/home_1.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>South Austin union hall</u></a>, the Vermont independent <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/bernie-sanders-isnt-so-sure-about-this-2016-thing-116031.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>mulling a run </u></a>for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination also warned about American failures to save money. &quot;Here&rsquo;s something not talked about, something that can make us all very, very nervous,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And you know what that means and you know why people are so stressed out? If you have less than $10,000,&quot; he said, &quot;that means an automobile accident, a divorce, a serious illness, a crisis of one kind or another can drive you into bankruptcy and financial disaster.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is he right that half of us have less than $10K in savings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sanders&rsquo; backup</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our inquiry, a Sanders spokesman, Jeff Franks, said by email that Sanders relied on an April 2014 <em>USA Today</em> <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2014/03/18/retirement-confidence-survey-savings/6432241/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news story </u></a>quoting a survey indicating 52 percent of U.S. workers had said they had less than $10,000 in total savings and investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA, that could be used for retirement. It did not include their homes or defined benefit plans, such as traditional pensions that could be used for retirement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the story said, 36 percent of workers said they had less than $1,000 in such savings and investments with another 16 percent of workers reporting $1,000 to $9,999 in such savings and investments. Those results came from a telephone survey of 1,000 workers and 501 retirees by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald and Associates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we spotted a chart on the institute&rsquo;s website drawn from the same 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey. The 52 percent of workers reporting less than $10,000 in savings and investments in 2014 is up from 39 percent in 2009, the chart shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"04012015 savingschart2014report.JPG\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OXRpZ2Kla7guRDuD_uH8tP7O6EatkolYbZ72l0hKbz4wh87UoMgxVR1zeXyuyFheu7uwP3CI81o0t-2aqqLCAym2v3mkCgr_yXFErC4qkV9ZqKSqy8sgtyymfygnFsZV6BmsIVw\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:464px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /><br />\r\nOf course, &quot;workers&quot; isn&rsquo;t all of us. We called the Washington, D.C.-based institute, <a href=\"http://www.ebri.org/about/facts/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>which says</u></a> it was founded in 1978 to deliver unbiased information on employee benefit plans &quot;so that decisions affecting the system may be made based on verifiable facts.&quot; By phone, researcher Craig Copeland told us that overall, 51 percent of survey respondents, meaning retirees and others, had less than $10,000 in financial savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also by phone, Ruth Helman of Greenwald and Associates, which helped do the survey, paused at the senator&rsquo;s wording. &quot;Strictly speaking, &lsquo;their savings account&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t correct. It&rsquo;s total savings wherever it may be, under the mattress or wherever,&quot; Helman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Federal Reserve Bank</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if there were other ways of looking at savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several experts urged us to contact the Federal Reserve Bank, which conducts a survey focused on consumer finances every three years. <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/pdf/scf14.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Its latest survey</u></a>, drawing on data collected in 2013, resulted in a chart pointed out by Copeland indicating that the median value of financial savings outside of a pension or home reported by the nearly 95 percent of families who had bank accounts or stocks, bonds and other financial assets that year was $21,200, down from $23,000 in the board&rsquo;s 2010 survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"040115 frb2013chart.JPG\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GLOxVEtuSAy85-MyzfUWUM5s4QZPO5Wg0XNaJLWz0aqDS1zYsvbkkiRbD2AoahGjQHHkEPtpKOh_RChQvm3px_EJsqKokwMIObd4vqNVUXBnzLZ8RIqlbNwr6rRTbPKhahoYT_Y\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:543px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /><strong>SOURCE: </strong>Report, <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/pdf/scf14.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,&quot;</u></a> Federal Reserve Bulletin, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copeland said that given that more than 5 percent of families reported no such financial assets, it&rsquo;s reasonable to speculate that families overall had median financial savings of less than $20,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also asked reserve board officials to analyze the senator&rsquo;s &quot;savings accounts&quot; statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, William Emmons and Bryan Noeth, both employed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, raised questions. For instance, why not count a family&rsquo;s home or pension as part of its savings? &nbsp;Reminder: The institute, with its focus on savings for retirement, set aside these asset categories. Emmons said: &quot;People do count on their housing equity, not only in retirement, but before that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond that, the pair said, it&rsquo;s not always meaningful to focus on money held in &quot;savings accounts,&quot; which are a single wealth indicator. &quot;A savings account isn&rsquo;t where everybody holds their money,&quot; Noeth said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two said a potentially superior way to gauge how Americans are faring, savings-wise, would be to consider net worth meaning family assets compared to debts. An agency manager, Adriene Dempsey, emailed us <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1biz67W-FEiq0Spls_Vg7gZEC4AvT-BM7w0PDcJbTMzo/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a spreadsheet</u></a> showing that according to the board&rsquo;s 2013 survey, 26 percent of U.S. families had less than $10,000 in net worth--a tick worse than the 25 percent of families according to its 2010 study. In 2013, half of American families had about $81,500 in net wealth or more, according to the spreadsheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total assets for a family include financial assets, such as bank accounts, mutual funds and securities plus tangible assets, including real estate, vehicles and durable goods, according to a <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/Files/PDFs/HFS/essays/HFS-Essay-1-2015-Race-Ethnicity-and-Wealth.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>February 2015 essay</u></a> by the St. Louis Fed. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kk6toEUXX3qSJ525ZHJDp8BZ5mHHyrQ24HrdQuB9fQw/pub\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>We&rsquo;ve elaborated on this here</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So by the net-worth metric, more families are better off than if one focused on financial savings alone.
