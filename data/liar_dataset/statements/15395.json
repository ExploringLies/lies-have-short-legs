Bush</a> in October 2001. (Wisconsin Democrat <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/russ-feingold/\">Russ Feingold</a> cast the lone no vote in the Senate.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure granted law enforcement increased surveillance powers to intercept phone and email communications in the name of fighting terrorism, but with little judicial or congressional oversight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on a law he signed in 2015, PolitiFact National gave Democratic President <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/\">Barack Obama</a> a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/179/revise-the-patriot-act-to-increase-oversight-on-go/\">Promise Kept</a> on his pledge to revise the law to increase oversight on government surveillance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what else has Sensenbrenner done?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An apology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked for evidence to back up the claim, Palzewicz&rsquo;s campaign staff sent us this statement, attributed to the candidate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>My campaign used imprecise language, which is an issue in a medium such as Twitter where brevity is king. We were expressing the opinion that over a 40-year career, he doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of major legislation to his name. The Patriot Act is the only thing of note. That said, it&rsquo;s not 100% accurate, in that he has had his name on other pieces of legislation, and I apologize for that.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter can be hazardous, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we found that Palzewicz also made the attack <a href=\"https://www.crowdpac.com/campaigns/385605/tom-palzewicz\">on a website</a> he&rsquo;s using to raise money for his campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>500 sponsorships</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Republican Party responded to us on Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s behalf, citing <a href=\"http://www.congress.gov\">Congress.gov</a> data.
