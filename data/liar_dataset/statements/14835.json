But both the Breitbart and Gateway Pundit articles are still searchable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found them by scrolling down the Breitbart and Gateway Pundit Facebook pages. The claim that no one will be able to see the story on Facebook is flat-out wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unless an article violates Facebook&rsquo;s community standards, it&rsquo;s not removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook does, however, downrank disputed articles. That means they are pushed lower down on users&rsquo; newsfeeds, although the severity of downranking varies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a user tries to share the original Gateway Pundit story through Facebook, a pop-up appears saying &quot;Before you share this content, you might want to know that there is additional reporting on this from PolitiFact.&quot; A hyperlink that says &quot;Visit PolitiFact&quot; redirects the sharer to our report. But if the user clicks Continue, they are able to share the story as usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a person reading the story through the Gateway Pundit website tries to share the content to Facebook, the pop-up window never appears. The same applies for Breitbart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook does this for every story flagged as false.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our take on facts is that objective facts are objective facts, and their political provenance is irrelevant,&quot; Facebook spokesman Todd Breasseale said. &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if an objective fact was discovered or made apparent by a politically conservative organization or a politically liberal or an apolitical organization.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(PolitiFact is a nonpartisan fact-checking organization.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook relies on organizations like PolitiFact, Snopes, FactCheck.org and other fact-checkers to flag fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A Gateway Pundit headline said,&nbsp;&quot;Facebook picks sides in Alabama Senate race ... shuts down Gateway Pundit and Breitbart reports on discredited Allred accuser.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither the Gateway Pundit nor the Breitbart&nbsp;stories&nbsp;were&nbsp;taken down from Facebook, as the headline suggests. Instead, the Facebook algorithm made the stories less prevalent, as occurs with every story flagged as fake.
