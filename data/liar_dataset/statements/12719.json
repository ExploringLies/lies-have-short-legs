At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reached back about as far as one can go in Clinton&rsquo;s biography for an example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell said that Clinton &quot;lied about her emails, she lied about her server, she lied about Benghazi, she lied about sniper fire &mdash; why she even lied about why her parents named her Hillary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll look at the last one: Would Hillary Clinton lie about the origins of her name?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The public discussion of the anecdote about Clinton&rsquo;s naming dates back to her time as first lady.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 1995, she was on a goodwill tour of Asia and stopped in Nepal, the country that&rsquo;s home of Mount Everest, which was first climbed in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At an airstrip in Katmandu, Nepal &mdash; just after an overnight tiger safari and just before her departure for this poverty-ridden pocket of South Asia &mdash; Mrs. Clinton shook hands with&quot; the famous climber, then 75, the <em>New York Times</em> reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the brief meeting, Clinton &quot;confessed that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had read an article about the intrepid Edmund Hillary, a one-time beekeeper who had taken to mountain climbing, when she was pregnant with her daughter in 1947 and liked the name,&quot; the <em>Times </em>wrote. &quot; &lsquo;It had two l&#39;s, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,&rsquo; Mrs. Clinton told reporters after the brief meeting on the tarmac, minutes before her Air Force jet flew past the peak of Everest itself. &lsquo;So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it&#39;s because of Sir Edmund Hillary.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years, this story wasn&rsquo;t widely discussed &mdash; it wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s 2003 autobiography, <em>Living History</em>, for instance &mdash; but it did make its way into the autobiography of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, which was published in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within a few years, though, the story attracted some attention on the Internet when someone realized a key discrepancy -- the mountain climber achieved worldwide fame six years after Clinton was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, in October 2006, a Clinton spokeswoman walked the story back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,&#39;&#39; said spokeswoman Jennifer Hanley, according to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the urban-legends checking site Snopes.com <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/hillary.asp\">looked at the controversy</a>, it noted that it actually wasn&rsquo;t impossible that Clinton&rsquo;s mother could have heard about Hillary by the time her daughter was born. It noted that he was already gaining some renown as a mountain climber prior to 1953, and even as early as the pre-World War II period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, when Snopes scrutinized several major American newspapers, including the Rodhams&rsquo; hometown <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, prior to 1953, it couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence that the mountain climber had been profiled. This suggests that he was still too obscure a figure to have attracted Dorothy Rodham&rsquo;s attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was &quot;almost certainly a bit of fiction invented for political expediency,&quot; Snopes concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Clinton campaign for this article but did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell said that Clinton &quot;even lied about why her parents named her Hillary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton certainly said in 1995 that she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, but Clinton was born a few years before the mountain climber became famous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, McConnell fails to note that a spokeswoman eventually said the story was told to her by Clinton&rsquo;s mother to inspire her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell&rsquo;s claim is partially accurate but lacks important context. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b295bd5-ed1d-433b-95cb-8c0ba10b42fe\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b295bd5-ed1d-433b-95cb-8c0ba10b42fe</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-19T21:45:13.619514", "ruling_date": "2016-07-19T21:42:55", "ruling_headline": "Did Hillary Clinton lie about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-hillary-clinton-lie-about-being-named-after-si", "ruling_link_text": "She said it, but later backtracked", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mitch McConnell, remarks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;Hillary Clinton Meets Man Who Gave Her 2 L&#39;s,&quot; April 3, 1995 (accessed via Nexis)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;Hillary, Not as in the Mount Everest Guy,&quot; Oct. 17, 2006 (accessed via Nexis)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/hillary.asp\">Hillary vs. Hillary</a>,&quot; accessed July 19, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "Senate minority leader", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Mitch", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Kentucky", "id": 106, "last_name": "McConnell", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "mitch-mcconnell", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mcconnell.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/106/", "total_count": 33, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://mcconnell.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Hillary Clinton &quot;lied about why her parents named her Hillary.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland", "statement_date": "2016-07-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "Did Hillary Clinton lie about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary?"}
