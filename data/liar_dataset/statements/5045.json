Chris Christie, a Republican, has reminded listeners of that history during various radio interviews in recent weeks. During a Dec. 23 interview with WFAN&rsquo;s Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton, the governor corrected Carton when the co-host said Christie was raising tolls by 50 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Oh, and by the way, I&rsquo;m not raising tolls 50 percent,&quot; Christie said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCarton asked, &quot;Who is?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Jon Corzine did,&quot; the governor responded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie has his facts straight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe toll hikes, which took effect New Year&rsquo;s Day, represent the second phase of a two-part rate increase approved by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in October 2008 under then-Gov. Jon Corzine. A Democrat, Corzine, signed off on the plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first phase of the toll hikes began on Dec. 1, 2008 with 40 percent and 43 percent increases on the Turnpike and the Parkway, respectively. The second phase represents a 53 percent hike on the Turnpike and a 50 percent increase on the Parkway.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe toll increase was initially scheduled to support a $1.25 billion contribution to a Hudson River commuter train tunnel project, known as Access to the Region&#39;s Core, or ARC. But citing potential cost overruns, Christie terminated the project in October 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn September, the turnpike authority agreed to redirect $975 million from the canceled tunnel to local road and bridge projects. Those projects are part of a five-year capital plan unveiled by Christie earlier this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe increased toll revenue also is going toward the authority&rsquo;s $7 billion capital program, which includes a Turnpike widening project between exits 6 and 9.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a radio interview, Christie directed blame for the new toll hikes to his predecessor, claiming &quot;I&#39;m not raising tolls 50 percent....Jon Corzine did.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s planning to spend the money, but he didn&rsquo;t raise the tolls.
