It also puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk,&quot; Clinton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us can see ourselves spilling the beans on anything and everything if we were subjected to the kinds of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; that suspected terrorists have been subjected to by the United States since 9/11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if, as Clinton contended, it has been well established that torture does not work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell them what they want to hear</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because nobody&#39;s going to volunteer to be part of a scientific study where you might get tortured &mdash; ethics review boards might be apoplectic about such a proposal &mdash; the only way to examine the issue is through case studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experts with whom we spoke said that, for a host of reasons, torture has long been recognized as an inefficient way to get information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest problem is that it tends to produce wrong information. The United States Army Field Manual warns that <a href=\"https://www.cgu.edu/pdffiles/sbos/costanzo_effects_of_interrogation.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>information gathered by torture</u></a> can be faulty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s because, during torture, truth becomes irrelevant. And when the interrogators don&#39;t know if the information is true, the torture may continue even if the detainee tells the truth. At that point, the captive will fabricate information with the goal of telling the interrogator what he wants to hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is enormously well documented (including by the Senate study of the CIA program) that torture generated enormous amounts of false statements,&quot; said Lisa Hajjar,&nbsp;a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies torture. (More about the Senate study in a bit.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example was the case of Abu Zubaydah, initially billed by the Bush administration as al-Qaida&#39;s chief of operations. Waterboarded 83 times, he told tales of planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. <a href=\"https://law.utexas.edu/humanrights/events/speaker-series-papers/Hajjar_Does%20Torture%20Work.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Critics say</u></a> that&#39;s because he knew little. Joining al-Qaida after 9/11, he scheduled people to move in and out of training camps and was mentally challenged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration said it had &quot;information that Iraq had been training al-Qaida operatives in the use of chemical weapons, thus connecting Iraq to 9/11,&quot; said Hajjar&nbsp;in <a href=\"https://law.utexas.edu/humanrights/events/speaker-series-papers/Hajjar_Does%20Torture%20Work.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a review article</u></a> in the <em>Annual Review of Law and Social Science</em>. &quot;This information was extracted by torture from a Libyan prisoner, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, who subsequently recanted the lies he had told interrogators to make the pain stop.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bad truth detectors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interrogators aren&rsquo;t particularly good at telling when someone under torture is lying or telling the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Interrogators in these situations think they&#39;re perfect lie detectors but research tells us quite differently,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.reed.edu/poli_sci/faculty/rejali/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Darius Rejali</u></a>, a torture expert at Reed College in Oregon. Special training programs designed to enhance that ability &quot;make the interrogators more confident that they can detect the truth, but in fact they would be better off flipping a coin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the current war on terror, consider the case of Hassan Ghul. After his capture, he was cooperative without being tortured and provided information key to finding Osama bin Laden through bin Laden&#39;s associate, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. But after he cooperated,&nbsp;the CIA decided to torture Ghul anyway. It produced no useful additional intelligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The people who do know something will lie whether you torture them or not. The problem comes when you pull people in who don&#39;t know anything, and they&#39;re claiming that they do,&quot; said Rejali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That opens the door to all kinds of fanciful intelligence from crazed-from-torture&nbsp;informants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sleep deprivation will make you imagine you were there shooting (President John) Kennedy behind the grassy knoll,&quot; said Rejali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue is that news reports of torture turn public opinion against authorities who condone or permit torture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rejali cited the cases of a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4718797.stm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2005 bombing</u></a> attempt in London. When video of the bomber aired, &quot;the parents came forward and said, &#39;He&#39;s our son. He&#39;s the killer.&#39; Would the parents have come forward if they knew their son was going to be tortured? You can be fairly certain the answer to that is no.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not only does torture undermine what we know works, which is public cooperation, but it can also deeply alter the duration, severity and cost of a conflict,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Torture alienates societies needed for war efforts,&quot; said Hajjar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Senate torture report</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to the report by the <a href=\"http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/senate-intelligence-committee-study-on-cia-detention-and-interrogation-program\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</u></a>, released when Democrats controlled the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full document, about 6,700 pages and approved in 2012, remains classified.
