He noted the former president had decided to stay in Washington, and not for the reasons Obama has given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s only there for one purpose and one purpose only,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-kelly-obama-shadow-government_us_58c2faf0e4b0d1078ca6aa0b\">Kelly said</a>, &quot;and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that really what Obama stayed in Washington, D.C. to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama announced late in 2016 he&rsquo;d be sticking around in Washington for at least two years so his daughter Sasha could finish high school. He has office space paid for by the General Services Administration, a perk granted to all former presidents. <a href=\"http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/obamas-post-presidential-office-to-be-in-washington-d-c/\">According to the Chicago Sun Times</a>, Obama is the first president since Woodrow Wilson to stay at a primary residence in Washington, D.C. after his tenure ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama will be assisting former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a Congressional redistricting effort, work Holder <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/eric-holder-democrats-redistricting-233546 \">has described</a> as a &quot;going into the states&quot; strategy. Holder <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/eric-holder-obama-ready-public-235508\">also said</a> Obama would be fundraising and interacting with state legislators. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No reports or intelligence has been released linking these post-presidency activities of Obama to a shadow government. And Kelly did not provide any evidence. A shadow government is commonly defined as a conflicting, secondary government led by members of the private sector that wields similar influence to the actual government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly later withdrew his comments after they made national news. His spokesperson Tom Qualtere said, &quot;Because of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly&rsquo;s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government.&quot; In another statement, Qualtere said, &quot;he was sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump&rsquo;s agenda.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly&rsquo;s comments and his ensuing walkback landed in The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, The Hill and MSNBC. Aaron Blake, for the Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/11/gop-congressman-offers-strange-obama-conspiracy-theory-and-even-stranger-explanations/?utm_term=.592be8130d9d\">wrote</a> &quot;while the conspiracy theory is strange enough, the explanations offered by Kelly&#39;s office are something to behold.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson for Obama did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressman Mike Kelly accused President Barack Obama of operating a shadow government, saying he was only staying in Washington, D.C. for that &quot;one purpose and one purpose only.&quot; Yet there is no evidence Obama is running a shadow government, and Obama has provided another purpose for why he&rsquo;s staying in Washington: so his daughter Sasha can finish high school. Kelly&rsquo;s spokesperson later walked back the Congressman&rsquo;s statement, saying &quot;Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rule the claim Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" style=\"width: 100%;
