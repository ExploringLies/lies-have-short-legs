Chris Christie and you could be the one getting bruised.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the June 1 &quot;Week In Review&quot; on its website, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee suggested that we issued a True ruling on the claim by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman that the Republican governor is a &quot;fiscal phony.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the headline &quot;New York Times Calls Christie a Fiscal Phony,&quot; the post read as follows:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Paul Krugman, a columnist with the New York Times, called Governor Christie a &lsquo;fiscal phony&rsquo; this week for Christie&rsquo;s willingness to borrow money in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest New Jersey residents. Politifact found the Krugman&rsquo;s claims about Christie to be <strong>TRUE</strong>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/31/paul-krugman/chris-christies-jersey-comeback-challenged-new-yor/\">True ruling</a> was based on Krugman&rsquo;s claim about how the state&rsquo;s job growth during Christie&rsquo;s tenure has been less than the gains in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole. We did not rule on Krugman&#39;s &quot;fiscal phony&quot; statement, and our fact-check never addressed Christie&#39;s plans to borrow money and cut taxes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlicia D&#39;Alessandro, communications director for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, acknowledged the Democrats&rsquo; mistake in a statement. The website post was later changed to accurately reflect our fact-check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We did not mean to imply that Politifact was calling Christie a fiscal phony, although we wish you had done so, because he is,&quot; D&#39;Alessandro wrote. &quot;We do recognize that our language should have been more precise and that the sentence in question should have read: &#39;Politifact found Krugman&#39;s claims about anemic job growth under Christie to be TRUE.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review what our story was really about.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his May 28 column, Krugman said Christie &quot;proved himself just another standard fiscal phony.&quot; The liberal columnist criticized the governor&rsquo;s &quot;Jersey Comeback&quot; message in light of the job growth since Christie took office in January 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Here&rsquo;s the story: For some time now Mr. Christie has been touting what he calls the &lsquo;Jersey comeback,&rsquo;&quot; Krugman wrote. &quot;Even before his latest outburst, it was hard to see what he was talking about: yes, there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we explained in our May 31 ruling, Krugman&rsquo;s analysis was correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey&rsquo;s growth since the beginning of Christie&rsquo;s tenure has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the time of Krugman&#39;s statement, the April figures were preliminary.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut we never said Krugman&rsquo;s critique of Christie as a &quot;fiscal phony&quot; was accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the June 1 &quot;Week In Review&quot; on its website, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee claimed &quot;Paul Krugman, a columnist with the New York Times, called Governor Christie a &lsquo;fiscal phony&rsquo;&quot; and &quot;Politifact found the Krugman&rsquo;s claims about Christie to be <strong>TRUE</strong>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut our True ruling was based on Krugman&rsquo;s claim that New Jersey&rsquo;s job growth since Christie took office has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole. &quot;Fiscal phony&quot; is a catchy phrase, but it had nothing to do with our ruling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the Democrats&rsquo; claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/politifact_nj_nj_dems_claim_fa.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-05T17:08:26.233589", "ruling_date": "2012-06-06T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "New Jersey Democrats claim PolitiFact said it was True that Chris Christie is a fiscal phony", "ruling_headline_slug": "new-jersey-democrats-claims-politifact-said-it-was", "ruling_link_text": "A 'phony' claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey Democratic State Committee, <a href=\"http://njdems.org/index.php/chairmans_corner/the_njdsc_week_in_review_for_june_1_2012\">The Chairman&rsquo;s Corner: The NJDSC Week In Review for June 1, 2012</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/31/paul-krugman/chris-christies-jersey-comeback-challenged-new-yor/\">Chris Christie&rsquo;s &quot;Jersey Comeback&quot; challenged by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman</a>, May 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Times,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/opinion/krugman-fiscal-phonies.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=general\"> Big Fiscal Phonies</a>, May 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and e-mail interviews with Alicia D&#39;Alessandro, communications director for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, June 4-5, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1308, "last_name": "New Jersey Democratic State Committee", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "new-jersey-democratic-state-committee", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/demcom.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Jersey", "edition": "New Jersey", "edition_slug": "new-jersey", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 13, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Jersey Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/13/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1308/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.njdems.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays PolitiFact issued a True ruling on Paul Krugman calling &quot;Governor Christie a &lsquo;fiscal phony.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a newsletter", "statement_date": "2012-06-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Governor of New Jersey", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 27, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1251, "last_name": "Christie", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "chris-christie", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/christie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1251/", "total_count": 105, "true_count": 21, "website": "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
