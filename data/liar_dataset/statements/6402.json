Just recently, he said: &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a business &ndash; you didn&rsquo;t build that. Somebody else made that happen.&rsquo; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you are like me,&quot; Fleischmann continued, &quot;you were speechless at the President&rsquo;s latest arrogant attack on the foundation of the American economy. The President insists on pushing his view of successful businesses in America &ndash; that we owe the government for our success.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked to explain Fleischmann&rsquo;s comments, his campaign spokesman, Jordan Powell, said the blog item was built around Obama&rsquo;s remarks in Roanoke.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The president seems to think that the government is the engine of success, and Chuck thinks it&rsquo;s not so &ndash; it&rsquo;s the private sector and hard-working small business owners,&quot; Powell said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama&rsquo;s Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has made pretty much the same claim about the president at public events and in several ads. The Republican National Committee and the National Federation of Independent Businesses are among the groups that have released their own videos and statements claiming Obama is out of touch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe criticism has become so big a threat that Obama&rsquo;s re-election campaign felt the need to address the issue in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp8nC9dBhaQ&amp;feature=player_embedded\">web video</a> titled &quot;Tampered&quot; that quoted media accounts saying the quote had been taken out of context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t delve into the broader question of what President Obama thinks about businesses. Here, we will simply examine Fleischmann&rsquo;s claim that, in his campaign speech, Obama was saying &quot;small businesses succeed because of government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur colleagues at PolitiFact national have examined <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/\">similar claims</a> made by Romney and others and given them False rulings. Many of their points are repeated here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s begin by looking at the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia\">full context</a> of Obama&rsquo;s speech. Here&rsquo;s what he said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me -- because they want to give something back. They know they didn&rsquo;t -- look, if you&rsquo;ve been successful, you didn&rsquo;t get there on your own. You didn&rsquo;t get there on your own. I&rsquo;m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you&rsquo;ve got a business -- you didn&rsquo;t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn&rsquo;t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don&rsquo;t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That&rsquo;s how we funded the G.I. Bill. That&rsquo;s how we created the middle class. That&rsquo;s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That&rsquo;s how we invented the Internet. That&rsquo;s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m running for President -- because I still believe in that idea. You&rsquo;re not on your own, we&rsquo;re in this together.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen placed in context, it is obvious Obama was making the point that success comes from the combination of &quot;individual initiative&quot; and the fact that &quot;we do things together.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFleischmann and others who have criticized Obama&rsquo;s remarks omitted the lead-up to his statement -- that &quot;if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese words indicate Obama was referring to infrastructure and educational opportunities that were paid for by taxpayers through the government -- things that the President argues establishes a necessary foundation for making private businesses successful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think his meaning is clear -- that both business people and government play a role in the American enterprise system, not purely one or the other.<br />\r\n\t</b><br />\r\n\t<b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-weight: normal; \">Our ruling</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-weight: normal; \"> Rep.
