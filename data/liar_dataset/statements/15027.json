(Dial-up&nbsp;uses a modem and standard phone line to establish an internet connection.)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/general/types-broadband-connections\">Broadband technologies</a> include Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, cable modem and fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FCC benchmark for fixed (not mobile) broadband internet is speeds of 25 Megabits per second for downloads and 3 Megabits per second for uploads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A section of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to determine annually whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans &quot;in a reasonable and timely fashion,&quot; and if not, to take immediate action to accelerate deployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding Georgia&rsquo;s rural population without high-speed internet access, Kemp&rsquo;s campaign referred us to a May 2017 <a href=\"http://www.house.ga.gov/Committees/en-US/HouseRuralDevelopmentCouncil.aspx\">presentation</a> from the House Budget and Research Office given at a House Rural Development Council meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of that presentation said an estimated 626,070 individuals, or 25 percent of the rural population, were without access to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those figures trace back to the FCC&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-16-6A1.pdf\">2016 Broadband Progress Report</a>, which also found that 39 percent of all rural Americans did not have access to broadband internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The largest factor preventing access to unlimited &lsquo;high-speed&rsquo; broadband is the cost of buildout for the infrastructure,&quot; said Eric McRae, associate director of the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the technology being implemented, cost can range from $18,000 to $30,000 per mile, McRae said. &quot;Many carriers are developing new technologies (wireless) to help drive down the cost of buildout to make it a more cost-effective endeavor in the rural portions of the state,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more recent <a href=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2018/db0202/FCC-18-10A1.pdf\">FCC report on broadband deployment</a>, released this month, found that 71.9 percent of rural Georgians had access to fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, suggesting 28.1 percent did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new report also looked at populations&rsquo; access to mobile internet, but said it was not establishing a benchmark for mobile, as it does for fixed services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While both fixed and mobile services enable access to information and entertainment, there are notable differences between the two technologies and limitations in the FCC&rsquo;s data collection, the report said. Mobile broadband speeds can vary based on capabilities of consumers&rsquo; devices and transmissions can be subject to environmental factors that fixed services may not face, the FCC said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, FCC reports have shown that rural communities tend to be at a disadvantage in receiving high-speed internet. PolitiFact Missouri found that Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2017/sep/15/roy-blunt/roy-blunt-points-out-serious-lack-internet-infrast/\">accurately claimed</a> in September 2017 that nearly 2/3 of rural Missourians don&rsquo;t have access to broadband.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Kemp said that in in Georgia, &quot;25 percent of rural residents&quot; are &quot;without access to high-speed internet.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kemp&rsquo;s claim is backed by data reported by the FCC in 2016. New data shows that the percentage of rural residents without access to fixed terrestrial broadband is 28.1 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Kemp&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-09T14:58:29.608709", "ruling_date": "2018-02-12T10:22:28", "ruling_headline": "Do 25 percent of rural Georgia residents lack high-speed internet?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-25-percent-rural-georgia-lack-access-high-spe", "ruling_link_text": "FCC data backs the claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Brian Kemp, <a href=\"http://www.kempforgovernor.com/sites/default/files/A%20New%20Day%20in%20Rural%20Georgia.pdf\">campaign website for Georgia governor</a>, accessed Feb. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Ryan Mahoney, Brian Kemp&#39;s campaign spokesman, Feb. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Communications Commission,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2018/db0202/FCC-18-10A1.pdf\">2018 Broadband Deployment Report,</a> Released Feb. 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Communications Commission,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-16-6A1.pdf\">2016 Broadband Progress Report</a>, Released Jan. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview,&nbsp;Eric McRae, associate director of the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia, Feb. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Communications Commission,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/general/types-broadband-connections\">Types of Broadband Connections</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/connected\">Getting Broadband</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia House of Represenatives,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.house.ga.gov/Committees/en-US/HouseRuralDevelopmentCouncil.aspx\">House Rural Development Council</a>, May&nbsp;2017 meeting</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Missouri,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2017/sep/15/roy-blunt/roy-blunt-points-out-serious-lack-internet-infrast/\">Roy Blunt points out a serious lack of Internet infrastructure in Missouri</a>, Sept. 15, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Secretary of State", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Brian", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 460, "last_name": "Kemp", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "brian-kemp", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/briankemp.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/460/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>In Georgia, &quot;25 percent of rural residents&quot; are &quot;without access to high speed internet.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "campaign website", "statement_date": "2018-02-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 115, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/115/", "subject": "Technology", "subject_slug": "technology", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ".@BrianKempGA says 25 percent of rural Georgia residents don't have high-speed internet.
