News24fresh.info&rsquo;s website does not list any information identifying its mission statement, who runs it or who&rsquo;s behind it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the website does accurately note that the recall involves Hatch &amp; Grow Easter Eggs, Easter Grow Toys (with model number 234-25-1200 on the back of the packaging) and Hatch Your Own Dino (with model number 234-09-0016 on a label inserted in the packaging).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website also has the right description of the potential health problems and complications that can happen if a child ingests the toy; that surgery may be required to retrieve it from the body; and that it may not show up on an X-ray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The approximate amount of toys sold &mdash; 560,000 &mdash; its estimated $1 price tag and Target&rsquo;s offering of a full refund due to the recall is also accurate, matching <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2017/target-recalls-water-absorbing-toys\">announcements</a> <a href=\"http://help.target.com/help/targetguesthelpprarticledetail?articleId=ka0i0000000T1XeAAK&amp;articleTitle=Target+Water+Absorbing+Toys&amp;newsSafetyParCat=news+%26+safety&amp;productRecallCat=Product+recalls&amp;searchQuery=search+help\">posted</a> by Target and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Target also told PolitiFact that the recalls in the news24fresh.info post were all from last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission told PolitiFact that generally there&rsquo;s no end date to recalls, unless there&rsquo;s an update about a company no longer being in business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumers can still follow up on Target&rsquo;s 2017 recall for the described Easter egg toys, the commission said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Target did issue a recall for Easter egg toys.
