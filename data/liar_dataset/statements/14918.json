It was the first time federal judges have struck down congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Carolina has been at the center of election map battles since 2011, when some sued the state for what they called unfair congressional and legislative maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision drew swift rebukes from Republican lawmakers and organizational leaders. Some said they&rsquo;ll appeal and some questioned a judge&rsquo;s impartiality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robin Hayes, chairman of the N.C. GOP, issued a statement suggesting that the judges&rsquo; understanding of gerrymandering is warped. Hayes focused on geographic shapes, noting that the ill-fated maps kept 87 of North Carolina&#39;s 100 counties whole and divided only 12 precincts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A &lsquo;gerrymander&rsquo; is by definition and common understanding, a strange looking &lsquo;monster&rsquo; drawing. This map is clearly not that,&quot; Hayes said in a Jan. 10 statement. &quot;Judge Wynn is not being a judge, he is acting as a pundit by trying to impose his liberal beliefs instead of making a judicial ruling.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The origin of the term</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term &quot;gerrymandering&quot; comes from the 1800s, when a critic of newly-drawn election maps compared one of the districts to a salamander. And Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the N.C. GOP, referenced the term&rsquo;s origins when he emailed PolitiFact to explain Hayes&rsquo; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is important to note that this definition accompanied an &lsquo;eye&rsquo; test,&quot; Woodhouse said. &quot;In other words the meaning of the word came WITH a illustration that showed a bizarre looking districts, something many people would object to just based on how they look.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hayes and Woodhouse share the view of state Senate leader Phil Berger, who falsely claimed last year that North Carolina has the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/oct/05/phil-berger/berger-says-nc-has-strictest-anti-gerrymandering-s/\">strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the country</a>.&quot; Berger&rsquo;s argument, like the N.C. GOP&rsquo;s, was based on the idea that compact districts that keep counties intact are therefore fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While initial claims of gerrymandering focused on district shapes, and experts say district shapes can be an indicator of gerrymandering, they aren&rsquo;t the lone test of whether something is gerrymandered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The history of using gerrymandering to partisan advantage goes all the way back to the original use of the term for tilting state senate districts in Massachusetts,&quot; said Moon Duchin, associate professor of mathematics and Senior Fellow at Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These days, with incredibly rich data available to the line-drawers, very skewed districts no longer have to look like exotic reptiles with fangs and claws,&quot; Duchin said in an email. &quot;The current map in North Carolina is a great example &ndash; it is an extreme outlier, more favorable to Republicans than 99.5% of maps produced by a neutral process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Types of gerrymandering</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three main types of gerrymandering, as explained <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/cards/gerrymandering-explained/what-is-gerrymandering\">by Vox</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s partisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts to favor one party. (On Tuesday, judges ruled that North Carolina&rsquo;s congressional maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders meant to favor Republicans.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s racial gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that dilute the influence of a particular race or community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s even bipartisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that protect incumbents in both parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The North Carolina court adopted the same definition of partisan gerrymandering as the Supreme Court: a district plan that aims to benefit a particular party and in fact does so severely, durably, and unjustifiably,&quot; said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor from the University of Chicago. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That North Carolina&#39;s districts are not as ugly as in previous years is neither here nor there. You can obviously have nicer-looking districts that still intentionally and dramatically favor one side over the other,&quot; Stephanopoulos said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/?utm_term=.038a1c4a03ec\">this explanation</a> by the Washington Post, which includes a helpful graphic, for a visual representation of Stephanopoulos&rsquo; argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephanopoulos and Eric McGhee, a public policy fellow at University of California-Berkeley, created a new measure known as the &quot;efficiency gap&quot; -- the difference between the two parties&#39; wasted votes, divided by the total votes cast -- which is a focal point in the partisan gerrymandering case from Wisconsin that was<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/politics/gerrymandering-supreme-court-wisconsin.html\"> argued at the U.S. Supreme Court </a>in October. (Wasted votes are when voters are shifted into districts where their votes won&rsquo;t matter, either because their party&rsquo;s candidate can&rsquo;t win or is already sure to win.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McGhee said the courts haven&rsquo;t cemented district shapes as a requirement of gerrymandering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, so I can&rsquo;t give a legal opinion,&quot; McGhee said in an email. &quot;But the question of whether a gerrymander requires funny-shaped (&quot;non-compact&quot;) districts is not a matter of settled law or definition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said defenders of the Wisconsin assembly and NC congressional maps have argued that non-compactness is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But the lower courts have not been sympathetic so far. [It] remains to be seen what SCOTUS will say,&quot; McGhee said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duchin noted that there are three high-profile cases where courts plan to explore methods for measuring partisan gerrymandering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;None of them emphasizes district shapes,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the shapes of NC&rsquo;s congressional districts and whether they resemble monsters, some Washington Post reporters say they see not only ghastly images&nbsp;&ndash; but also at least one squirrel, dog and Sherlock Holmes, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2018/01/10/what-gerrymandering-every-north-carolina-district-just-happens-to-look-like-a-monster/?utm_term=.dd3cf18e5ead\">among other things</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hayes said a gerrymander is &quot;by definition and common understanding, a strange looking &lsquo;monster&rsquo; drawing,&quot; insinuating that North Carolina&rsquo;s Republican-drawn maps can&rsquo;t be gerrymanders if the districts have smooth edges and look nice. While he&rsquo;s right that weird shapes can be indicators of gerrymanders, shapes are not the lone determining factor. And there&rsquo;s more than just one definition of gerrymandering.
