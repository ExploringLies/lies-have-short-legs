Trump has been steadfast on his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/26/how-trump-plans-build-wall-along-us-mexico-border/\">plans to build a wall</a> along the southwest border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kaine is oversimplifying Trump&rsquo;s most-recent deportation priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Trump got to point No. 3 of his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/31/heres-what-donald-trump-said-in-his-big-immigration-speech-annotated/?platform=hootsuite\">immigration plan</a>, he said there would be &quot;zero tolerance for criminal aliens.&quot; He said that according to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens inside the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, talking specifically about criminal immigrants in the country illegally, said his administration would begin moving them out &quot;day one,&quot; working especially with police and law enforcement who &quot;know who these people are.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can&#39;t do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, <strong>those people are gone.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn&#39;t like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. <strong>They&#39;re gone.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. <strong>They&#39;re going to be gone.</strong> It will be over. They&#39;re going out. They&#39;re going out fast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump did not say, as Kaine quoted, &quot;they will all be gone,&quot; in reference to all people in the country illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in other parts of the speech, Trump stressed that non-criminal immigrants living in the United States illegally would also eventually have to return to their home countries and apply for re-entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign pointed to part of Trump&rsquo;s speech in which he said after accomplishing his enforcement and deportation goals, including the construction of the wall, &quot;then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Clinton&rsquo;s team pointed us to other parts of that speech where Trump said, &quot;Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation.&quot; Trump went on to emphasize his priorities, including criminals, gang members and security threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine said, &quot;When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said &lsquo;no, we&#39;re building a wall and we&#39;re deporting everybody.&rsquo; He said, quote, &lsquo;They will all be gone.
