Of these bills, four were budget bills that would have defunded Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only the budget bills from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/96/text\">2015</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/27/text\">2016</a>&nbsp;mentioned protections for pre-existing conditions by saying the protections should be included in any future health care reform. Since these bills didn&rsquo;t provide a clear path to offering protections, people with pre-existing conditions could have been vulnerable until other health care legislation passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two budget bills from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/45/text?r=1\">2013</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/596\">2014</a>&nbsp;were full repeals of Obamacare, and did not promise protections for pre-existing conditions. Any full repeal of Obamacare would also fully repeal these protections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that budget bills are not binding on policy, so it does not mean a vote for these will automatically repeal or defund Obamacare</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One bill would have prevented the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing any of the tax mandates necessary for funding Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.Holding also voted in favor of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3762\">reconciliation</a>&nbsp;bill, which is a budget bill that does not allow for filibusters in the Senate. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit with a focus on health policies,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://files.kff.org/attachment/Summary-of-the-Restoring-Americans-Healthcare-Freedom-Reconciliation-Act-of-2015\">notes</a>&nbsp;that this bill does not allow insurers to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/person/timothy-s-jost\">Tim Jost</a>, a law professor at Washington and Lee University, said in an email that this reconciliation bill would not have fully repealed Obamacare or protection for those with pre-existing conditions. That doesn&rsquo;t mean things would&rsquo;ve stayed the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;[The repeal] would have made it much harder for people with lower incomes to afford coverage for pre-existing conditions,&quot; Jost said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Holding&rsquo;s defense</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these votes came while President Barack Obama was in office, and Congress had no chance at successfully repealing Obama&rsquo;s signature health legislation. The Republicans were well aware of that. Their repeal attempts were used to show they could organize as a party, and could get the job done if there was a Republican president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game changed when President Donald Trump was elected. The Republican-controlled Congress pushed out its first health care bill. It would&rsquo;ve fully repealed Obamacare and replaced it with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/text\">American Health Care Act</a>. On May 4, 2017, Holding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/all-actions?q=%7B%22roll-call-vote%22%3A%5B%22H%22%5D%7D\">voted for&nbsp;</a>this bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the debate, Holding cited his votes for the AHCA to prove he supported protections for people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I really do want to put this pre-existing conditions argument to rest. I voted to repeal Obamacare as many times as I was given an opportunity to vote for repealing Obamacare,&quot; Holding said. &quot;... Obamacare didn&rsquo;t work. The American Health Care Act would work, and it protects and gives coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/22/kathy-manning/fact-checking-kathy-mannings-ad-ted-budd-and-pre-e/\">fact check</a>&nbsp;found that the AHCA says insurers wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to limit access to health care for those with pre-existing conditions. It would&rsquo;ve cut back on protections, however, by allowing for insurers to raise premiums based on an individual&rsquo;s health status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our&nbsp;ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding voted numerous times on bills that affect the Affordable Care Act in some way. We found eight bills would have either affected protections for pre-existing conditions, or fully removed them. None of the budget bills Holding voted for were binding either, meaning they wouldn&rsquo;t have necessarily defunded or repealed Obamacare. Holding voted on two budget bills that promised protections in future health care reform, but they offered no replacement. When he did vote for a replacement, the AHCA, it would have allowed insurers to raise premiums for people based on their pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters&rsquo; Lab and PolitiFact.
