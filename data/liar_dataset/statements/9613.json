Attorneys for the owners had argued they should not be forced to provide certain kinds of contraception that they feel violate their religious freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision was criticized by Democrats, who argued it allows some companies to make a health care decision for their female employees -- including which forms of birth control are covered. For instance, under the decision, the pill is okay, but intrauterine devices and the morning-after pill can be turned down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, a Democrat running in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary for attorney general, laid out her concerns about the ruling in broad terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Giving corporations, executives and bosses the ability to make decisions about women&rsquo;s health care is deeply regrettable,&quot; she said in a <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=326457\">June 30, 2014 news release. </a>&quot;At some point in their lives, 99 percent of women use birth control. This decision seems to ignore that fact and side with corporations over women.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others have cited a similar figure, including President Barack Obama on Feb. 10, 2012 when he unveiled a compromise on birth control coverage in his health care bill that aimed to address concerns raised by the Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nearly 99 percent of all women have relied on contraception at some point in their lives &ndash;- 99 percent,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/10/remarks-president-preventive-care\">Obama said at a White House briefing</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Happ right that virtually all women rely on birth control at some point in their lives?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for backup, Happ&rsquo;s campaign directed us to a Feb. 14, 2013 report, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr062.pdf\">&quot;Contraceptive methods women have ever used: United States, 1982-2010,&quot; </a>published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report was based on interviews with 12,279 women between 2006 and 2010. Each woman was asked a series of questions about whether she or a partner had ever used each of more than 20 methods of contraception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of the report was to prepare national estimates on the use of contraception in the United States. Its conclusions were pretty straightforward:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Virtually all women of reproductive age in 2006&ndash;2010 who had ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime (99 percent, or 53 million women aged 15&ndash;44).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report said 88 percent of the women in that group have used &quot;a highly effective, reversible method such as birth control pills, an injectable method, a contraceptive patch, or an intrauterine device.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It added that the most common methods used were the male condom (93 percent), the pill (82 percent), withdrawal (60 percent), and the injectable Depo-Provera (23 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also said that the use of contraception had increased from 94.8 percent of sexually experienced women in 1982, to 98.2 percent in 1995 and 99.1 percent in 2006-2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the report is pretty clear when it comes to widespread use of contraception among sexually active women considered to be of reproductive age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Happ&rsquo;s claim was broader than that. She did not limit it to an age group, or qualify it as sexually active women, which the report did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means there are some problems with her claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, the report says that only 86.6 percent of the women surveyed ever had sex with a male, meaning 13.4 percent never did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar trends were found in previous CDC surveys. A <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad362.pdf\">2005 report </a>said that about 8.4 percent of the women included in a 2002 survey said they had never had sex with a man. That survey was of 7,643 women between the ages of 15 and 44.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Obama made his 2012 statement, <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/news/article/obama-refuted-cdc-report-not-true-99-women-have-used-contraceptives-139-have-never-had\">Cybercast News Service</a> noted that the 2010 CDC report found 13.9 percent of women surveyed never had sexual intercourse, a figure that&rsquo;s in line with the more recent study cited by Happ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how many women are we talking about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/population/age/data/2012comp.html\">2012 Census </a>, the United States had about 92 million women between the ages of 15 and 44, so the number of women who never had sex is just over 12 million women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also worth noting that the CDC report says says 93 percent of women reported using condoms, and 60 percent reported using withdrawal as a birth control method. Those figures help &nbsp;drive the conclusion that virtually all women use birth control at some point in their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither, of course, is provided by prescription -- the context in which Happ made her claim. So, that also serves to skew the numbers behind the point she is making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ said &quot;at some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s clear she was arguing that contraception use is widespread, and important for women who run the risk of getting pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in making the statement, Happ used an overly broad brush, applying what is true for a subset (sexually active women between 15 and 44) and applying it to a larger group (all women).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-17T15:35:42.911247", "ruling_date": "2014-07-18T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Susan Happ says at some point in their lives 99 percent of women use contraception", "ruling_headline_slug": "susan-happ-says-some-point-their-lives-99-percent-", "ruling_link_text": "Claim is broader than the data", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=326457\">Press Release</a>, Susan Happ campaign, June 30, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Josh Lease, spokesman, Susan Happ campaign, June 30, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/hobby-lobby-case-supreme-court-contraception.html\">&quot;Supreme Court rejects contraceptives mandate for some corporations,&quot;
