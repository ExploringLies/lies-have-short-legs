But in this case, the information is based on actual federal criminal hate crime charge against Frank Nucera, Jr., a former police chief of Bordentown, a New Jersey township.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website attributes the information to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/us/new-jersey-former-police-chief-hate-crimes/index.html\">CNN</a>, which reported about the case against Nucera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the case, according to the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/press-release/file/1007906/download\">federal criminal complaint</a> filed Oct. 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nucera frequently used racial epithets against African-Americans and called for violence against them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In or about November 2015, when Nucera suspected that a previously arrested African- American individual had slashed the tires of a police vehicle, Nucera stated to a subordinate officer:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I wish that n----- would come back from Trenton and give me a reason to put my hands on him, I&#39;m tired of them. These n------ are like ISIS, they have no value. They should line them all up and mow them down. I&#39;d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I&#39;m tired of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The incident that led to the charges occurred Sept. 1, 2016, when the Ramada Hotel called to report to police that two individuals had failed to pay for a hotel room the night before and had been swimming in the hotel pool that afternoon. The suspects, both African-Americans, were an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suspects resisted arrest, and one of the officers used pepper spray, but the suspects were ultimately subdued and handcuffed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the male suspect was no longer resisting, Nucera grabbed his head and slammed it into a metal doorjamb. Nucera also used his arm to strike the suspect&rsquo;s neck or head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within hours of the alleged assault, a police officer recorded Nucera making racially hostile statements regarding the suspects and African-Americans in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nucera retired as chief shortly after the federal government informed the New Jersey attorney general of the pending investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nucera appeared in court in November 2017. A federal grand jury indicted Nucera on Dec. 7 for allegedly violating a man&rsquo;s civil rights by using excessive force during an arrest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Nucera&rsquo;s lawyer and did not get a reply. In a Dec. 22, 2016 interview with FBI agents, Nucera denied touching the male suspect, according to the indictment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline stated, &quot;New Jersey police chief says black people &lsquo;have no value&rsquo; and should all be executed.&quot; A federal criminal complaint states that Nucera expressed those opinions; the case is pending. Because there hasn&#39;t been a final determination made by a court, we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-05T16:16:24.443105", "ruling_date": "2017-12-14T13:55:11", "ruling_headline": "New Jersey police chief said black people have 'no value' and that he'd like to be on firing squad", "ruling_headline_slug": "new-jersey-police-chief-said-black-people-have-no-", "ruling_link_text": "It's in the criminal complaint", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Truth Examiner, <a href=\"https://www.truthexam.com/2017/11/new-jersey-police-chief-says-black-people-no-value-executed/\">&quot;New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People &lsquo;Have No Value&rsquo; And Should All Be Executed,&quot;</a>&nbsp;Nov. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/us/new-jersey-former-police-chief-hate-crimes/index.html\">&quot;Former NJ police chief accused of espousing violence toward African-Americans,&quot;</a> Nov. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Justice press release, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/former-bordentown-township-police-chief-charged-hate-crime-and-use-excessive-force-during\">&quot;Former Bordentown Township Police Chief charged with hate crime and use of excessive force during arrest,&quot; </a>Nov. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Justice criminal complaint, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/press-release/file/1007906/download\">United States of America vs Frank Nucera, Jr. </a>Oct. 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Courier-Post</em>, <a href=\"http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/2017/11/01/former-bordentown-police-chief-charged-frank-nucera-hate-crimes/820483001/\">&quot;Former South Jersey police chief charged with hate crime,&quot; </a>Nov. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Matthew Reilly, spokesman for the U.S.Attorney&rsquo;s Office in New Jersey, Dec. 5, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4125, "last_name": "Truth Examiner", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "truth-examiner", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4125/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://truthexam.com"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;New Jersey police chief says black people &lsquo;have no value&rsquo; and should all be executed.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2017-11-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 130, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/130/", "subject": "Diversity", "subject_slug": "diversity", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
