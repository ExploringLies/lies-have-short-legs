For this fact-check, however, we wanted to focus on Trump&rsquo;s claim that the United States has spent $6 trillion on the wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found is that Trump confused what&rsquo;s been spent, and what is projected to be spent. That said, he&rsquo;s right to note the large cost of U.S. intervention in the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf\">estimated</a> in 2014 that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (mainly the cost of operations) had cost the United States about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; $686 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; $815 billion for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; $27 billion for Operation Noble Eagle, enhancing security at military bases</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; $81 billion for programs and activities not directly related to war operations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those figures only include direct expenditures. More comprehensive analyses show trillions of dollars in additional spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent Brown University study, for example, <a href=\"http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2016/Costs%20of%20War%20through%202016%20FINAL%20final%20v2.pdf\">pinned</a> the cost of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria at about $3.6 trillion from 2001 to 2016, using the $1.6 trillion operations costs as a baseline but also accounting for counterterrorism costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding in money appropriated for war spending and on homeland security in 2017, the total reaches $4.79 trillion. This figure also includes future obligations for veterans medical and disability costs ($1 trillion through 2053) as well as interest on borrowing for wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a specific breakdown from the study:</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p7uJuegp7IBtV3Rr6dYc0gp2fuArS-HWUus0suRrFjeaSZmGQz5Ztyf-qiWrTAgq6gkY4fLBVniZ2irqnr1I30x2PeL2CPW0wl_eGEAbW2-yWsOJ2cNc7Pr6UR85A9kWmd4gFE0p\" style=\"border:none; height:424px; width:578px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2013 Harvard University <a href=\"https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=8956&amp;type=WPN\">working paper</a> came up with an even higher cost: $4 trillion to $6 trillion for just Iraq and Afghanistan. Like the Brown study, the Harvard paper estimated that future medical care and disability benefits for veterans of these war will near $1 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Harvard paper also attributes $750 billion in Pentagon medical and personnel costs to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and also considers the cost of nation-building in the two countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the wars in the Middle East have cost $6 trillion dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money that&rsquo;s been spent with money that researchers say will be spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a $1 trillion difference or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
