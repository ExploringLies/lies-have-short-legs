John McCain. McCain won the Republican primary and went on to be re-elected in the general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a June 2016 radio interview, host Leibsohn said that while the economy is often the factor driving an election, in 2016, national security was the focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leibsohn asked Ward how to combat global terrorism and, &quot;What would you say should be our policy towards ISIS?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Ward</strong>: &quot;It&rsquo;s a huge, huge problem. I think that No. 1, we do have to have a president in the oval office, a commander in chief who has a strategy to win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;We can&rsquo;t continue with this strategy of go in and do nation building, try to spread democracy, and unfortunately we had that policy under George W. Bush as well. It isn&rsquo;t what traditional conservative foreign policy has been, which is restraint and realism. Those things need to be brought back into the process in the foreign policy arena. I think that we also, we have to be willing to decimate ISIS &ndash; not control them, not to curb their activities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Leibsohn</strong>: &quot;Not live with them, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Ward</strong>: &quot;Not live with them, not to empower them, certainly not to empower them, and I think it is going to take that strong commander-in-chief and then conservative reinforcements in both the House and Senate to make it happen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward referenced &quot;restraint and realism&quot; as needed for overall foreign policy, but she spoke differently of combating terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defend Arizona did not respond to PolitiFact&rsquo;s query by deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time Ward&rsquo;s &quot;restraint&quot; comment is used against her. &nbsp;A pro-McCain <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_nKCEg32EU\">ad in July 2016</a> also highlighted her &quot;restraint and realism&quot; response, with the narrator adding, &quot;When Americans are under attack, restraint won&rsquo;t destroy ISIS.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward&rsquo;s 2016 campaign spokesman Stephen Sebastian <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/azdc/2016/07/09/john-mccain-president-obama-afghanistan/86871910/\">told the Arizona Republic</a> in 2016 that Ward &quot;believes in Reagan&rsquo;s &#39;Peace Through Strength&#39; as well as &#39;realism and restraint&rsquo;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a military wife whose husband has served in Iraq, Dr. Ward said she will support military engagement &#39;only as a last resort when national security is clearly at stake, only when Constitutionally approved by Congress, and only when there is a real strategy for victory, not expensive occupations and endless nation-building,&quot; Sebastian then told the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A Defend Arizona ad said Ward, &quot;called for restraint in fighting terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2016 radio interview, Ward said &quot;restraint and realism&quot; needed to be brought back into U.S. foreign policy in the fight against terrorism, but Ward&rsquo;s comment did not stop there.
