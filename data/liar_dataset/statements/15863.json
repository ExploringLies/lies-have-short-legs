A state mandate would only impact the insurance companies regulated by Wisconsin and not those regulated at the federal level, creating an uneven playing field and driving up costs for consumers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-senators-heavily-support-cancer-drug-bill-no-vote-planned-b99225682z1-250499691.html\">The bill was opposed</a> by the Wisconsin Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group, as well as another trade group, the Alliance of Health Insurers, and individual insurers. <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/senate-panel-maneuver-prevents-cancer-drug-vote-b99223846z1-249805561.html/\">Insurers said</a> the measure would drive up costs on insurance premiums and make it harder for employers and consumers to afford coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the measure came to a vote in the Senate, Vukmir and GOP Sen.
