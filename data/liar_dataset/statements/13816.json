The story is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story says two &quot;private intelligence agencies&quot; have determined that several news leaks that have been damaging to the Trump administration &mdash; from plans for executive orders to internal fights with staff &mdash; likely came from the president&rsquo;s own phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But TheSeattleTribune.com is a website that makes up their stories, and is associated with another faux news site called AssociatedMediaCoverage.com. Their <a href=\"http://theseattletribune.com/disclaimer/\">disclaimer says the website</a> &quot;is a news and entertainment satire web publication&quot; and that all articles &quot;are fictional and presumably satirical news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the counter on the story is to be believed, this one has been viewed more than 171,000 times in less than a week.

It&rsquo;s even appropriated a Twitter hashtag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article claims #DitchTheDevice is an online effort by social media users to get Trump to quit using the phone. But really, that hashtag was formerly used to try to get people to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SurThrival/status/682990986537091075\">stop staring at their phones all day long</a> and enjoy life a little bit more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any event, that&rsquo;s what the hashtag means <em>now</em>, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ditchthedevice\">thousands of people have used it</a> while tweeting out TheSeattleTribune.com link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story keys off a maelstrom of news about <a href=\"http://time.com/4685574/sean-spicer-cell-phone-leak-crack-down/\">leaks from the White House</a>, combined with Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">penchant for tweeting</a> and his reported actual use of an <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316099-trump-still-uses-unsecured-android-phone\">unsecured Android phone</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this story?
