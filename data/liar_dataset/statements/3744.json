Rick Perry during his one-day trip to Texas, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday: &quot;Gov. Perry turned down our invitation to meet the president at the airport.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama spokesman Adam Abrams later told us that Carney was referring to the airport in El Paso, where Obama ventured before flying to Austin for political fundraisers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a White House <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/10/press-gaggle-press-secretary-jay-carney-aboard-air-force-one-en-route-el\">transcript, </a>when a reporter suggested Perry &quot;wanted a more substantial meeting&quot; and didn&rsquo;t want to travel across the state &quot;to discuss the wildfires and border security and all that,&quot; Carney replied: &quot;Again, we invited him to meet with the president, and he declined the invitation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Perry refuse to greet Obama in El Paso?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRewind: In August, the GOP governor experienced a <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7146152.html\">34-second handshake of a conversation</a> with the Democratic president at Austin&rsquo;s airport during which he attempted to hand him a letter urging closer attention to security along the U.S.-Mexico border. The letter was accepted by a White House adviser.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed confirmed that on Tuesday, the governor declined an offer from the White House to greet the president in El Paso. &quot;It would have been a 10-minute greeting,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, Nashed said, &quot;we did ask them if we could meet and greet the president later in Austin or if the president would be interested in&quot; taking a flying tour of wildfires that have hurt rural Texas. &quot;Unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t arrange anything,&quot; Nashed said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, Perry spokesman Mark Miner was <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2011/05/10/perry_turned_down_meeting_with.html\">quoted</a> in the<em> Austin American-Statesman</em>&rsquo;s Postcards blog as saying Perry &quot;wanted to meet with the president to discuss the wildfires and border security, not just shake his hand in a receiving line on a tarmac.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked how the governor passed the hours he could have spent journeying to and from El Paso, about 575 miles from Austin. Nashed, forwarding Perry&#39;s state schedule for that day, said he joined Jay Kimbrough, his former chief of staff and a favorite troubleshooter, in marking the anniversary of the severe wound <a href=\"http://www.purpleheartaustin.org/kimbrough.htm\">Kimbrough</a> endured as a Marine machine gunner in Vietnam in 1967. The two lunched in East Texas, she said, and joined a motorcycle ride to a <a href=\"http://www.heartsmuseum.com/heartsstory.php\">veterans museum</a> in Huntsville.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn May 12, as noted by the <em>Dallas Morning News</em>, Perry told interviewer Laura Ingraham that he didn&#39;t have time to fly to El Paso for a handshake. The newspaper said Perry told Ingraham, &quot;If he wanted to meet, I was in Austin. I would have been here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe White House did not comment on Perry&rsquo;s professed offer to meet in Austin, though emails between Perry&#39;s office and the White House confirm that Perry was invited to greet the president in El Paso and that a gubernatorial aide asked if it was &quot;an option&quot; for Perry to greet Obama in Austin &quot;since we are here.&quot; A White House aide replied: &quot;Unfortunately there won&#39;t be a tarmac greet in Austin.&quot; PolitiFact Texas obtained the emails through an open-records request.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur call? Perry declined to howdy the president in El Paso. However, Carney&rsquo;s response implies Perry flat refused to meet when an alternative meeting prospect was floated. We rate Carney&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-12T17:13:13.247473", "ruling_date": "2011-05-13T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "President Obama's press secretary says Rick Perry declined to meet president in El Paso", "ruling_headline_slug": "president-obamas-press-secretary-says-rick-perry-d", "ruling_link_text": "Perry aide suggested Austin alternative", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, Postcards blog entry, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2011/05/10/perry_turned_down_meeting_with.html\">&quot;Perry turned down offer to greet Obama in El Paso,&quot;</a> May 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Dallas Morning News</em>, Trailblazers blog entry, <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/05/rick-perrys-not-laughing-calls.html\">&quot;Rick Perry&#39;s not laughing, calls Obama a &#39;stand-up&#39; comic,&quot;</a>&quot; May 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOffice of Gov.
