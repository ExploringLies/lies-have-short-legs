One asked his opinion of a national single-payer health care plan <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/13/what-would-sen-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-bill-mean-you-obamacare/662362001/\">introduced</a> the previous day by U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bernie-s/\">Bernie Sanders</a>, who ran for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. The proposal is <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/09/12/baldwin-why-support-medicare-all-and-other-efforts-expand-health-coverage/657254001/\">prominently supported</a> by U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/tammy-baldwin/\">Tammy Baldwin</a>, D-Wis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy panned it, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The single-payer program was tried in Vermont, where Bernie Sanders is from. They had to scrap it, it was way too much money, they were going bankrupt.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out Vermont was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/may/25/healthcare-vermont\">first</a> <a href=\"http://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/05/23/california-just-got-the-price-tag-for-single-payer-health-insurance/\">state</a> to adopt single-payer legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the program wasn&rsquo;t going bankrupt when it was abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It couldn&rsquo;t. It had never been implemented at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What single-payer is, what is its appeal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking under single-payer, everyone, or at least most people, would get health coverage from the federal government (the single payer) and it would pay all the bills. Details can vary, of course. For example, Sanders&rsquo; national proposal would eliminate <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/bernie-sanders-single-payer-system-healthcare-bill/\">nearly</a> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-single-payer-20170917-story.html\">all</a> private insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Single-payer hasn&rsquo;t necessarily enjoyed widespread support. In 2014, during an interview on Milwaukee radio, four-time presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ralph-nader/\">Ralph Nader</a> said most Americans &quot;since Harry Truman days&quot; have supported single-payer health insurance. Our rating was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/14/ralph-nader/70-years-most-americans-have-supported-single-paye/\">False</a>. There were individual poll results dating back to 1945 indicating majority support, but overall the results were mixed, at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One issue is cost. As <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jul/21/how-expensive-would-single-payer-system-be/\">PolitiFact National reported</a>, Sanders has pegged the cost of his national single-payer plan -- &quot;no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies&quot; -- at $1.38 trillion per year. Other estimates are as much as double that amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But all of that involves single-payer at the national level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting back to Duffy, what happened in Sanders&rsquo; home state?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Vermont experience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vermont adopted single-payer legislation <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/05/vermont-becomes-first-state-pass-single-payer-health-care/351152/\">in 2011</a>. It required then-Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, to submit a detailed financial plan by 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the plan was abandoned in 2014 without ever being implemented, or even funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the two news articles Duffy&rsquo;s office cited to back up his statement make that clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. </strong>The introduction to a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2017/09/13/550757713/why-bernie-sanders-single-payer-health-care-plan-failed-in-vermont\">National Public Radio piece</a> that aired the day before Duffy&rsquo;s statement explains it was about &quot;why Vermont was unable to establish a single-payer health care system.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/author/linda-j-blumberg\">Linda Blumberg</a>, an Urban Institute health insurance and health reform expert, told NPR that leaders in Vermont determined the taxes needed &quot;would not be politically palatable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. </strong>A<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/single-payer-vermont-113711\"> December 2014 Politico article</a> said that when Shumlin, who was first elected in 2010 after running on single-payer, pulled the plug he &quot;admitted what critics had said all along: He couldn&rsquo;t pay for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found similar reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanderss-single-payer-health-care-plan-failed-in-vermont\">The Daily Beast</a> said Shumlin dropped single-payer after an estimate said it would cost $4.3 billion a year, almost the size of the state&rsquo;s entire $4.9 billion budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/18/vermont-ends-push-for-single-payer-health-care/?utm_term=.7dad645f5058\">The Washington Post</a> reported that Shumlin said he could not &quot;responsibly support&quot; an 11.5 percent payroll tax hike on all Vermont businesses and an income tax hike of up to 9.5 percent that his administration said would be required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing in the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1501050\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, Harvard University practice of public health professor <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/john-mcdonough/\">John McDonough</a> pointed out that the decision to drop single-payer was as much about politics as finances. While studies showed the taxes would have been high, they also showed that the plan was economically viable (as the <a href=\"http://www.cornellpolicyreview.com/rise-fall-vermonts-single-payer-plan/\">Cornell Policy Review</a> also noted). But when Shumlin barely was re-elected in 2014, as McDonough put it, &quot;a clear public mandate for his health care agenda was nowhere in evidence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s clear that cost was cited as the reason Vermont did not implement single-payer, even though it was predicted that the tax revenue would have made the program viable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not the same as single-payer being in place and then dumped because it was heading for bankruptcy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, no one knows how single-payer in Vermont would have performed had it been put in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy said Vermont had to &quot;scrap&quot; its single-payer health insurance program because it was &quot;going bankrupt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vermont adopted legislation for single-payer in 2011. But by 2014, Vermont&rsquo;s governor abandoned the plan, saying the tax increases it needed would have been too high. In short, single-payer in Vermont didn&rsquo;t go bankrupt; it was never even funded or implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Duffy&rsquo;s statement False.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-19T01:30:15.521868", "ruling_date": "2017-09-20T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Vermont single-payer was scrapped because it was going bankrupt?
