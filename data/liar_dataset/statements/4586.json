We thought Bachmann&rsquo;s remark during the debate had the same ring as others we&rsquo;ve checked, including <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jul/16/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-favorite-statistic/\">one</a> by Florida Senator Marco Rubio that &quot;40 cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed,&quot; as well as a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-said-were-borrowing-40-cents-every-dol/\">similar statement</a> by North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/feb/17/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-says-united-states-borrows-more-4/\">another</a> by Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell. We rated each of those True, as well as Bachmann&rsquo;s statement. However, an alert reader noticed that Bachmann&rsquo;s statement didn&rsquo;t match the others and told us we should have done our math differently. We looked again and found the reader is correct. We rated Bachmann&rsquo;s claim based on government spending when we should have based it on revenues. So we have fact-checked her statement again, published this new analysis, and kept the rating True.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. government is living on credit, spending more than it receives and borrowing to keep up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Rep. Michele Bachmann says we need to tighten our belts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in,&quot; Bachmann said during a Republican presidential debate on Oct. 11, 2011, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Congressional Budget Office has released preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2011, which ended Sept. 30. According to the CBO&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12461/2011_10_07_MBR.pdf\">chart</a>, the federal government had revenues of $2.3 trillion and expenditures of $3.6 trillion, leaving a deficit of $1.3 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo calculate Bachmann&rsquo;s figure of &quot;spending X percent more than what we take in&quot; -- the percent by which expenditures exceed revenues -- divide $3.6 trillion by $2.3 trillion. The answer: about 56 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo experts, one from the conservative Heritage Foundation and one from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, verified our math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you say that spending is xx percent more than revenues, then the ratio is spending over revenues. So if you take in $2 and you spend $3, then you&#39;re spending 150 percent of revenues or you&rsquo;re spending 50 percent more than you take in. That aligns with Bachman&#39;s language pretty closely,&quot; said JD Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our inquiry, but we suspect she was slightly off because she misstated a figure that has been cited by others in recent months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&#39;re borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend,&quot; Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said in January 2011 on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Scott Rigell, a Republican who represents Virginia&rsquo;s Second District, said in a February 2011 press release, &quot;We are a nation $14 trillion in debt and are borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose cases refer to the proportions of spending funded by taxes versus borrowing, said Richard Kogan of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Using the CBO&rsquo;s new numbers, the proportion is 36 percent -- pretty close to 40 cents on the dollar. But Bachmann&#39;s claim referred to revenues (&quot;what we take in&quot;), so 56 percent is the right number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann said, &quot;Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in.&quot; It turns out, she was actually lowballing the number. The correct percentage by which federal spending exceeded revenues in 2011 was 56 percent, not 40, but Bachmann&rsquo;s broader point is correct.
