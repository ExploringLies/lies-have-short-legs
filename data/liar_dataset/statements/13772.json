We found three pieces of legislation backed by Baldwin, none of which became law, that are possibilities in that they all pertained to gay students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Orientation surveys:</strong> In 2010, as a member of the U.S. House, Baldwin <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/23/glenn-grothman/gop-lawmaker-claims-senate-candidate-tammy-baldwin/\">introduced a bill</a> that would have required a federal agency to request sexual orientation data in health-related national surveys it does. But the bill did not have any requirement to teach children about gay sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bullying in schools:</strong> In 2015, Baldwin <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/311/cosponsors\">co-sponsored</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/311/text\">a bill</a> to require states to direct their local educational agencies to establish policies that prevent and prohibit bullying. The bill states that students have been singled out for bullying based on various factors, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Again, no requirement to teach about sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sex education: </strong>In 2016, Baldwin <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2765/cosponsors\">co-sponsored</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2765\">a bill</a> that would, among other things, require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to award grants for training teachers and staff to teach age-appropriate comprehensive sex education to elementary and secondary school students. For the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2765/text\">elementary students</a>, the teaching would be aimed at &quot;broadening student knowledge about issues related to human development, relationships, personal skills and sexual behavior, including abstinence.&quot; None of the grants could be given to programs that &quot;are insensitive and unresponsive to the needs of sexually active youth or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, that legislation provides financial incentives to teach sex education in a manner that is inclusive of gay students. But it&rsquo;s not a requirement. It&rsquo;s a grant program that school districts can choose to apply for. What&rsquo;s more, it is for elementary and high school students, not targeted at kindergarteners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the bill dictates the education be age appropriate, making it highly unlikely that 5-year-olds would be taught about sex acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restore American Freedom and Liberty says Baldwin &quot;wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group did not reply to our requests for information that would back the statement. And we could not find any evidence that Baldwin supports such a requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If information surfaces that was available when the group made its claim and it is relevant, we could reconsider this fact check. But in the meantime, we rate the statement False.</p> <div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"45113c33-e956-4f75-9611-f3845f841acd\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ClaimReview\"> <div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div> <div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"> <div itemprop=\"name\"><a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">Politifact</a></div> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com/mediapage/jpgs/politifact-logo-big.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact\" /> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\">4</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"bestRating\">6</div> <img style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-false.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" /> Politifact Rating: <div style=\"font-weight: bold\" itemprop=\"alternateName\"></div> </div> <div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\" itemprop=\"claimReviewed\">Says Tammy Baldwin \"wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!\"</div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\"> <div itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"> <div itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div itemprop=\"name\">Restore American Freedom and Liberty </div> <div itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Political action committee</div> </div> <img style=\"display:none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup__________________.jpg\" /> <div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\" itemprop=\"name\">In a fund-raising email</div> <div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Tuesday, February 21, 2017</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">02/21/2017</div> </div> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/27/restore-american-freedom-and-liberty/no-evidence-pacs-claim-tammy-baldwin-wants-require/\" itemprop=\"url\">Read More</a> <div style=\"float: right\"> <a href=\"#\">info</a> </div> </div> </div> </div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-22T12:41:59.258962", "ruling_date": "2017-02-27T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "No evidence for PAC's claim that Tammy Baldwin 'wants to require children' to 'learn about gay sex' ", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-evidence-pacs-claim-tammy-baldwin-wants-require", "ruling_link_text": "Wrong on many levels", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/daniel-bice/2017/02/16/bice-out--state-groups-cash-milwaukee-county-sheriff-david-clarke/97908224/\">&quot;Bice: Out-of-state groups cash in on Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke,&quot;</a> Feb. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman Scott Spector, Feb. 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denver Post, <a href=\"http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2013/01/24/colorado-republican-civil-unions-told/89319/#more-89319\">&quot;I told you so, says gay Colorado Republican on civil unions,&quot;</a> Jan. 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Examiner, &quot;Wisconsin Democrat warns GOP about making senator&#39;s sexuality a campaign issue,&quot; Feb. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress.gov,<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2765\"> &quot;Real Education for Healthy Youth Act of 2016,&quot;</a> accessed Feb. 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress.gov, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/311\">&quot;Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2015,&quot;</a> accessed Feb. 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Advocates for Youth director of communications Emily Bridges, Feb. 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, U.S. Rep.
