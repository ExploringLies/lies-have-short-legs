By May 16, the national debt could exceed the cap, causing the U.S. to default on its obligations, according to an April 5 <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/letter-to-congress.aspx\">memo</a> from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongress has raised the federal debt ceiling nine times in the past 10 years, according to a January 2011 <a href=\"http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31967_20100128.pdf\">report </a>from the Congressional Research Service. From 1997 to 2001, the debt ceiling remained steady at $5.9 trillion. In 2002, Congress approved raising the cap to $6.4 trillion and has raised it almost every&nbsp;year since as the debt has grown. Republicans have repeatedly said they will not vote to increase the cap again, unless there are measures to ensure future long-term cuts in spending. Democratic leaders have argued that the increase is necessary to avoid sending an already fragile economy back into a tailspin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn March 30, 2011, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio penned an opinion piece for the <em><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704425804576220670543010068.html\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> explaining why he does not plan to support raising the debt ceiling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I will vote to defeat an increase in the debt limit unless it is the last one we ever authorize and is accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the article, Rubio wrote that, &quot;Leaders of both parties have grown our government for decades by spending money we didn&#39;t have. To pay for it, they borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today&#39;s $14 trillion debt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were curious if Rubio was correct -- is the U.S. borrowing $4 billion a day to run the government?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRubio spokesman Alex Burgos offered the following explanation in an e-mail as to how the senator arrived at the $4 billion figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our budget deficit this year is roughly $1.5 trillion, according to the Congressional Budgeting Office. 1.5 trillion/365 = roughly $4 billion per day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe explanation seems rather straightforward, but throughout Rubio&rsquo;s <em>Wall Street Journal </em>piece, there is only mention of the national debt, not the deficit that he uses to calculate the $4 billion figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the two terms are linked, they are not interchangeable. So we decided to reach out to several economists to get their expert take on Rubio&rsquo;s mathematics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a primer on the differences between the &quot;national deficit&quot; and the &quot;national debt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe deficit is the result of the government spending more&nbsp;in a single budget year than it takes in as revenue from taxes and other sources. The deficit in 2010 was $1.293 trillion, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals\">according to the website of the Office of Management and Budget</a>, and we&#39;ve had a deficit every year&nbsp;since 2002. Before that, from 1998 to 2001, for a brief period at the end of President Bill Clinton&#39;s term and the start of President George W. Bush&#39;s administration, the federal government was actually operating with a surplus, according to the Congressional Research Service report previously mentioned.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe national debt, meanwhile,&nbsp;is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money. <a href=\"http://politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/apr/11/saxby-chambliss/senators-ring-alarm-about-4-billion-debt-problem/\">Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia looked at a similar $4 billion-a-day claim </a>recently&nbsp;and described the&nbsp;debt this way:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion (as of&nbsp;April 6). The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm\">The national debt stretches back to the founding of the country</a>. It was $75 million in 1791, passed $1 billion in 1862 during the Civil War, and topped $1 trillion for the first time in 1982 during President Ronald Reagan&#39;s first term. You can see the federal debt at the U.S. Treasury Department&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm\">Bureau of the Public Debt</a> website. For the yearly federal budget deficits (and occasional surpluses) back to 1901, see the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals\">Office of Management and Budget&#39;s website</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The debt is the sum of all past deficits,&quot; said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida&#39;s Institute for Economic Competitiveness.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When you run a deficit, that adds to your outstanding debt,&quot; Snaith explained in a phone interview. The deficit &quot;drives the other one higher. If we didn&#39;t run deficits, than we could reduce the debt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSnaith said Rubio&rsquo;s numbers seemed legitimate, though they likely wouldn&rsquo;t be routinely used by economists.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The actual borrowing doesn&rsquo;t occur every day,&quot; Snaith explained. &quot;The periodic auction of bonds, that&rsquo;s when the money is raised. But when you&rsquo;re dealing with a figure like $1.5 trillion, it&rsquo;s like a light year, it doesn&rsquo;t register for many people. To make it a bit more comprehensible, they probably tried to bring it down to a level that is easier to visualize.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also turned to David Denslow, an economist with the University of Florida&rsquo;s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Denslow reminded us of another way the deficit and debt are linked: Every year that we have a deficit, the debt grows larger and we have to pay more interest on that debt. &quot;What we worry about it the accumulating interest,&quot; he said in an e-mail, referring to it as a &quot;secondary deficit.&quot; He warned, &quot;The effect starts out slow, but becomes explosive.&quot; As we noted, interest on the debt&nbsp;was more than $400 billion in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile Denslow agreed with the mathematics behind Rubio&rsquo;s statement, he still suggested the wording could be clearer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The phrasing is a bit misleading.&nbsp;I would phrase it, &#39;To pay for it, they are now borrowing $4 billion a day, raising the debt to $14 trillion,&rsquo;&quot; Denslow wrote in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo&nbsp;two experts&nbsp;agree with Rubio&rsquo;s $4 billion a day figure but&nbsp;quibble over the&nbsp;phrasing. Still, we&nbsp;wondered if it was accurate to refer to deficit spending&nbsp;&quot;for decades&quot; and justify it with the deficit over the most recent 365 days. After all, using the OMB list of&nbsp;deficits in the past 10 years, it was $3.5 billion a day in 2010, $1.25 billion a&nbsp;day in 2008 and $680 million a day in 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe posed the question to Marc Goldwein<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In terms of when the deficits were created, of course deficits are the result of a variety of tax and spending decisions -- some which have been made in the last few weeks, some which were made in the 1930s,&quot; Goldwein said. &quot;But, when the decision is made is a different question from when the money is borrowed. It is being borrowed now.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGoldwein&#39;s assessment: Rubio&#39;s description &quot;seems to me to be more or less true on average.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, not quite a ringing endorsement. Rubio&#39;s statement was that, to pay for government growth over decades, leaders &quot;borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today&#39;s $14 trillion debt.&quot; The sentence mixes a breakdown of the deficit and a total for the debt, and the casual reader could easily confuse the two concepts. We think it would have been more accurate to say that leaders &quot;borrowed $4 billion a day<em> </em>last year to cover the deficit, pushing today&#39;s debt to&nbsp;$14 trillion.&quot;&nbsp;Still, the senator&rsquo;s calculation works, even though the money isn&#39;t really borrowed every single day.&nbsp;Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-12T10:31:37.030065", "ruling_date": "2011-04-15T09:54:54", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
