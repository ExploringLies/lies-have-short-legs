David Cicilline&rsquo;s legal and legislative resume recently, pointing out unsavory law clients Cicilline represented as a criminal defense lawyer and criticizing him for votes that he took during his eight years in the Rhode Island House of Representatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an Oct. 9, 2012, news release, Doherty accused Cicilline, a freshman Democrat, of voting against two bills in the mid-1990s that would have imposed mandatory sentences for certain domestic violence and child abuse offenses. We examined Doherty&rsquo;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/15/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-us-rep-david-cicilline-when-h/\">and ruled it True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast week &nbsp;the Cicilline campaign &nbsp;decided two could play that game, releasing a television ad that labeled Doherty&rsquo;s attacks &quot;outrageous.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad cited anti-crime bills Cicilline supported in the legislature on behalf of women, the elderly and other victims of crimes, including cases of sexual abuse.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check Cicilline&rsquo;s list, checking Journals of the Rhode Island House, state statutes, and our own news files. We found that the ad accurately cited the legislation and Cicilline&rsquo;s votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first involved crimes against the elderly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1998, Cicilline was among a group of legislators who supported a bill called the Elderly Violence Protection Act. It established that particular crimes should be charged differently if they were committed against a victim older than 60. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn July 14, 1998, he made a motion, which was approved, to add breaking and entering to that list. &nbsp;He was the only one of the group of sponsors or seconders to discuss the act on the floor. It passed on a 69-3 vote and ultimately became law.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tIn the 2000 legislative session, Cicilline proposed legislation that would have created a crime of indecent solicitation of a child under 14 for the purpose of sexual molestation. It didn&rsquo;t pass that year. But in 2004, two years after Cicilline had left the state House for the Providence mayor&rsquo;s office, a similar bill was enacted, though it set the age at 18, rather than 14.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next year Cicilline introduced a bill that would have eliminated the statute of limitations for lawsuits filed by victims of child sexual abuse. The existing law said someone so harmed had seven years to file a suit. The bill didn&rsquo;t pass and the seven-year limit remains in effect today.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2002, he submitted a bill that would have prohibited anyone who has been the subject of a restraining order from owning firearms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe existing law forbade people who had been convicted of a crime of violence, a felony or who were under home confinement from owning a gun. The bill didn&rsquo;t pass.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCicilline campaign TV ad says Cicilline, as a state representative, voted for tougher anti-crime bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe verified that Cicilline supported the bills cited in the ad, though not all of them became law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find his statement True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\">PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
