According to its website, Hyperloop Technologies Inc.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hyperloop-one.com/facts-frequently-asked-questions\" target=\"_blank\">was established in Los Angeles in 2014</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Earlier this year, the company successfully tested its propulsion system with the car in the tube, and the company projects three Hyperloop systems will be completed by 2021.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Essentially, Hyperloop utilizes magnetic accelerators in a low-pressure tube system in order to propel rotors in individual capsules. The vehicles hover slightly off the track in the tube through magnetic levitation. This special environment allows a blazing top speed of 670 mph.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Missouri efforts</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In May 2016,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hyperloop-one.com/global-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperloop One opened its Global Challenge</a>, urging cities and regions around the world to submit their pitches for a Hyperloop network. More than 2,600 proposals were sent to Hyperloop. Missouri submitted its application that fall, and was named as one of the 35 semifinalists in February 2017.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We reached out to Hyperloop One officials, who didn&rsquo;t respond, and to the Missouri Department of Transportation. Special assignment coordinator Robert Brendel directed us to links about the challenge.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>On Sept. 14, 2017, Hyperloop announced its winners via a press release. Even though it didn&rsquo;t win, the Missouri route was designated as one of 11 finalists invited to continue developing the proposal.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In response to being named a finalist, state officials established the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition in October to continue the conversation.

Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd is featured in a short video about the potential for the transportation system in the state, which is available on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.makemohq2home.com/\" target=\"_blank\">state&rsquo;s Amazon HQ pitch website</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The video is sponsored by the state&rsquo;s Department of Economic Development, but the praise comes from Lloyd himself.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>McKenna said Hyperloop officials called the proposed route between Kansas City and St. Louis &quot;one of the best they&rsquo;ve ever seen.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The Hyperloop One CEO said the coalition proposed a great route.
