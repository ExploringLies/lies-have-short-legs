(A spokesman for the super PAC cited Trump&rsquo;s comments at the town hall and at a subsequent debate.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC&rsquo;s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/07/john-kerry-peace-between-israelis-palestinians-still-possible\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>efforts have failed </u></a>to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other&rsquo;s right to exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don&#39;t want to say whose fault is it. I don&#39;t think it helps.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About two weeks later at the debate in Houston, Wolf Blitzer asked Trump: &quot;How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America&#39;s closest ally in the Middle East?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump defended his record by saying that he had been grand marshall of the Israeli Day parade a few years ago and received awards from Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he said when negotiating a deal, it wouldn&rsquo;t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t help if I start saying, &#39;I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,&#39; &quot; Trump said, adding that he can&rsquo;t negotiate as well if he takes sides. &quot;With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump&rsquo;s additional comments about Israel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December, Trump told the Associated Press that he doubted the commitment of Israelis and Palestinians to the peace process. But he suggested the big lift may have to come from Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel&#39;s willing to sacrifice certain things,&quot; Trump said. &quot;They may not be, and I understand that, and I&#39;m okay with that. But then you&#39;re just not going to have a deal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a &quot;huge sticking point&quot; in talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same week, when he spoke to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQYOvDmWqjo\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Republican Jewish Coalition</u></a>, Trump praised Israel by saying that the country has already &quot;given a lot&quot; but doesn&rsquo;t get credit for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He explained his strategy if elected:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t like to as a deal maker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I&rsquo;d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want one side or the other saying ... I think people know where I stand, okay?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said he would want to enter negotiations with a &quot;clean slate&quot; and the attitude of &quot;everybody is even, we love everybody, let&rsquo;s see if we can do something.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also reminded Jewish Republicans that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am a big fan of Israel,&quot; Trump said in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>video endorsement</u></a>. &quot;And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his own campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled the trip after Netanyahu faced&nbsp;backlash after Trump&rsquo;s comments about Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, &quot;I haven&rsquo;t been working too much with the Arab leaders.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s rhetoric is notable on Israel because it is &quot;cooler and more detached&quot; than his GOP rivals, wrote <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/02/22/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-the-mideast-peace-deal/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Aaron David Miller</u></a>, a former adviser to Republican and Democratic secretaries of state on Arab-Israeli negotiations who now works for the Woodrow Wilson Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while Trump has said he can be a better negotiator if he appears neutral, he has made several comments that suggest he has closer ties to Israelis than Palestinians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s spokespersons did not respond for this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A PAC that supports Rubio says Trump &quot;says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has said that in order to negotiate between Israelis and Palestinians he can&rsquo;t take sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let me be sort of a neutral guy,&quot; he said at a town hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the ad omits that Trump has had ties to Israel for years -- he has called himself &quot;pro-Israel&quot; and endorsed Netanyahu&rsquo;s re-election in 2013.
