David Furhman, the senior director of Emory&rsquo;s Food Service Administration, told the Wheel that the decision to remove Chick-fil-A was not spurred by the Cathy controversy. It was, he said, based solely on student feedback from surveys and focus groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;What we learned was that there was no great affinity or love for Chick-fil-A,&quot; Furhman said in a March 12 article in the Wheel. &quot;It was more of an affinity or love of the convenience, and what students also told us was that they didn&rsquo;t really love Chick-fil-A.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia wondered: Was Emory&#39;s decision triggered solely by focus-group feedback?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd we wanted to know what that feedback included.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe conflict began when Cathy discussed same-sex marriage in a July 2012 interview.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I think we are inviting God&#39;s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, &#39;We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,&#39;&quot; Cathy said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCritics called for boycotts. Supporters rallied to Cathy&rsquo;s defense, organizing a &quot;Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day&quot; that packed eateries.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChick-fil-A, which began in metro Atlanta and is headquartered here, did not respond to an interview request.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tEmory groups, including gay rights organizations and the Student Government Association, formally requested the removal of Chick-fil-A after the controversy began. Senior Director and Dean of Campus Life Ajay Nair released a statement saying the university wouldn&rsquo;t remove the eatery based on Cathy&rsquo;s comments.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut in February, the university and a student committee called FACE (Food Administration Committee Emory) said they were going to review all campus food venues, including Chick-fil-A.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFurhman told the Wheel that the examination of the campus food venues where Chick-fil-A is located predated the controversy. But both student co-chairs of FACE contradicted that. They said the review plan began when Furhman joined Emory in January.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact contacted Furhman, who referred all inquiries to Campus Communications. He declined to answer our questions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNair said in the Wheel: &quot;Through (dialogue over Chick-fil-A), we also learned that a re-visioning of dining at Emory could foster a separate, positive community change, while addressing students&rsquo; concerns around their dining experiences.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne student co-chair of the food committee, Karoline Porcello, told the Wheel the restaurant&rsquo;s values were a contributing, but not deciding factor in its removal. In an email, Porcello clarified that those values referred to &quot;human development values&quot; such as physical well-being, not political values.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Campus Communications, Porcello said: &quot;We&#39;ve received strict instructions by Emory to no longer comment on the issue.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMichael Sacks, another co-chair, said the removal was not political.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s kind of unfortunate that people very easily jump to the conclusion that Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s political views were the reason we got rid of them, but that was not our intention at all,&quot; Sacks told WSB Radio.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe process reviewed each venue according to six criteria, including consistency with the campus life department&rsquo;s core values and survey data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe committee held open monthly meetings and focus groups with more than 30 volunteer attendees who answered FACE&rsquo;s questions. In all three of the monthly meeting documents on the FACE website, Chick-fil-A was not mentioned.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSacks sent over three of the four focus groups&rsquo; minutes. He said that he was told that the last meeting &quot;did not present much opportunity for note-taking.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe three focus group minutes didn&rsquo;t conclusively show a distaste for Chick-fil-A. Some attendees said they eat at Chick-fil-A often while others showed distaste for the venue. One document even said &quot;Keep Chick-fil-A&quot; in the summary box.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPorcello said some focus group members wanted to remove Chick-fil-A for health reasons and that some said they only liked the convenience of the venue. The documents provided to PolitiFact Georgia didn&rsquo;t confirm those claims. Porcello didn&rsquo;t respond to requests to do so.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a March meeting, the food committee put three floor plans up for a vote. None of the plans included Chick-fil-A or Pizza Hut. Sacks said that decision was based on the focus groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUltimately, the redesign will replace Chick-fil-A with a pizza and pasta venue, expand Mexican food and salad areas and create a grab-and-go station and a coffee and bakery area. The committee chairs said the university will remove Pizza Hut as well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDena Smith, Emory&rsquo;s senior communication officer, sent PolitiFact a link to a March 12 Campus Life statement indicating that Emory would announce a final Chick-fil-A decision soon. She said Emory would consider FACE&rsquo;s input, which does not include &quot;a chicken restaurant.&quot; This statement was released the same day that the Wheel and WSB Radio published their stories about the venue&rsquo;s closure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact contacted 15 Emory political science professors for a comment. None wanted to weigh in on the controversy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint says that it is difficult to believe that the decision wasn&rsquo;t political. He said that Emory&rsquo;s role as &nbsp;&quot;ground zero&quot; of the Chick-fil-A debate may have something to do with its defense.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m not saying that it isn&rsquo;t true,&quot; Swint said, &quot;But I work on a college campus ... and I can tell you that Chick-fil-A is probably the most popular dining option (on my campus).&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur conclusion:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn Emory administrator said that a proposal to remove Chick-fil-A from a campus dining hall was not politically motivated but was instead based on focus groups. Campus officials have offered conflicting statements about Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s future.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact rules require the person making the statement to provide the proof to back it up. Furhman and Emory failed to do so.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere apparently was an objective process that reviewed all food vendors, but only incomplete documentation was provided. That documentation didn&rsquo;t confirm any of the sources&rsquo; claims. And the final redesign plan doesn&rsquo;t indicate the committee was concentrating on health concerns. It &nbsp;wants to remove Chick-fil-A, but plans call for a proposed pizza and pasta joint and expanded Mexican food areas. Not exactly healthy alternatives.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rated the claim Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Karishma Mehrotra is a journalism major at Emory University who is completing an internship with PolitiFact Georgia. She is also an editor at The Emory Wheel but took no part in the Chick-fil-A news coverage.)</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-04-18T17:32:19.262872", "ruling_date": "2013-04-19T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Emory says Chick-fil-A decision not political", "ruling_headline_slug": "emory-says-chick-fil-decision-not-political", "ruling_link_text": "Half-cooked", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Emory Wheel, <a href=\"http://www.emorywheel.com/face-holds-open-meeting-discusses-food-venues/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">&quot;FACE Holds Open Meeting, Discusses Food Venues,&quot;</a> Feb 8, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Emory Wheel, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.emorywheel.com/students-protest-emory-chick-fil-a/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Students Protest Emory Chick-fil-A</a>,&quot;
