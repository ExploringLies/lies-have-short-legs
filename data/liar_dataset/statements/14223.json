Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear,&quot; the uncorrected editorial read. &quot;Before the shooting, Sarah Palin&rsquo;s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The editorial, penned amid the frenzy of the mass shooting, sought to connect the attack on GOP lawmakers with the 2011 Giffords shooting to make a broader point about politically motivated violence. The piece reasoned that the latest attack, which left the gunman dead and four injured, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R&ndash;La., was probably &quot;evidence of how vicious American politics has become,&quot; and that the shooter&rsquo;s derangement &quot;found its fuel in politics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The editorial ran into trouble when it turned its focus to the Giffords shooting, so we decided to explore why the connection between Palin&rsquo;s PAC and Loughner&rsquo;s motivation is problematic.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What we know about the Giffords shooters&rsquo; motivations</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/07/fast-facts-2011-tuscon-shooting/\">news reports</a>, Loughner became fixated on Giffords several years before his Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage that killed six and injured 14, including the Arizona congresswoman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loughner first met Giffords in 2007 at a community event where he asked her a question and was &quot;unsatisfied with her answer,&quot; CNN reported. It was at this point he developed a fixation for the lawmaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several years elapsed between the time Loughner first met Giffords and when Palin posted a note to Facebook that linked to her political action committee. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/sarah-palin/dont-get-demoralized-get-organized-take-back-the-20/373854973434\">PAC circulated</a> a map of House Democrats&#39; districts (not individual members) the GOP would seek to recapture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J6vnsyH7ybKuMyMw8caw-bGNTsbOHJKM6IAIhzA6sHV6l19nN-p7xv80wb55FXP8oHUG4pvWzXa0rhdULf2N14OEW7hLpl0aoJQTS5k-tirzCQmWaY9gqlpSOg8keIWCfBNjg3iu\" style=\"border:none; height:657px; width:403px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <em>Washington Post</em>, there is no evidence Loughner was aware of Palin&#39;s maps.
