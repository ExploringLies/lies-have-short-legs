The logo won a Silver Anvil Award of Excellence from the Public Relations Society of America, a top trade organization for the industry.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The campaign also introduced a new website and introduced the branding into designs for community service projects.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Clearly, FleishmanHillard&rsquo;s campaign was designed to rebrand The Mission Continues as a charity, not Greitens himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>This rebranding was covered by several major news outlets, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://abcnews.com/\">ABCNews.com</a>&nbsp;and Bloomberg News.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Charities have to market themselves so the people they want to help know about their services, said Daniel Borochoff, president and founder of Charity Watch.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a legitimate expense,&quot; Borochoff said. &quot;They can&rsquo;t do it in the dark.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>A representative from the Greitens campaign said the ad was a blatant misrepresentation of the reality of the expense.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In a TV ad, Koster said Greitens&rsquo; charity The Mission Continues spent $600,000 on image consultants.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>This amount was well-supported by non-profit Form 990s, which listed $619,599 in payment to PR firm FleishmanHillard.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The ad was misleading, however, when it suggested that the image consultants were used to craft Greiten&rsquo;s personal image, instead of The Mission Continues.
