But barely a month later, the Republican National Convention was replete with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=604&amp;q=rnc+build+that&amp;oq=rnc+build+that&amp;gs_l=img.3...1266.8498.0.8617.38.11.7.19.12.1.114.648.10j1.11.0...0.0...1ac.BpQnZ9FMj-4\">references</a>to Obama&rsquo;s &quot;you didn&rsquo;t build that&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jul/18/context-obamas-you-didnt-build-comment/\">comment</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong those sounding the theme from the Tampa, Fla., gathering was U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/27/reid-ribble/republican-house-candidate-reid-ribble-says-he-los/\">Reid Ribble</a>, R-Wis., a first-term congressman serving the Green Bay area.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring an Aug. 30, 2012 interview, Ribble and Jerry Bader, host of a conservative radio talk show on WTAQ-AM and -FM in Green Bay, talked for several minutes about the Obama comment. The interview was done the day after U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney&rsquo;s running mate, spoke to the convention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRibble said: &quot;What the president did build, though -- and (Ryan) talked about this last night -- is he built this $16 trillion debt. He did build that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWait. All of it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt first glance, Ribble&rsquo;s claim may appear way off. But let&rsquo;s examine the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>How much we owe</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s &quot;debt to the penny&quot; <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">meter</a> for the day Ribble made his statement. The debt was a few hairs under $16 trillion, although it crossed that threshold several days later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe then spun the meter back to Jan. 20, 2009, the day of Obama&rsquo;s inauguration. The debt was $10.6 trillion. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means debt rose $5.4 trillion under Obama -- about one-third of the $16 trillion total.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy saying Obama &quot;built this $16 trillion debt. He did build that,&quot; Ribble suggested Obama was responsible for the entire amount.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRibble spokeswoman Ashley Olson disagreed, saying it&rsquo;s obvious the $16 trillion accumulated over many years. Her boss&rsquo; point, she said, was that it reached $16 trillion because of Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut even if that was what Ribble meant in blaming Obama, he cited the $16 trillion debt figure, not the roughly $5 trillion accumulated during his presidency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Obama&rsquo;s role</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for what role Obama played in the accumulation of debt, Olson cited a number of news articles about how much debt and spending increased during Obama&#39;s time as president. Let&rsquo;s look at two of them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>1. &quot;Obama is the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat line is from PolitiFact National, although it is a bit dated. It&rsquo;s from May 2011, when our colleagues rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/19/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-posts-questionable-chart-debt-accumul/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=et&amp;utm_content=http%3a%2f%2fwww.politifact.com%2ftruth-o-meter%2fstatements%2f2011%2fmay%2f19%2fnanc\">Pants on </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/19/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-posts-questionable-chart-debt-accumul/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=et&amp;utm_content=http%3a%2f%2fwww.politifact.com%2ftruth-o-meter%2fstatements%2f2011%2fmay%2f19%2fnanc\">Fire</a>a claim by then-U.S. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that Obama &quot;increased the debt&quot; 16 percent while President George W. Bush raised it 115 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn saying Obama was the debt king among the last five presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan, PolitiFact National found that under one measure -- debt as a percentage of gross national product -- Obama ranked highest. As of December 2010, the ratio under Obama had risen nearly 22 percentage points; Reagan was second at 14.9.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(However, using raw numbers, our colleagues found that at the time, the debt had increased by 34 percent, or $3.66 trillion, under Obama -- well below the 86 percent increase, or a total of $4.9 trillion, under George W. Bush.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2. Obama budgets and spending up each year</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA May 2012 analysis by The Washington Post Fact Checker found that Obama&#39;s budgets have increased each year, from $3.27 trillion in 2009 to $3.65 trillion in 2012; and that Obama proposed more in spending each year than Congress ultimately approved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the debt has increased significantly under Obama. But, despite Ribble&rsquo;s claim, the responsibility goes far beyond the White House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Other factors</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said at the GOP convention that $5 trillion in debt had been added over the past four years, PolitiFact National rated his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-there-has-been-5-trillion-debt/\">Mostly True</a>. Our colleagues pointed out that while the figure was on target, the blame is bipartisan. Democrats had majorities in the Senate and House for two years of Obama&rsquo;s presidency, but Republicans have controlled the House since January 2011. Moreover, our colleagues noted, much of the debt stems from entitlement spending policies that were set under past presidents and Congresses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio made similar points in June 2012 when it rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/jun/27/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-obama-has-racked-more-debt-any-ot/\">Half True</a> a statement by Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, that debt under Obama had risen $5 trillion -- more than any other president.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur Buckeye colleagues noted that although Obama approved the stimulus bill and a deal to extend tax cuts, both of which contributed to the debt, Obama&rsquo;s administration has cited decisions made under GOP President George W. Bush -- including tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Medicare prescription drug program -- as major contributors to the debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRibble said Obama &quot;built this $16 trillion debt.&quot; His spokeswoman said Ribble meant that the debt had reached that level because of Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Ribble used the $16 trillion figure, not the roughly $5 trillion that the debt has increased under Obama. Moreover, the debt grew not only due to Obama&rsquo;s actions, but those taken by present and past presidents and Congresses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Ribble&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-06T16:47:30.370956", "ruling_date": "2012-09-12T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "President Obama 'built' nation's $16 trillion debt, GOP Rep.
