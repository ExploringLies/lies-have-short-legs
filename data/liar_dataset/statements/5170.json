Chris Christie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiddle-class families, meanwhile, won&rsquo;t save enough to stock their cabinets for a week.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Let&#39;s be clear about this - Gov. Christie&#39;s income tax plan may sound nice, but it would save a family earning $50,000 per year just $80.50 and a family earning $100,000 per year just $275, all [the] while ... millionaires get a $7,265.75 tax break,&quot; Greenwald (D-Camden) said in a Jan. 17 press release. &quot;Under this tax cut, middle-class families don&#39;t save enough for a week&#39;s worth of groceries, while millionaires save enough to go on an exotic vacation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services analyzed the impact of the governor&rsquo;s proposed income tax cut for the Assembly Democrats. The cut would be phased in over three years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSavings are estimated by reducing the amount of income tax joint filers pay by 10 percent. According to the analysis, a couple with a taxable income of $50,000 pays $805 in income tax now. Under Christie&rsquo;s proposal the same couple would pay $724.50, or $80.50 less.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA couple with a taxable income of $1 million pays $72,657.50 now. A 10 percent reduction in that bill equals $65,391.75, or $7,265.75 less, according to the analysis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJames R. Hines Jr., co-director of the law and economics program at the &nbsp;University of Michigan Law School, said it&rsquo;s fair to estimate the impact of an income tax rate cut by calculating the reduction in the tax bill. &quot;There&rsquo;s nuances but by and large, it&rsquo;s roughly right,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the proposed cut higher income filers benefit more than lower income filers. Hines said that&rsquo;s expected. Suppose you say &quot;the lion&rsquo;s share of the benefits go to the rich,&quot; he said. &quot;It tells you the lion&rsquo;s share of the taxes must be paid by the rich.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie also responded to that charge in a recent WNYC interview: &quot;Those folks who are paying more in a progressive system, when you cut those taxes are going to get more. That&#39;s the definition of a progressive system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Greenwald&rsquo;s numbers are reasonable, but what about his comparisons: Are savings under the proposed income tax cut too little to cover a week&rsquo;s worth of groceries for a middle-class family? And can a more than $7,000 tax break pay for an exotic vacation?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal data and a review of travel websites back the assemblyman up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreenwald based the grocery figure &quot;on paying bills and providing for a family in the real world, such as going to the supermarket for a week&rsquo;s worth of groceries to feed 3 growing kids, with healthy meals for breakfast lunch and dinner,&quot; according to a spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA family of four with school-age children on average spends between $233 and $283 a week on food with a moderate-cost to liberal meal plan, according to November 2011 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA two-week vacation for two, including airfare, accommodations, taxes and fees, from Newark to Fiji costs more than $7,500 in a package listed on the travel website Kayak.com. Expedia.com prices a similar vacation in Bali at about $5,800.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the governor announced his proposal to cut income tax rates by 10 percent, Greenwald said in a press release that the cut wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to pay for one week of groceries for a middle-class family, but millionaires would save enough to take an exotic vacation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreenwald is right: those who make more in New Jersey will save more from an across-the-board income tax cut. And federal data and vacation package deals listed on travel websites back up the assemblyman&rsquo;s comparisons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/politifact_new_jersey_lou_gree.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-19T17:17:51.087115", "ruling_date": "2012-01-22T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Lou Greenwald claims governor\u2019s proposed income tax cut benefits millionaires more than middle-class families", "ruling_headline_slug": "lou-greenwald-claims-governors-proposed-income-tax", "ruling_link_text": "Pay more, save more", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey Assembly Democrats, <a href=\"http://www.assemblydems.com/Article.asp?ArticleID=4951\">Greenwald: Governor&rsquo;s Plan Again Benefits Wealthy Over Middle-Class</a>, Jan. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/reactions_to_christies_state_o.html\">Reactions to Christie&#39;s State of the State address</a>, Jan. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Tom Hester Jr., communications director for the <a href=\"http://www.assemblydems.com/\">Assembly Democrats</a>, Jan. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/questions_surround_gov_christi.html\">Questions surround Gov.
