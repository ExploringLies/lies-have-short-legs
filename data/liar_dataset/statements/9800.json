Rick Perry convened the grand jury that <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/documents/2014/aug/15/read-indictment-against-gov-rick-perry/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>indicted him</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&#39;t judge Palin&rsquo;s corruption opinion. But the former Alaska governor&#39;s claim about the DA&rsquo;s connection to the grand jury is incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palin, in a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/17/gov-perry-indicted-everything-big-in-texas-even-this-bs/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>commentary</u></a> posted on the Fox News website Aug. 17, 2014, said: &quot;This ridiculous politically motivated &lsquo;indictment&rsquo; of&quot; Perry &quot;stems from the ugly thug tactics of the &lsquo;politics of personal destruction&rsquo; that the left is known for.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First and foremost,&quot; Palin said, &quot;today&#39;s liberals have no shame. Case in point: Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg.&quot; Palin recapped Lehmberg&rsquo;s drunken driving conviction from 2013 and noted that Lehmberg refused to resign afterward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lehmberg&#39;s D.A.&rsquo;s office runs the state&rsquo;s Public Integrity Unit, which prosecutes public crimes like government corruption,&quot; Palin wrote, and after Perry tried to get her to resign or face his veto of the unit&rsquo;s state funding, Palin said, Democrat Lehmberg&rsquo;s &quot;liberal supporters filed an ethics complaint against Perry...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, Palin wrote, the &quot;Travis County D.A.&#39;s Office, still under Lehmberg, convened a grand jury, and &ndash; surprise, surprise! &ndash; Perry was &lsquo;indicted.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a fact that a liberal-leaning group, Texans for Public Justice, which monitors the influence of money in state politics and the courts, submitted a <a href=\"http://info.tpj.org/press_releases/pdf/Threatcomplaint.coxescamilla.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>complaint</u></a> to the Travis County district attorney&rsquo;s office on June 14, 2013 about Perry&rsquo;s actions. The complaint was submitted a day after the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/officials-perry-vows-veto-of-state-funding-unless-/nYHRm/#81d199a8.257409.735466\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>revealed</u></a> Perry was threatening to veto a $7.5 million, two-year appropriation to the Public Integrity Unit, housed in the district attorney&rsquo;s office, unless Lehmberg resigned. Texans for Public Justice&rsquo;s complaint alleged that the threat amounted to a violation of state laws prohibiting coercion of public officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day the complaint came in, Gregg Cox, the attorney who heads the Public Integrity Unit, <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/complaint-perry-veto-threat-violates-state-law/nYLQK/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>told the </u><u>Statesman</u></a> that Lehmberg&rsquo;s office would not investigate it. &quot;It&rsquo;s clear, it would not be appropriate for us to have any role in this,&quot; Cox said then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upshot: Lehmberg subsequently recused herself from the matter, which ended up being overseen by a Republican judge from Bexar County and a San Antonio-based special prosecutor appointed by the judge, neither one picked by Lehmberg or her office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In checking Palin&rsquo;s claim, we reached out to relevant judges and Lehmberg&rsquo;s office, finding no sign the DA&rsquo;s office played a role in convening or guiding the grand jury that indicted Perry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By telephone, <a href=\"http://www.electjudgerichardson.com/experience.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bert Richardson</u></a> of San Antonio, the senior state district judge overseeing the Perry case, and Republican <a href=\"http://www.wilco.org/CountyDepartments/DistrictCourts/26thDistrictCourt/tabid/479/language/en-US/Default.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Billy Ray Stubblefield</u></a>, the Williamson County state district judge who appointed Richardson to oversee the review, declined to comment on Palin&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But an Austin-based judge who momentarily managed the complaint and the Travis County assistant district attorney who works with most grand juries each said Lehmberg&rsquo;s office had no role in convening the grand jury that indicted Perry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.co.travis.tx.us/courts/criminal/district/390.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Julie Kocurek</u></a>, who presides over the 390th criminal district court in Travis County, called Palin&rsquo;s statement &quot;completely and absolutely false.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kocurek said that after Lehmberg&rsquo;s office received the complaint about Perry, lawyers from the office brought it to Kocurek &nbsp;in her capacity as presiding judge for the county&rsquo;s criminal district courts. The DA&rsquo;s office also brought a motion to recuse its attorneys from acting on the complaint because, Kocurek said, Lehmberg was obviously entangled. Similarly, Kocurek said, she recused herself as a judge in the matter given that she had worked for the DA&rsquo;s office in the past and continued to routinely work with Lehmberg on matters of criminal justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accord with state law, Kocurek said, her next step was to turn the matter over to Stubblefield, &nbsp;the presiding judge of the 3rd Judicial District that includes Travis County. Kocurek said Stubblefield then appointed Richardson, &quot;a very non-partisan straight-shooter judge,&quot; to handle proceedings involving the complaint. Richardson&rsquo;s job, she said, was to appoint an attorney to serve as the district attorney in the matter; that appointee, Michael McCrum of San Antonio, subsequently worked with the Travis County special grand jury named in April 2014 that ultimately indicted Perry. McCrum didn&rsquo;t respond to our telephone inquiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richardson, Kocurek said, sat in her courtroom to impanel the grand jury, which consisted of a dozen residents and two alternates drawn from a pool of 80 county residents created at random. &quot;They didn&rsquo;t know what case they&rsquo;d be hearing,&quot; Kocurek said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also drew a recap of the Perry matter from Lehmberg&rsquo;s office. Gary Cobb, director of the office&rsquo;s grand jury division, said by phone that when the TPJ complaint was received, the office recognized it couldn&rsquo;t reasonably handle the topic. &quot;Because of a clear conflict of interest, we didn&rsquo;t do anything but receive the complaint and recuse ourselves, putting in motion the process of having a special prosecutor assigned to it,&quot; Cobb said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office-wide recusal, Cobb said, was sought so that &quot;later on we wouldn&rsquo;t be accused of having some kind of undue influence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked if Lehmberg&rsquo;s office played some role in choosing who would serve on the special grand jury that indicted Perry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cobb said not, adding that Richardson or Kocurek would have notified the district clerk&rsquo;s office that a pool of potential jurors, chosen randomly from adult residents of the county with a Texas driver&rsquo;s license or state-issued identification card, was needed on the date (April 14, 2014) Richardson wanted to impanel the grand jury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DA&rsquo;s office &quot;had no role&quot; in the grand jury&rsquo;s impaneling, Cobb said. &quot;We don&rsquo;t even show up.&quot; Generally, Cobb said, the office has no role in determining which residents are in the larger pool of potential jurors; that duty, he said, resides with the county&rsquo;s district clerk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the special grand jury&rsquo;s initial three-month term ended, Cobb said, its term was extended another three months. &quot;They have a right and can request an extension for an additional three months in order to complete business,&quot; Cobb said. &quot;They did make the request and they did extend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, Cobb said, &quot;we went out of our way to make sure we didn&rsquo;t do anything that even gave the appearance of having any kind of involvement in the investigation for this case against Rick Perry,&quot; though occasionally the office had to coordinate schedules so different grand juries weren&rsquo;t simultaneously trying to occupy the room the county sets aside for grand juries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palin said that under Lehmberg, the &quot;Travis County D.A.&rsquo;s office&quot; convened the grand jury that indicted Perry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A special grand jury consisting of Travis County citizens indicted Perry in August 2014. But Lehmberg&rsquo;s office played no role in organizing the jurors. Early on, Lehmberg&rsquo;s office recused itself from handling the complaint that eventually resulted in the grand jury whose secret deliberations culminated in Perry&rsquo;s felony charges. A senior district judge from San Antonio, chosen by a judge based in Williamson County, impaneled the grand jury. The San Antonio judge picked a San Antonio lawyer to prosecute the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>FALSE</strong> </em><em>&ndash; The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-20T19:47:02.190994", "ruling_date": "2014-08-21T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sarah Palin incorrect Rosemary Lehmberg's office convened grand jury that indicted Rick Perry", "ruling_headline_slug": "palin-incorrect-rosemary-lehmberg-convened-grand-j", "ruling_link_text": "Lehmberg recused her office", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Commentary by Sarah Palin, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/17/gov-perry-indicted-everything-big-in-texas-even-this-bs/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Gov.
