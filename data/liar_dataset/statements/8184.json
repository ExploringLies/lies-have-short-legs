This is what he&rsquo;s done to Newark,&quot; Lonegan said. &quot;So he&rsquo;s done using Newark as a stepping stone. Now he wants to go to Washington, D.C. and do exactly the same thing to the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Lonegan is correct that Newark has seen an increase in overall violent crime over the course of Booker&rsquo;s tenure, his statement is inaccurate and misleading, according to crime statistics compiled through the FBI&rsquo;s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lonegan is wrong to say violent crime and murders have increased &quot;five years in a row,&quot; since there were decreases in some of those years. In addition, the numbers in three of the four violent crime categories in 2012 were below their levels from 2007, Booker&rsquo;s first full year in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lonegan spokesman Will Gattenby said the candidate was trying to make the point that violent crime in Newark has increased significantly since 2007. Booker took office in July 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The number of violent crimes per year has increased during Cory Booker&rsquo;s tenure,&quot; Gattenby said in an e-mail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UCR program also includes data on overall property crime -- which has dropped since the start of Booker&rsquo;s tenure -- but this fact-check is focused on violent crime, since that was the subject of Lonegan&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the UCR program, violent crime is defined to include murders, forcible rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Over the past five years, each category has seen a mix of yearly decreases and increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To analyze Lonegan&rsquo;s statement, PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed UCR statistics for Newark for 2007 through 2012. The 2012 figures, reported by the Newark Police Department, are preliminary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Lonegan said there have been increases for &quot;five years in a row,&quot; overall violent crime only increased annually in three of the five years between 2008 and 2012. Murders increased in four of the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall violent crime dropped in 2009 and 2012, compared to the preceding years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murders have increased every year since 2009, but in 2008, there was a nearly 36 percent drop to 67 murders from 104 in 2007. In recent years, the number of murders has increased minimally, going from 90 in 2010 to 95 in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 2007 and 2012, overall violent crime in Newark increased from 2,415 offenses in 2007 to 3,219 last year, marking an increase of about 33 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that increase was driven by only one of the four violent crime categories. In 2012, the only category higher than its respective 2007 figure was robberies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 1,976 robberies last year, marking a nearly 79 percent increase over the 1,104 in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By comparison, the 95 murders in 2012 were almost 9 percent less than the 104 murders in 2007. In fact, since 2008, the number of yearly murders in Newark has never exceeded the 2007 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, the numbers of forcible rapes and aggravated assaults were down from their 2007 levels by about 8 percent and roughly 4.7 percent, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement, Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Booker campaign, said in part: &quot;Mr. Lonegan is again using statistics misleadingly. Crime is down in Newark since Cory Booker took office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a radio interview, Lonegan claimed that under Booker, Newark has seen &quot;violent crime up five years in a row, murder up five years in a row.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That statement is accurate in the sense that overall violent crime has increased over the past five years. But violent crime and murders have not gone up &quot;five years in a row,&quot; since there were decreases in some years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the increase in overall violent crime between 2007 and 2012 stems solely from a rise in robberies. The other violent crime categories in 2012, including murders, were below their 2007 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/politifact_nj_cory_booker_has_overseen_rise_in_violent_crime_murders_steve_lonegan_claims.html#incart_river_default\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This story has been updated to clarify that overall violent crime has not increased in every year of Booker&#39;s tenure.
