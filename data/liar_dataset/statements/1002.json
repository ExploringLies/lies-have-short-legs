LaPierre said Sunstein is \"a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n LaPierre isn't alone in making similar claims. Go to the self-explanatory Web site StopSunstein.com, sponsored by the American Conservative Union, and you'll find this quote from one of Sunstein's books: \"Animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives &hellip;\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The quote comes from Sunstein's 2004 book\n <em>\n  Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions\n </em>\n . We call your attention to Chapter 11, titled \"Can Animals Sue?\" Sunstein argues that there are already plenty of animal cruelty laws on the books that just aren't enforced.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n In a speech at Harvard in 2007, Sunstein argued there is \"a real gap\" in the laws governing animal cruelty laws, essentially that prosecutors have a monopoly in making sure those laws are followed. \"The law should be changed to give affected persons, interested persons, those who have some sort of connection with the animal, a right to sue either for damages or for an injunction to get that violation of what is standard already in law to stop.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n That Sunstein is an animal rights activist is undisputed. For a CNN interview in the late 1990s, he once insisted on being joined on-air by his dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Perry. And LaPierre is correct when he says that Sunstein has talked about allowing animals to sue &mdash; albeit through a human representative. But we think LaPierre has twisted Sunstein's words. Sunstein wasn't saying you &mdash; the meat eater &mdash; could be sued by Porky Pig for eating bacon. But he was saying that if the pig that winds up on your breakfast plate was raised or killed in a way that violates existing animal cruelty laws, then someone ought to be able to sue the processor on the pig's behalf. That's all, folks.\n</p>\n<p>\n We rate LaPierre's statement Half True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:46.159994", "ruling_date": "2009-05-05T15:28:04", "ruling_headline": "Sunstein has said people ought to be able to sue on behalf of abused animals", "ruling_headline_slug": "sunstein-has-said-people-ought-be-able-sue-behalf-", "ruling_link_text": "Bessie the Cow vs. Meat Eaters", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n WorldNetDaily,\n <a href=\"http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=96301\" target=\"_blank\">\n  \"U.S. regulatory czar nominee wants Net 'Fairness Doctrine'\"\n </a>\n April 27, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n StopSunstein.com,\n <a href=\"http://stopsunstein.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  \"Stop the Sunstein Confirmation!\"\n </a>\n sponsored by the American Conservative Union\n</p>\n<p>\n Office of Management and Budget Web site,\n <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/regulatory_affairs/default/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Information &amp; Regulatory Affairs\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n UStream,\n <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/1193317\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Video: Wayne LaPierre at CPAC\n </a>\n , Jan. 27, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Google Video,\n <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2586700172704318361&amp;ei=80H_Sc_9CJv6rALb-5XtAw&amp;q=cass+sunstein&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Facing Animals, Sunstein speaks at Harvard University\n </a>\n (Sunstein begins about the 40 minute mark), 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n <em>\n  Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions\n </em>\n , by Cass Sunstein, 2004\n <em>\n  <br />\n </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n The Wall Street Journal,\n <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123138051682263203.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  \"Obama's Regulatory Czar Likely to Set a New Tone\"\n </a>\n by Jonathan Weisman and jess Bravin, Jan. 7, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Chicago Tribune,\n <a href=\"http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jan/23/business/chi-fri-burns-sunsteinjan23\" target=\"_blank\">\n  \"Cass Sunstein, President Barack Obama&rsquo;s pick for regulatory czar, has liberals nervous\"\n </a>\n by Greg Burns, Jan. 23, 2009\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Wayne", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "", "id": 159, "last_name": "LaPierre", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "wayne-lapierre", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/LaPierre.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/159/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Cass Sunstein, President Obama's nominee for regulatory czar, \"wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "statement_context": "a CPAC conference", "statement_date": "2009-02-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
