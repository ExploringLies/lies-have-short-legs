Scott had promised to cut taxes by $1 billion over two years, but lawmakers are <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/gov--scotts-jobs-tax-cut-plans-may-face-uphill-climb-in-capitol/2249646\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>already signaling that may not be possible</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a reporter asked Scott how he can push tax cuts and still guarantee public schools the capital funding they need, Scott repeated a boast he&rsquo;s made before: &quot;We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott and Florida Republicans have been making the claim since his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/oct/06/republican-party-florida/rick-scott-holds-record-education-funding-republic/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2014 re-election campaign</u></a> that school funding has been at historic levels, but it&rsquo;s simply not a complete picture of the education budget. (Scott intends to release his full budget proposal in December.) We decided it was time to revisit this particular claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Total vs. per-pupil vs. inflation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The education budget has been a prickly issue for Scott since he recommended major cuts in his first year in office. State tax revenues have recovered with the end of the recession, and Scott has pushed to move the budget back up each year since, which has led to his current claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist squabbled <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/jul/18/charlie-crist/rick-scotts-student-spending-about-200-less-during/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign</u></a> over who held the spending record, we noted they <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/scott-calls-proposed-pupil-spending-historic/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>both could stake a claim</u></a>: Scott had the largest budget in total dollars, while Crist spent the most per student back in 2007-08.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Scott well into his second term, the same is still true today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After winning re-election, Scott wanted to bump up spending in his <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/gov-rick-scott-unveils-plan-to-boost-floridas-per-student-spending/2213329\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>January 2015 budget proposal</u></a>, to $19.75 billion total and $7,176 per pupil. That would have been about $850,000 higher than the previous year&rsquo;s budget, and $50 higher per student than the record of $7,126 under Crist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Legislature has the final say, and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2015/may/28/revisiting-legislatures-budget-showdown/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>faced a budget deadlock over several issues</u></a>, including a debate about potentially expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida used about $900 million each in federal stimulus money for the budget, for example. Also, the amount of property taxes collected through what is known as the <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/5423/urlt/Fefpdist.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Required Local Effort</u></a> can change from year to year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott&#39;s office said&nbsp;the budget is at its highest level ever in terms of total dollars. But&nbsp;you would expect it to be, considering the K-12 school system also has its highest enrollment ever. There are about 100,000 more students today than when Scott took office, and about 140,000 more than when Crist oversaw the highest per-pupil spending in 2007-08.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The money in today&rsquo;s budget isn&rsquo;t exceeding the record level in terms of sheer dollars per student, but that&rsquo;s even less so when we factor for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator</u></a>, which is somewhat imprecise but can give us broad insight on the subject, even Scott&rsquo;s January 2015 request to best Crist&rsquo;s spending by $50 per student lags far behind. Just to match 2007&rsquo;s $7,126, per-pupil spending would have to be in the neighborhood of $8,190 today. Using this method, the current total budget would have to be in excess of $21.4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve rated claims <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/jan/29/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-k-12-education-budget-proposal/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>similar to this one</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/scott-calls-proposed-pupil-spending-historic/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True in the past</u></a>, but it&rsquo;s apparent that Scott&rsquo;s claim is misleading. Any reasonable person would expect a growing education system to naturally have a larger budget after nearly a decade. In this case, the dollars simply don&rsquo;t go as far as they once did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott said, &quot;We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s accurate in one sense, because the state&rsquo;s total education budget is at an all-time high of $19.7 billion. But enrollment is also higher than in years past. Per-pupil spending is still below historic dollar totals and remains far below equitable levels when adjusted for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Education spending has essentially stood still over the last nine years. Scott&rsquo;s claim obscures that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts.
