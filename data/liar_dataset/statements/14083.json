Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The quote gets good play in leadership circles and memes online.

The real person who said the quote, or at least a version of it, could be a woman known for celebrating her fake attributes, Dolly Parton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve never seen that from J. Q. Adams,&quot; said H. W. Brands, a University of Texas at Austin presidential historian and author. &quot;It doesn&#39;t sound like him. He wasn&#39;t the dreamy type.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brands continued:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Adams had a rather crimped view of human nature. He thought most people were rascals. He disliked democracy because he thought it fostered pandering to people&#39;s baser instincts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\"><em>Collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Adams was a prolific writer, in keeping with family tradition. He maintained a diary from 1779 to 1847, spanning more than 15,000 manuscript pages and 51 volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, we did not read them all, nor did we review his complete correspondence and speeches from his time in the revolution and as a lawyer, diplomat, secretary of state, and president from 1825-1829.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we did talk with someone else well-versed in his considerable output: Sara Martin, editor in chief of The Adams Papers of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am confident that this is not a JQA quotation,&quot; she said. &quot;It neither sounds like him, nor is it really the vein of political thought that he typically expresses in his quotations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She sent us real quotes from Adams relating to leadership to show the difference, backed up with links to his diary entries.

The website concluded that the quote likely evolved from a version used by Parton before it was assigned to Adams in its current form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quote Investigator found that the 1997 book <em>The Most Important Thing I Know&nbsp;</em>quotes the singer and actor as offering, &quot;If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quotation Ivanka Trump chose, one of many, is a worthy reflection. But it was a silly and easily avoided mistake to assign the words to John Quincy Adams, as others on the internet have done, when there is no record of him saying it. There are a lot of other verified options.
