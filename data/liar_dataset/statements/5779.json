The scholarship, which helps pay for in-state college tuition, began providing less money to all but the highest-performing students in August.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdams thinks HOPE needs a long-term fix, but it&rsquo;s still generous, he said in an April 15 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHOPE is &quot;still the richest scholarship program in America,&quot; Adams said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill? Despite all of the changes?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHOPE now pays full tuition for only about 10 &nbsp;percent of recipients. The rest receive scholarships that cover 90 percent of tuition at 2010-11 academic year rates. That percentage will shrink over time. Tuition rose this school year and will climb again in August.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA University of Georgia spokeswoman said that Adams based his statement on data from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, which PolitiFact used to assess a March 2011 statement by Gov. Nathan Deal:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college,&quot; Deal said then. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rated his claim True. Georgia was near or at the top, depending on what measure you considered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the past four decades, NASSGAP has kept track of how much money each state awards in postsecondary education scholarships and grants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Deal made his statement, the most recent data available covered the 2008-09 school year. Back then, Georgia awarded nearly $567 million in total grant aid. We ranked fourth in the nation behind California, New York and Florida, according to the association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDivide that total by the number of students enrolled in undergraduate programs, and Georgia was second only to South Carolina.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia&rsquo;s HOPE program was also the largest of its kind. NASSGAP classifies HOPE as a &quot;non-needs-based&quot; scholarship, which means it awards money on factors aside from a student&rsquo;s financial need.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia awarded some $565 million in non-needs-based money, NASSGAP reported. This amount included funds for other non-needs-based scholarships, but HOPE spending accounted for a vast majority of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida, which ranked second, gave out about $100 million less.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that was three years ago. Is HOPE &quot;still&quot; the richest scholarship in America, as Adams said? &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s tough to say with certainty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNASSGAP numbers have been updated, but its latest data dates from about two years ago. It does not reflect the HOPE cuts passed in the spring session of 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, this data does hint at how HOPE currently compares to other programs. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia awarded about $672 million in non-needs-based scholarships such as HOPE during the 2009-2010 academic year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce again, Florida came in second. But the gap between it and Georgia grew to nearly $250 million. Tennessee, South Carolina and Louisiana round out the top five with amounts between $135 million and $262 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia came in second on a per-capita basis as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther states give away larger pots of money, but not many of them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNationally, about three-quarters of state grants are awarded based on financial need, said Frank Ballmann, a NASSGAP official.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalifornia gave away more than $1 billion in needs-based financial aid in the 2009-2010 school year. New York placed second at about $900 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Georgia&rsquo;s program dwarfed almost all other state efforts that year. Pennsylvania, which was third place in needs-based aid, gave away about $413 million in needs-based aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s take a look at HOPE awards after the cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotals for 2011-2012 are not yet available. The Georgia Student Finance Commission, which administers HOPE and other state scholarship and aid programs, is still giving out money, a commission official said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut projected amounts are available. After HOPE was cut, the Finance Commission&rsquo;s budget was trimmed to reflect the changes. This updated budget allocates some $590 million for the HOPE grant, GED and scholarship programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt this funding level, Georgia&rsquo;s ranking may fall this school year. NASSGAP&rsquo;s data shows that over the past 10 years, states have doubled the amount of money they give out, not cut it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the numbers also suggest that HOPE will remain one of the nation&rsquo;s most generous programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis $590 million budget would have qualified HOPE for a slot somewhere in NASSGAP&rsquo;s top five two years ago, all other things being equal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor Georgia to drop out of the top 10 this year, total grant aid awarded by lower-ranked states would have to grow by hundreds of millions of dollars. That&rsquo;s unlikely in these austere times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdams&rsquo; assertion that HOPE is &quot;still the richest scholarship program in America&quot; needs some context. Georgia&rsquo;s program was the richest of its kind two school years ago, and it ranked high in other measures, although this state&rsquo;s pot of money wasn&rsquo;t the biggest overall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHOPE is likely to remain near the top this school year. Even with the cuts, other states are probably too far behind to catch up, for now. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdams earns a Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-20T14:51:28.506758", "ruling_date": "2012-04-23T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "PolitiFact: Calling HOPE 'richest' program goes too far", "ruling_headline_slug": "politifact-calling-hope-richest-program-goes-too-f", "ruling_link_text": "It's the richest of its kind", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/subscribers/tuition-increases-likely-to-1416113.html\">Tuition increases likely to fuel HOPE debate</a>,&quot; April 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-government/hope-dwindles-for-future-1403421.html\">HOPE dwindles for future class</a>,&quot; April 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/with-hope-cuts-coming-962608.html\">With HOPE cuts coming, students turn to summer school</a>,&quot; May 31, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/mar/15/nathan-deal/deal-says-hope-revamp-still-good-students/\">Deal says HOPE overhaul still good for students</a>,&quot; March 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, <a href=\"http://www.nassgap.org/viewrepository.aspx?categoryID=3\">Repository - Annual Surveys</a>, accessed April 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Student Finance Commission, <a href=\"http://www.gsfc.org/gsfcnew/SandG_facts.CFM\">Scholarship &amp; Grant Award History</a>, accessed April 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia House of Representatives, Budget and Research Office, <a href=\"http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/house/budget/budgetDocs.htm\">amended fiscal year 2012 budget</a>, accessed April 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Cynthia Hoke, director, Public Affairs News Service, University of Georgia, April 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Frank Ballmann, director, Federal Relations, National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, April 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Tracy Ireland, vice president, Georgia Student Finance Commission, April 18, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "President of the University of Georgia", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 1823, "last_name": "Adams", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-adams", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Adams.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1823/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tGeorgia&rsquo;s HOPE scholarship is &quot;still the richest scholarship program in America.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a newspaper article", "statement_date": "2012-04-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
