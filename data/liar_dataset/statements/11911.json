Marco Rubio, called on President Barack Obama to hold back on his replacement and leave the decision to the next president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not believe the president should appoint someone,&quot; said Rubio, a Florida senator. &quot;And it&#39;s not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see what history shows about lame-duck presidential picks to the Supreme Court. We emailed spokespersons for Rubio and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nominations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically presidents don&rsquo;t &quot;appoint&quot; a justice to the Supreme Court. They nominate someone who is then confirmed by the U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also the problem of whether Obama should be considered a lame duck or not. Some would say Obama isn&rsquo;t a lame duck until after Election Day in November when his successor is chosen. Others might say all second-term presidents are lame ducks because they know they won&rsquo;t serve again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The definition has evolved,&quot; said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Decades ago, the lame-duck label was applied to a president after an election, but the term has changed over time to include any officeholder in his or her last term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, election-year Supreme Court nominations are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dies-at-79/election-year-nominations-are-rare\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>rare</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s statement prompted several comments on Twitter from those who noted a specific exception to his claim: the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate confirmed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/04/us/senate-97-to-0-confirms-kennedy-to-high-court.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kennedy </u></a>97-0 on Feb. 4, 1988. That was about 28&nbsp;years ago -- not 80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis Powell, who retired, and was Reagan&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/12/us/reagan-nominates-anthony-kennedy-to-supreme-court.html?pagewanted=all\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>third nomination</u></a> for the opening, after Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg. Powell announced his retirement in June 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reagan, who was in his second term, nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Kennedy was confirmed in February 1988. In November 1988, Reagan&rsquo;s vice president George H.W. Bush won the presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The nomination actually wasn&#39;t in the election year, although the confirmation vote was,&quot; said Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This came up minutes later in the debate, when U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, &quot;We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.&quot; Debate moderator <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/13/the-cbs-republican-debate-transcript-annotated/#annotations:8671633\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>John Dickerson</u></a> of CBS News corrected Cruz by noting that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not certain which nomination Rubio was referring to 80 years ago. One possibility is when President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Nathan Cardozo to fill a vacancy in February 1932, and Cardozo was confirmed that same month. Hoover then went on to lose re-election later that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But Hoover was not a lame duck; he was eligible for re-election even though he lost,&quot; said Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 2010, the Senate has rejected 16 of 34 Supreme Court nominations because of opposition to the nominating president, according to a 2010 <a href=\"http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31171.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Congressional Research Service</u></a> report. Seven of the rejected nominations were put forward by presidents in their final year in office <em>after </em>a new president had been elected but <em>before </em>the successor took over. But those were more than 80 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Each of these &lsquo;lame duck&rsquo; nominations transpired under 19th century presidents when the post-election period lasted from early November until early March,&quot; the report states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said, &quot;It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent contradiction of this claim would be Reagan&rsquo;s nomination of Kennedy. Kennedy was nominated in November 1987 and confirmed during Reagan&rsquo;s final year of office in February 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reagan&rsquo;s timeline doesn&rsquo;t exactly line up with what Obama faces; Reagan had more time between his nomination and the end of his presidency. But it&rsquo;s hard for us to see how Obama can be considered a lame duck but not Reagan. Both were second-term presidents who knew they would not serve again but did not yet know who their successor would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/68b4dac8-5559-4038-8f50-583a60a214a4\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/68b4dac8-5559-4038-8f50-583a60a214a4</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-14T00:23:01.391090", "ruling_date": "2016-02-14T00:27:30", "ruling_headline": "Rubio exaggerates in saying it's been 80 years since a 'lame duck' made a Supreme Court nomination", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-exaggerates-sayig-its-been-80-years-lame-duc", "ruling_link_text": "If Reagan wasn't a lame duck, how is Obama?
