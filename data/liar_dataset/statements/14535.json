But he emphasized the larger point, saying the difference between the numbers that he might have mixed up is small.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Russell didn&rsquo;t give any additional evidence, but the statement announcing the advisory cited data from the attorney general&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2000, concerns from both Missouri residents and the legislature prompted the passage of a law that requires law enforcement officers collect specific information, including race, for every traffic stop. Each agency must provide this data to the attorney general, who in turn sends it to the governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A team of researchers has been compiling this information for the attorney general since 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ago.mo.gov/home/vehicle-stops-report/2016-executive-summary\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Vehicle Stops Report Executive Summary</a>&nbsp;from the attorney general&rsquo;s office breaks down the data related to vehicle stops last year. There were 21 agencies that did not submit the data by the required date and 58 agencies that reported no stops out of 682 law enforcement agencies in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blacks represent 10.9 percent of the driving population and 18 percent of all traffic stops, while whites represent 82.8 percent of the population and 78 percent of stops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has been on the research team since 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosenfeld said the researchers divided stops made by the number of people 16 years and older in the state to come up with a &quot;stop rate.&quot; A value of one means there is no disparity, values greater than one mean there is overrepresentation, and values below one mean there is underrepresentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disparity index, which is the proportion of stops divided by the proportion of the population, was 1.65 for blacks last year, overrepresenting the black population by 65 percent. Whites, on the other hand, were stopped at a .94 rate, underrepresenting the white population by 6 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers divided 1.65 by .94 to get 1.75, or a 75 percent higher stop rate for blacks than whites. This is the number Johnson used in his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But stops and searches are different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. (Formula: 8.77 percent search rate for blacks divided by 5.57 search rate for whites = 1.57.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson stated that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blacks in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officers than whites, which is reflected in the attorney general data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not true about searches. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. The discrepancy in searches is huge, but it&rsquo;s not 75 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Johnson&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-18T09:48:35.808428", "ruling_date": "2017-09-18T09:59:41", "ruling_headline": "NAACP president is partially accurate on stops and searches statistic", "ruling_headline_slug": "naacp-president-partially-accurate-stops-and-searc", "ruling_link_text": "Right about stops, off-base on searches", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NAACP statement, &quot;NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri&quot;, NAACP&rsquo;s website, August 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.senate.mo.gov/17info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=57095378\" target=\"_blank\">Senate bill, &quot;SB 43&quot;,</a>&nbsp;Missouri Senate website, June 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NYT article,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/travel/naacp-missouri-travel-advisory.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;N.A.A.C.P. to Missouri: You&rsquo;re No Safe Space (Still)</a>,&quot; New York Times, Aug. 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government report, &quot;<a href=\"http://ago.mo.gov/home/vehicle-stops-report/2016-executive-summary\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Vehicle Stops Executive Summary</a>,&quot; Missouri Attorney General&rsquo;s website, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Kansas City Star</em> article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article159183319.html\" target=\"_blank\">Greitens signs bill that raises standards for fired employees to win discrimination cases</a>,&quot; The <em>Kansas City Star</em>, June 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Kansas City Star</em> article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article164851802.html\" target=\"_blank\">NAACP issues a first-ever travel advisory for a state &mdash; and it&rsquo;s Missouri</a>,&quot; The <em>Kansas City Star</em>, Aug. 1, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview, Richard Rosenfeld, Sept. 1, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone call, NAACP Media Contact Malik Russell, Sept. 5, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-s-policies-detrimental-to-african-americans-health-national-naacp/article_7f8af7f4-b9aa-59fe-a759-ace55d9b1ed4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Missouri&rsquo;s policies &lsquo;detrimental&rsquo; to African Americans&rsquo; health, national NAACP leader says</a>,&quot; St. Louis Post Dispatch, Aug. 29, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Interim president and CEO", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Derrick ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Maryland", "id": 4043, "last_name": "Johnson", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "derrick-johnson", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NAACP_interim_head.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4043/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.naacp.org/naacp-leadership/derrick-johnson/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a travel advisory", "statement_date": "2017-08-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 130, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/130/", "subject": "Diversity", "subject_slug": "diversity", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "NAACP president is partially accurate on stops and searches statistic"}
