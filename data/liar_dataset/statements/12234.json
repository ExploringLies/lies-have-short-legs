Activists have been arguing for years that plastic bags harm the environment, but now there&#39;s also concern that &nbsp;plastic products may be a detriment to the planet because they break down so slowly -- or not at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s the point made by actor Jeff Bridges in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JeffBridgesOfficial/videos/1004864046268755/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a March 28 Facebook video</u></a> that he narrates on behalf of the <a href=\"http://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Plastic Pollution Coalition</u></a>. When last we checked, it had over 453,000 shares. A statement at the beginning caught our attention:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Plastic is a substance the Earth cannot digest, and every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists,&quot; he says. &quot;Plastic never goes away.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every bit still exists? Never goes away?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered how quickly that claim would degrade under scrutiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike some types of plastic, it fell apart pretty quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, some types of plastic are very slow to decompose, and under some conditions plastics can persist for decades or centuries. Bridges has a point that these types are pollutants and major causes for concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But all the researchers we talked to said plastics have gone away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric Grulke, associate dean for research in the college of engineering at the University of Kentucky, said a lot of plastic products are no longer around because they&#39;ve been burned. Incinerators consume them, sometimes to generate electricity, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s most often done in Europe and Japan, where about 12 percent of solid waste is plastic, said Anthony Andrady, a chemical and biomolecular engineer at North Carolina State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other plastic decomposes at varying rates, depending on the type of plastic and where it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polyethylene, &quot;which is your basic hefty bag material, breaks down really, really slowly, and in a landfill it might not break down at all because it&#39;s typically starved of oxygen and water. So a polyethylene bag made in 1960 might still be with us, particularly if it&#39;s in a landfill,&quot; said Eric Beckman, a chemical and petroleum engineer at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On the other hand, if &nbsp;you&#39;re talking about polylactic acid, which is popular in disposable tableware these days, that&#39;s actually designed to degrade,&quot; he said. &quot;And if it&#39;s in a composting environment, it will go away in a matter of weeks to months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If it&#39;s sitting out in the environment, within a year it would be dust,&quot; said Grulke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheets of polylactic acid that line rows of crops on a farm, allowing the plants to poke through but deterring the growth of weeds, are made to decompose in sunlight. The same ultraviolet light that damages our skin &quot;chops up organic molecules fairly efficient,&quot; said Beckman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a lot of microscopic bugs have a talent for breaking apart the strong bonds that make many plastics so durable. But they exist, said Rigoberto Advincula, chairman of the polymer chemistry division of the American Chemical Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And not all decomposition is good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ocean, there&#39;s two types of degradation, said Beckman. &quot;The good type is when it&#39;s actually chemically falling apart. When you have water and sunlight, that helps things go faster. There&#39;s also mechanical degradation, where you have a bottle that slowly gets ground down by bumping into other things and becomes chips. That&#39;s bad because fish will eat that. You can find fish with bits of plastic in their stomach.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrady said it&#39;s not universally desirable to have plastics break down or be burned because it takes a lot of energy to make them, energy that could be saved if they were recycled. To throw away a styrofoam cup or plastic cutlery &quot;is a waste,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And someday, if we run out of the oil that serves as the raw material for making resilient plastics and there are landfills with high concentrations of plastic waste, &quot;I can imagine people mining the landfills to get that resource. That is not inconceivable at all.&quot; Andrady said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Bridges&#39; press spokeswoman, called the Plastic Pollution Coalition (their voicemail wasn&#39;t accepting messages) and emailed the group two different ways. None of our inquires produced a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bridges&#39; statement was absolute: &quot;Every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experts say that&#39;s rubbish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s too all-encompassing,&quot; said Beckman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although far too much plastic persists in the environment in places and in forms that are unwanted, too much has been burned or degraded to make the assertion accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because his provocative claim leaves no room for subtlety, we rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f027af23-dc79-499a-9868-6a2140f87505\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f027af23-dc79-499a-9868-6a2140f87505</a>\r\n\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-13T17:37:48.762074", "ruling_date": "2016-04-14T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rubbish!
