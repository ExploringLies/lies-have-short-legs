David Rivera, who has criticized President Barack Obama&#39;s loosening of restrictions in policy toward Cuba, blasted the president following a White House reception for new members of Congress in January.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRivera&#39;s guest at the reception, former political prisoner Cary Roque, delivered a letter to Obama dated Aug. 25, 2010, that was signed by 26 Cuban exile organizations. The letter asked for a meeting with the president or a member of his administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next day, the Miami Republican accused Obama of not doing enough to accommodate Cuban exiles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In the past,&quot; Rivera said in a statement on Jan. 25, 2011, &quot;President Obama has refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations, so I was proud to take Cary Roque as my guest to the White House last night to help the president put a real human face to the issue of Cuba. I thought it was important to introduce him to someone who knows first-hand what it&rsquo;s like to be imprisoned and abused by the Castro dictatorship.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore he was elected in November 2008, Obama stressed the need for a new policy approach to Cuba. He also called for the lifting of limits on Cuban Americans who want to visit Cuba or send money to relatives on the island.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut had he &quot;refused&quot; to meet with reps from Cuban exile groups, as Rivera alleged?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRivera defined &quot;exile organizations&quot; as the ones that signed Roque&#39;s letter, according to his spokeswoman Leslie Veiga. These groups include Consejo por la Libertad de Cuba, Frente Nacional Presidio Politico, Presidio Politico Historico y Casa del Preso and Junta Militar de Veteranos Cubanos.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut others interpret &quot;exile organizations&quot; more broadly to include other groups and individuals, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I laughed when I read the quote,&quot; said Jeff Garcia, a partner at Balsera Communications, a Miami firm that boasts it delivered much of the Hispanic vote to secure an Obama victory. &quot;What David was saying (was that Obama) refuses to meet with <em>his </em>people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that Obama has met with various Cuban exile leaders, including Carlos Rodriguez, co-chair of the Cuba Study Group, before he took office&nbsp;January 2009. But maybe Rivera meant meetings with representatives -- or leaders -- from the Cuban exile groups after his January 2009 inauguration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found one meeting Obama had,&nbsp;on April 15, 2010,&nbsp;with a pair of prominent exiles: Gloria and Emilio Estefan.&nbsp;He met with the celebrity couple at their home on exclusive Star Island as part of a fundraiser for the Democratic Party that raised $2.5 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven though the Estefans aren&#39;t Democrats, they say they wanted to get the president&#39;s ear on Cuba&rsquo;s human rights record. Gloria Estefan gave Obama letters from dissidents, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/04/15/1582146/in-florida-obama-finds-give-and.html\">according to the <em>Miami Herald</em></a>. (Some Cuban-American exiles assailed the fundraising event because they believe Obama is not tough enough on Cuba.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe couple has a long history in defense of human rights. In October, the Cuban Liberty Council honored the Estefans as &quot;Heroes of Liberty&quot; in downtown Miami. A month before, the couple led a march of tens of thousands in Little Havana for Cuba&#39;s Las Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, Obama met in October 2010 with Joe Garcia, the former head of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, who helped the administration formulate its travel policy. Garcia, who lost to Rivera in the recent congressional race, and Obama had their heart-to-heart at El Mago De Las Fritas on Calle Ocho.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We talked about Cuba, how to facilitate civil society, how to adjust travel,&quot; Garcia said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGarcia and others say Obama has also met with Francisco &quot;Pepe&quot; Hernandez, president of the Cuban America National Foundation. (Obama spoke to an audience of nearly 900 people about the need for a new Cuba policy at a CANF luncheon in 2008.) The leading exile group once opposed travel to Cuba but now supports it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur efforts to confirm that Hernandez met with Obama were unsuccessful. Three days of calls to CANF&nbsp;weren&#39;t returned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA spokeswoman for the White House declined to release details on any other meetings between&nbsp;Obama and&nbsp;Cuban exile leaders. She referred PolitiFact Florida to an online database that lists White House guests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the White House guests: Mauricio Claver-Carone, a lawyer who&#39;s against increased travel to Cuba and represents Cuba Democracy Public&nbsp;Advocacy. He visited 1600 Pennsylvania on <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/visitor-records\">Nov. 12, 2009,</a> according to the database.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It was not to advocate for or against anything,&quot; Claver-Carone said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClaver-Carone said he met with a presidential foreign policy adviser, not the president,&nbsp;but couldn&#39;t remember his name.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeparately, Obama has contacted&nbsp;island dissidents. In November 2009 he personally responded to an e-mail message from <em>Generaci&oacute;n Y</em> blogger Yoani S&aacute;nchez, telling her that her blog &quot;provides the world a unique window into the realities of daily life in Cuba.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRivera&#39;s claim is that &quot;In the past, President Obama has refused to meet with representatives from Cuban exile organizations.&quot; Certainly, he has not met with all the many exile groups -- but he clearly has met with some representatives. We think Rivera overstated in claiming no meetings at all, so we rate his claim False.&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-02T11:31:22.235460", "ruling_date": "2011-02-02T13:56:19", "ruling_headline": "David Rivera says Obama ignored the Cuban exile community", "ruling_headline_slug": "david-rivera-says-obama-ignored-cuban-exile-commun", "ruling_link_text": "At least, Obama hasn't met with Rivera's groups", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/10/12/1868719/obama-gives-democrats-a-pep-talk.html\">Obama gives Democrats a pep talk</a>,&quot; by Amy Sherman and Lesley Clark, <em>Miami Herald</em>, Oct. 12, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/04/15/1582146/in-florida-obama-finds-give-and.html\">In Florida, Obama finds give and take</a>,&quot; Patricia Mazzei, Lesley Clark, and Beth Reinhard, <em>Miami Herald</em>, April 16, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;<a href=\"http://www.cubaverdad.net/weblog/blogger-in-cuba-has-d-c-s-ears-not-rauls/\">Blogger in Cuba has D.C.&#39;s ears, not Ra&uacute;l&#39;s</a>.&quot; Juan O.
