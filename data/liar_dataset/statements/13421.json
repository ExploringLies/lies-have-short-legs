Ron Johnson, called a recent attack ad from Johnson&rsquo;s camp &quot;simply false&quot; and &quot;intentionally misleading.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad accused Feingold of starting his Progressives United committee to pay himself and his staff, not to support progressive candidates. (We rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/03/republican-party-wisconsin/did-russ-feingold-form-his-own-political-group-pay/\">Half True</a> a similar claim from the state GOP)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When speaking to reporters in Milwaukee October 27, Feingold said about the ad: &quot;They don&rsquo;t want to talk about the fact that Senator Johnson not only loves the current finance system, but he is the one who is benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took a look at claim about who benefitted from the Progressive&rsquo;s United fund. In this item, we are looking at Feingold&rsquo;s response: That Johnson is benefiting from several super PACs, but he is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if that was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unpacking the PACs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day after Feingold&rsquo;s statement, a major Democratic super PAC <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/28/big-money-pours-into-senate-race/92881452/\">announced</a> a $2 million ad buy on his behalf. But we&rsquo;re considering Feingold&rsquo;s claim at the time he made it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold himself has a history with campaign finance reform &mdash; he was half of the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which limited the amount of money national parties can raise and spend on behalf of their candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The act was an attempt to reign in spending, but <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/a-better-way-to-buy-politicians/\">some say</a> it pushed donors to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php\">super PACs</a> that can raise unlimited amounts of money but can&rsquo;t donate the money directly to a candidate. Which brings us to 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of Feingold&rsquo;s statement, both candidates had already benefited from super PACs, according to data from the Federal Election Committee&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/data/IndependentExpenditure.do?format=html&amp;cf=superPAC\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two super PACs &mdash; For Our Future and Working America Coalition &mdash; had spent around $50,000 to support Feingold. And four super PACs had spent around $950,000 to support Johnson: Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and Let America Work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, money spent to oppose a candidate also benefits the other and there was even more spent there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four super PACs spent almost $640,000 to oppose Johnson: For Our Future, Working America Coalition, Planned Parenthood Votes and the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And five super PACs spent more than $2.5 million to oppose Feingold: Americas PAC, Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, The New Prosperity Foundation and Reform Wisconsin Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So at the time of Feingold&rsquo;s statement, super PACs had reported spending around $690,000 on Feingold&rsquo;s behalf and nearly $3.5 million on Johnson&rsquo;s. (As noted, an additional $2 million was directed to Feingold the next day.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold&rsquo;s camp pointed to the fact that Johnson had benefited from a much larger share of super PAC spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe so. But that&rsquo;s not what Feingold said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold said Johnson is &quot;benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, he was. Though such spending for Johnson has been higher, Feingold has received significant super PAC support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating is False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-03T15:20:05.514743", "ruling_date": "2016-11-03T15:18:08", "ruling_headline": "Russ Feingold falsely claims only his opponent is benefiting from spending by super PACs", "ruling_headline_slug": "russ-feingold-falsely-claims-only-his-opponent-ben", "ruling_link_text": "Except for all those super PACS", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange with Michael Taylor, Feingold spokesman, November 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Ben Voelkel, Johnson spokesman, November 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/27/johnson-ad-hits-feingold-progressives-united-pac/92797188/\">Feingold defends PAC, hits Johnson on Trump</a>, Daily Tribune, October 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/russ-feingolds-pac-funded-salaries-for-former-staffers-himself-b99518602z1-307322531.html\">Russ Feingold&rsquo;s PAC funded fees, salaries for former staffers, himself</a>, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/a-better-way-to-buy-politicians/\">A better way to buy politicians</a>&quot;, New York Times, February 16, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/data/IndependentExpenditure.do?format=html&amp;cf=superPAC\">Federal Election Committee 2016 independent expenditure data catalog</a>, accessed November 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php\">Super PACs</a>, OpenSecrets.org, accessed November 2, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Russ ", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 528, "last_name": "Feingold", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "russ-feingold", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Russ_Feingold_Pfact_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/528/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.progressivesunited.org/about/russ-feingold"}, "statement": "<div>Says Ron Johnson &quot;is benefiting from several super PACs, I am not.&quot;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a meeting with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board.", "statement_date": "2016-10-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Ron", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 527, "last_name": "Johnson", "mostly_true_count": 13, "name_slug": "ron-johnson", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Ron_Johnson_Pfact_mug_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/527/", "total_count": 55, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.ronjohnsonforsenate.com/home/"}], "twitter_headline": "Russ Feingold falsely claims only his opponent is benefiting from spending by super PACs."}
