The top bracket is $9,000 and higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there&rsquo;s a catch. Greitens said people making $9,000 or more would fall in the top bracket. In fact, this chart applies not to how much a person earns but to that individual&rsquo;s taxable earnings &mdash; after any deductions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxable income vs. gross income</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxable income is gross income less all personal exemptions and deductions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Revenue allows the following standard deductions for Missouri taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Standard deductions for Missouri taxpayers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HIqpSwACZ1M65UUwUO-v2GCL1dird6n_zTtgFdNAFV7eXnKqVJWwelm9I2Lc8IGapxGAdlBeRzShrKCYf0XI0XIDDFwv0WmKjP-8x0v82lOaMsseodG8W2VkLZ7Zho3C4AKD7PRV\" style=\"border:none; height:302px; width:506px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chart shows a single filer can claim a standard deduction of $6,300. Therefore, if that person makes $9,000, as Greitens&rsquo; said, then he or she would only have a taxable income of $2,700 &mdash; even with no other exemptions. When we refer back to the department&rsquo;s tax bracket chart, we can see such an individual would fit into the state&rsquo;s fourth tax bracket instead of the highest tax bracket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All things being equal, a single filer would need to make at least $15,300 before he or she would face the highest tax rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Married people filing jointly, heads of household and surviving spouses could make more than $15,300 and still not be in the top bracket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greitens said, &quot;We have 10 different tax brackets, and if you&rsquo;re making $9,000, you&rsquo;re already in the top tax bracket.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plain meaning of &quot;making $9,000&quot; is that&rsquo;s how much a person earns. However, the Missouri tax brackets aren&rsquo;t based on gross income but on income after deductions and exemptions. Those reduce a person&rsquo;s taxable income, which is the basis of the chart Greitens had in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A person making $9,000 would fall in the fourth tax bracket, closer to the bottom, and certainly not at the top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people would understand Greitens to be talking about gross income, and in this case, his statement falls far short of the mark. We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-22T00:54:34.103406", "ruling_date": "2016-03-22T00:53:24", "ruling_headline": "Gubernatorial candidate exaggerates Missouri tax brackets", "ruling_headline_slug": "gubernatorial-candidate-exaggerates-missouri-tax-b", "ruling_link_text": "A misleading explanation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/elections/gubernatorial-candidates-spar-about-campaign-contributions-um-system-funding-cuts/article_5ef6542e-ec7c-11e5-be2f-0382d7afc3c6.html\">Gubernatorial candidates spar about campaign contributions, UM System funding cuts</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/state_news/fact-check-rep-kip-kendrick-half-right-on-voter-id/article_c728f976-ed66-11e5-8b87-5b0f1cc15b30.html\">FACT CHECK: Rep.
