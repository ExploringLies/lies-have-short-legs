Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., for example, said he would not support the plan because he considered the estate tax compromise a tax increase. We ruled that claim <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/13/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-proposed-tax-compromise-includ/\" id=\"sk7a\" title=\"Half True\">Barely True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a self-described democratic socialist, sent out a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/senatorsanders/statuses/14371471526723585#\" id=\"we_1\" title=\"message via twitter\">message via Twitter</a> on Dec. 13, 2010, saying that under the estate tax plan, &quot;99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on the rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to an <a href=\"http://taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/Content/PDF/T10-0269.pdf\" id=\"sx6f\" title=\"analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center\">analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, Sanders is correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Tax Policy Center estimated that about 99.7 percent of estates were exempt from the estate tax in 2009 when the first $3.5 million of an estate was exempt. Even fewer people would be subject to the tax if the threshold is increased to $5 million, as proposed in the compromise tax plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the compromise plan, less than 2/10 of 1 percent of estates would be subject to the estate tax next year, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. That means more than 99.8 percent would be completely exempt.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3,600 estates would be subject to the tax under the $5 million threshold. Those 3,600 estates would have to pay an estimated $11.4 billion in estate taxes under the compromise tax plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEstate tax rates have fluctuated through modern history. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same time increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax disappeared altogether in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the Bush plan only had a 10-year window because Republicans didn&#39;t have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. Barring a new tax agreement, the rate was set to revert next year to a 55 percent rate with an effective exemption of $1 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast year, Democrats proposed a plan to permanently set the estate tax rate at 2009 levels -- 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Had that plan gone through, the Tax Policy Center estimates it would have subjected 6,460 estates to a tax (bring in an estimated $18.2 billion). If no tax plan passes, and the rate goes back to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million, an 43,540 estates would have to pay (bringing in an estimated $34.4 billion next year).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSanders was correct that in 2009, when the effective exemption was $3.5 million, about 99.7 percent of all estates were exempt and didn&#39;t pay anything. The compromise plan -- which would set effective exemption at $5 million -- would push the number of exempted estates even higher, so that more than 99.8 percent of estates would not pay anything.
