And the conservative website <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/06/08/rumors-scott-walker-accept-nomination-trump-implodes-convention/\">RedState said</a> there were rumors of Walker being open to accepting the nomination at the convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/scott-walker-dismisses-rumors-he-would-accept-gop-nomination-if/article_713429ce-4abd-59aa-9e02-45ac3c426e3f.html\">dismissed the talk</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the new reports on Walker&rsquo;s viability as a Trump replacement were fueled by Walker&rsquo;s own comments the same day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s look at where Walker has been on Trump, starting with when Walker himself was still in the race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker&rsquo;s early comments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker launched his presidential bid in July 2015 and was quickly <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2015/07/13/scott-walker-launches-2016-campaign-as-a-gop-front-runner\">considered</a> <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article35992308.html\">a frontrunner</a>, even in the crowded GOP field. The next month, he was on stage with Trump and eight other hopefuls for <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-to-share-spotlight-with-trump-bush-in-first-debate-b99551932z1-320966051.html\">the first GOP debate</a>, held in Cleveland. The candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would not pledge to back the party&#39;s nominee and swear off an independent run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump was the only one to raise his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, Walker pledged he would back the GOP nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, at that stage, Walker himself hoped to be his party&rsquo;s choice, and it would be months before Trump became the presumptive nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/campaign-woes-prompt-scott-walker-to-focus-on-fundraising-b99580982z1-328523361.html\">ended his presidential bid</a> in September 2015, amid campaign cash-flow problems and a drop in the polls, &nbsp;Ahead of Wisconsin&rsquo;s primary in April 2016, Trump was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/donald-trump-hits-scott-walker-on-his-record-b99696853z1-373906441.html\">harshly</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-wisconsins-effective-unem/\">critical</a> of Walker, who endorsed U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/\">Ted Cruz</a> of Texas. Soon questions turned to whether Walker would back Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>April 20, 2016:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/376389691.html\">Walker told reporters</a>: &quot;I will support the Republican running against Hillary Clinton in the fall -- whoever that is.&quot; Asked if he would do so even if Trump were the nominee, he said: &quot;Yeah. To me, I think it&#39;s preferable to have a Republican nominee over Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>May 4, 2016:</strong> Alluding to the first GOP debate, <a href=\"http://fox6now.com/2016/05/04/with-cruz-and-kasich-out-gov-walker-says-donald-trump-is-clearly-better-than-hillary-clinton/\">Walker told reporters</a>&nbsp;the day after Cruz dropped out: &quot;I stood on the stage in Cleveland and said that I would support the nominee. I&rsquo;ve said it repeatedly since then and I&rsquo;ll be supporting the Republican nominee once that&rsquo;s officially set at the convention against Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>June 6, 2016:</strong> The <em>Post-Crescent</em> in Appleton <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-no-problem-supporting-trump-despite-differences-b99739368z1-382032461.html\">reported</a> that Walker said he would have no problem supporting Trump even though &quot;he wasn&#39;t my first choice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said in the interview:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are issues, not the least of which lately with his statements about the judge he commented on, which I just fundamentally disagree with him on, so just saying that I&#39;ll support him over Hillary Clinton doesn&#39;t mean I embrace all the things that he says or all the ways that he says it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Walker initially declared he would support the Republican nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, months later, as it became clear that Trump was closing in on the nomination, Walker repeatedly said he would support Trump -- though on at least one occasion he said his support once the GOP nomination becomes &quot;officially set.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to the Walker comments that made national headlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker&rsquo;s latest comments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>June 7, 2016: </strong>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> headline about Walker withholding a Trump endorsement was based on comments Walker made to reporters that were highlighted in a <a href=\"http://www.wkow.com/story/32166930/2016/06/07/gov-walker-calls-choice-between-trump-and-clinton-a-sad-one\">report</a> by WKOW-TV in Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker denounced Trump&rsquo;s comments about the judge and said he wanted Trump himself to renounce them, according to a reporter&rsquo;s recording of Walker&rsquo;s remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reporter then asked: &quot;Would that influence your decision at all on whether or not to back him as the nominee?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said: &quot;Again, we&rsquo;ll watch and see what happens. We&rsquo;ll be watching closely. There&rsquo;s still quite some time until he&rsquo;s even the nominee, so we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked what would cause him not to support Trump, Walker said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, again, he&rsquo;s not yet the nominee. Officially that won&#39;t happen until the middle of July, and so for me that&#39;s kind of the time frame on that. In particular, I want to make sure that he renounces what he says -- at least in regards to this judge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker added: &quot;I think for a lot of us, not just Republicans in general, we want to see what he&rsquo;s going to do between now and the time the convention comes. The sad fact is -- it&rsquo;s just sad in American that we have such poor choices right now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>June 8, 2016:</strong> After another question-and-answer session with reporters, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_268748/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=evzdYliw\">reported</a>, that Walker was wavering in his support of Trump and that he dodged a question on the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker was asked, according to a reporter&#39;s recording of that exchange: &quot;Do you still support him (Trump) as the nominee?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker began his response by saying: &quot;Well, right now I&#39;m focused on calling out, as I have the last couple days, the fact that I believe what he said about the judge is wrong -- not as a Republican, not as a political person, but I think it&#39;s just wrong as an American.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker went on at some length criticizing Trump&rsquo;s remarks, ending by saying: &quot;He needs to make it abundantly clear to the American people that he does not embrace those ideas. And I think it&rsquo;s particularly important between now and the convention that he does that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dating back to August 2015, when he himself was a candidate for president, Walker said he would support the Republican presidential nominee. And several times over the next 10 months, Walker repeated that pledge -- including as it was becoming clear that Trump would be the presumptive nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on two consecutive days in June 2016, Walker shifted somewhat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questioned about Trump by reporters, Walker would not state his support as he had in the past. Instead, while criticizing Trump, he emphasized that Trump is not yet the nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our definition of Half Flip is a partial change of position or inconsistent statements.
