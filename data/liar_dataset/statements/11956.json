Ted Cruz is slamming Trump on the issue in a campaign ad airing just days before the Nevada Republican presidential caucus on Feb. 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Eighty-five percent of Nevada is owned and regulated by the federal government,&quot; says Cruz in the ad. &quot;And Donald Trump wants to keep big government in charge.
