The polls generally showed most Americans had an unfavorable opinion of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But surprisingly for Ryan, who is regarded as a federal budget expert, his claim about the law flies in the face of evidence that it actually helps shore up Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the ACA did on Medicare</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de6b429-1d9a-42de-ad08-c7998eaa6ca5\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de6b429-1d9a-42de-ad08-c7998eaa6ca5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how <a href=\"http://crfb.org/biography/staff/marc-goldwein\">Marc Goldwein</a>, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, lays it out:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one side of the ledger, Obamacare slowed the growth of Medicare spending by, among other things, reducing increases in payments made to nearly all health care providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other side of the ledger, the law included a surtax on high-income earners that brings more money into Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two health care policy experts further told us that the combination of spending curbs and revenue increases for <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/part-a/what-part-a-covers.html\">Medicare Part A</a> -- which covers hospital, nursing home and home care services, and is financed mainly through payroll taxes -- has extended the solvency of Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Medicare Part B, which is voluntary, covers doctor visits and some medical care.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://priceschool.usc.edu/paul-b-ginsburg/\">Paul Ginsburg</a>, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at the University of Southern California, pointed us to an <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20946.pdf#page=8\">October 2016 report</a> from the nonpartisan&nbsp;Congressional Research Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report noted that in 2010, the Medicare trustees projected that Obamacare&rsquo;s spending curbs and revenue increases would mean Medicare&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/about-us/how-medicare-is-funded/medicare-funding.html\">Hospital Insurance Trust Fund</a>, which finances Part A, would remain solvent until 2029.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s 12 years later than had been projected a year before the Affordable Care Act&nbsp;became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The projection has since been revised <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20946.pdf#page=8\">to 2028</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/mss16\">Michael Sparer</a>, a professor health policy and management at Columbia University in New York, put it this way, financially speaking:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Obamacare were repealed completely, &quot;it would put Medicare in worse shape, not better shape.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s worth noting that both <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/broke-and-because-of-aca/\">Factcheck.org</a> and the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/14/paul-ryans-false-claim-that-because-of-obamacare-medicare-is-going-broke/?utm_term=.324ca7fb5ee0\">Fact Checker</a> also concluded that Ryan&rsquo;s claim is wrong. They both also noted that, even if the Part A trust fund did become depleted in 2028, the program wouldn&rsquo;t be broke, in that it is still set up to cover an estimated 87 percent of expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org&rsquo;s rating was false and the Fact Checker gave Ryan its worst rating, four Pinnocchios, which is for statements deemed to be &quot;whoppers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan&rsquo;s office opted not to provide us any information to support his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan said: &quot;Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financially, Medicare isn&rsquo;t entirely in the clear, given that actuaries project that a key reserve fund will run out of money in 2028.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Medicare trustees themselves, along with a host of experts, say the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s changes to Medicare -- including holding the line on spending and raising taxes -- actually puts Medicare in better shape than before the law was adopted. That&rsquo;s a long way from making Medicare go broke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Ryan&rsquo;s statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-21T13:56:31.491184", "ruling_date": "2016-12-23T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "With 'repeal and replace' in the works, Paul Ryan claims Obamacare is making Medicare go broke", "ruling_headline_slug": "repeal-and-replace-works-paul-ryan-says-obamacare-", "ruling_link_text": "It's actually shoring up Medicare's finances", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/11/10/paul-ryan-special-report-donald-trump-republican-congress\">Paul Ryan interview</a> (6:00), Nov. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Paul Ryan press secretary Ian Martorana, Dec. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget senior vice president and senior policy director <a href=\"http://crfb.org/biography/staff/marc-goldwein\">Marc Goldwein</a>, Dec. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/blog/to-repeat-medicare-isnt-going-bankrupt\">&quot;To Repeat: Medicare Isn&rsquo;t Going &lsquo;Bankrupt,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Dec. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressoinal Research Service, <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20946.pdf#page=8\">&quot;Medicare: Insolvency Projections,&quot;</a> Oct. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, University of Southern California professor of the practice of health policy and management Paul Ginsburg, Dec. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Urban Institute Health Policy Center co-director <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/author/stephen-zuckerman\">Stephen Zuckerman</a>, Dec. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Columbia University professor health policy and management Michael Sparer, Dec. 20, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 24, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 373, "last_name": "Ryan", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "paul-ryan", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_WX201_HOUSE_2016_PRIMARI.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/373/", "total_count": 89, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.house.gov/ryan/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2016-11-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 45, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/45/", "subject": "Bankruptcy", "subject_slug": "bankruptcy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
