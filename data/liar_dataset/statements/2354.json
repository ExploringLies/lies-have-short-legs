Kristi Thibaut, D-Houston. &quot;Dem State Rep Kristi Thibaut was an #ACORN lobbyist,&quot; the party tweeted Aug. 31, linking to a web video. Earlier the same day, the party had tweeted: &quot;Democrat State Rep. Kristi Thibaut, HD133, was a lobbyist for corrupt ACORN&quot; and before that, &quot;find out which Dem state Rep was a lobbyist for ACORN.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in March 2010 after a video sting showed ACORN employees in one office telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/23acorn.html\">how to conceal their criminal activities</a>. The 40-year-old, liberal-leaning group, which sought more affordable housing options, a universal health care system and increased voter access, also faced questions &mdash; mainly from conservatives &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/article852295.ece\">about its voter registration drives</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCongress cut off federal funding to the group in September 2009.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we asked the Republican Party to substantiate its claim, spokesman Bryan Preston pointed us to the website <a href=\"http://kristiworksforacorn.com/\">kristiworksforacorn.com,</a> where the party posted its research. The web page features a photo of Thibaut with President Obama and links to the web video, which starts with a 2008 audio clip of Thibaut being asked about legislation she&#39;d like to see passed in 2009. &quot;There&#39;s a bill that we got behind and supported... we being ACORN,&quot; she says. &quot;Being Acorn&quot; is repeated in a sound loop, then the web video jumps to TV news coverage of the ACORN-related uproar.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe GOP notes that according to Thibaut&#39;s lobby report filed with the Texas Ethics Commission, Thibaut was registered as an ACORN lobbyist in 2007, and expected to earn between $10,000 and $25,000. Also, Thibaut appeared April 25, 2007, on behalf of ACORN at a committee hearing about a proposed constitutional amendment related to home equity loans, according to a Texas House list of witnesses posted online.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso noted on the GOP site: a Feb. 4, 2009, Texas Observer article profiling Thibaut and calling her an &quot;ACORN activist&quot; who unsuccessfully lobbied state lawmakers during the 2007 session for lower utility rates.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe confirmed each of the party&#39;s citations from state records.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNext, Keir Murray, a spokesman for Thibaut&#39;s campaign, told us Thibaut was a contract lobbyist for ACORN for the 2007 legislative session. Murray said she &quot;specifically lobbied around the issue of utility rate reduction and affordable housing.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;She&#39;s proud of the work she did on behalf of low- and moderate-income Texans,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ve never hid from this.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn an e-mail, Murray suggested the GOP attack is a red herring: &quot;This is a real stretch to equate her work here in Texas, where ACORN was never, to my knowledge, implicated in any &#39;fraud,&#39; with the salacious accusations leveled at the organization in other states.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere was no evidence of ACORN-driven voter registration fraud in Harris Country &mdash; Thibaut&#39;s home turf &mdash; according to a October 2008 Houston Chronicle article.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, Thibaut lobbied for ACORN, as the GOP tweet says and her campaign acknowledges, though the linked web video associates Thibaut with ACORN&#39;s voter-registration fraud and tax evasion issues; there&#39;s no evidence of Thibaut having a connection to such activities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFar as it goes, the GOP statement we reviewed is True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-08T13:42:03.948611", "ruling_date": "2010-09-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "The Republican Party of Texas says Rep.
