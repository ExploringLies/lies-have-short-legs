That&#39;s $216 more than the average for the rest of the states, not $460.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the five-state average is only $1.80 per person more than the lone state with NO Democrats in its congressional delegation -- Wyoming.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt turns out that the e-mail is quoting part of a March 23, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/23/where-did-stimulus-money-really-go/#ixzz1pwo9sJHL\">opinion column</a> at FoxNews.com by economist John R. Lott Jr.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCo-author (with conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist) of &quot;Debacle: Obama&#39;s War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future,&quot; Lott examines whether the states that needed the money most actually received it. We contacted him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLott sent us his spreadsheet that turned out to have more up-to-date -- and therefore larger -- <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/agency/Pages/StateTotalsByAgency.aspx\">numbers</a> showing how much had been awarded by state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce again, we segregated the five all-Democrat states and looked at the average. It was $1,787 per resident.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s an extra $338 per capita compared with the other states, but still significantly below $460.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where did Lott&#39;s number come from?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you create <a href=\"http://johnrlott.blogspot.com/2012/03/did-stimulus-dollars-go-to-states-with.html\">a graph</a> that shows how much a state received per capita on one side and the percentage of Democrats in the congressional delegation on the other, you get a graph that looks like 50 drops of paint spattered against a wall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in this case, there is a pattern to that spattering. Lott uncovered it with a statistical analysis that turned the scattershot data into a straight line, indicating the overall trend. The lesson of the line: whenever Democratic representation increased by 10 percentage points, the per-person allotment in the state increased by $46.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThus, he said, by that measure, going from 0 percent Democratic representation to 100 percent gives you an extra $460.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlenty of individual states don&#39;t conform to this, as demonstrated by the fact that, using Lott&#39;s data, the only all-Republican state of Wyoming got more money than two of the five all-Democrat states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Lott did not include the District of Columbia, which has all Democrats in its non-voting delegation and has received five times more stimulus money per resident than the national average.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLott&#39;s analysis on FoxNews.com make it clear that he is looking at trends, noting, for example, that &quot;each one percentage point reduction in the percent of a state&#39;s workforce represented by unions saw a $26 drop in stimulus dollars per person.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the e-mail stripped out that context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo why would the Democrat-heavy states get more money?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats controlled the House and the Senate at the time the legislation was written and one provision, Lott said, was that &quot;a lot of the funding could only go for union jobs.&quot; &nbsp;Heavily&nbsp;Democratic areas are more likely to have unions, including government employee unions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>OUR RULING</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe chain e-mail says, &quot;Having an entirely Democrat congressional delegation in 2009, when the [stimulus] bill passed, increases the per capita stimulus dollars that the state receives per person by $460.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe original author of the claim calculated $460 using a sophisticated analysis to find a trend that considers the varying degree of Democrat and Republican representation in <em>all</em> states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&#39;s a different question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you compare the all-Democrat states to all the other states, the correct number is closer to $338.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo states with a purely Democrat congressional delegation have, in fact, garnered quite a bit more money per capita than other states. But because the $460 amount is off by about 36 percent, we rate the statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Half True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
