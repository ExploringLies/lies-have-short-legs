Kriseman&rsquo;s campaign plucked the worst year to make its counterpunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 2006 was the highest point for auto thefts since 2000 &mdash; although most other years were higher than any point in Kriseman&rsquo;s three full years since taking office in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing to compare raw numbers from Baker&#39;s 2008 and Kriseman&#39;s 2015, though, could leave a different impression, with 1,461 and 1,523 thefts, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does the bigger story tell you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate of car thefts in St. Petersburg remains&nbsp;far higher than the national and state average, shown below, regardless of who was mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The number of auto-thefts, the number of auto burglaries, it&rsquo;s something you need to watch and something that&rsquo;s important, but the impact of the activity is more important than anything else,&quot; Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in recent years, the impact of automobile thefts, specifically juvenile auto thefts, has been a priority for the department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> documented the <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/investigations/florida-pinellas-auto-theft-kids-hot-wheels/car-theft-epidemic/\">automobile theft</a> issue, finding that children in Pinellas County were arrested more for stealing cars than anywhere else in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gualtieri said 2015 was &quot;ground zero&quot; for the juvenile auto-theft problem and said that&rsquo;s when the department really started noticing the trend of young kids stealing cars. In early 2016, three teenage girls drove a stolen car into a cemetery pond and drowned. At the time, Gualtieri called the incident &quot;unacceptable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Solutions need to come deep from within the community,&quot; Gualtieri <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/deputies-search-pond-near-gandy-boulevard-after-stolen-vehicle-plunges/2271365\">said</a> at the time. &quot;Kids need to know there are consequences. This is a systematic and complex problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automobile thefts became a priority for police in 2015 and 2016 &mdash; leading to a year-over-year drop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law enforcement officials consider juvenile auto thefts a countywide problem; a drop in St. Petersburg doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the problem is over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detective Paul Etcheson, who&rsquo;s been with the police department for almost nine years and works in the property crime unit, described automobile theft in St. Petersburg as a &quot;revolving door.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The reason the numbers have fallen in the previous months is because we have juveniles placed in programs, or on 21-day hold or something,&quot; he said. &quot;As soon as they get back, they&rsquo;re right back at it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we said, 2006 was a high point for auto theft. We wanted to understand why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Police officer Mark Williams, who has been with the deparment for over a decade, said cars were simply&nbsp;easier to steal in 2005 and 2006 like the Dodge Ram 1500. Older cars&nbsp;could be broken into with a screwdriver or a pair of scissors, he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams said automakers have done a better job of eliminating access points on cars. For instance, key holes are only on the driver side rather than on all doors. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to Kriseman&rsquo;s image, Baker said, &quot;I&rsquo;ve been to 50 neighborhood organizations in the last six months and if Rick Kriseman thinks he doesn&rsquo;t have an auto theft problem, he needs to get out more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman&rsquo;s campaign emphasized the mayor is still concerned about automobile thefts, and said the image was meant to undermine Baker&rsquo;s remark that automobile theft is at &quot;epidemic proportions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman pushed back against Baker calling the auto-theft problem an &quot;epidemic&quot; with a graphic that&nbsp;said there were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Baker and 1,095 auto thefts in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers are accurate, but more information is needed to understand the full story. Kriseman cherry-picked the year of Baker&rsquo;s two terms with the highest amount of theft and compared it with his lowest year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To his overall point, the automobile theft per capita in St. Petersburg has been significantly higher than the national and state rates, regardless of who was in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-27T12:10:54.330729", "ruling_date": "2017-07-27T14:21:17", "ruling_headline": "Taking a closer look at the auto-theft problem in St. Petersburg", "ruling_headline_slug": "taking-closer-look-auto-theft-problem-st-petersbur", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers alone lack context", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Jacob Smith, Rick Kriseman&rsquo;s campaign manager, July 25-27 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Brigitta Shouppe, campaign spokeswoman for Rick Baker, July 25</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, St. Petersburg Police Chief Tony Holloway, July 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, July 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Detective Paul Etcheson with the St. Petersburg Police Department, July 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Officer Mark Williams, July 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews, St. Petersburg Police Department spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez, July 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/RunCrimeJurisbyJurisLarge.cfm\">FBI UCR Data</a>, 2000-2014, property crime rates, crime reported by St. Petersburg Police Dept, Florida, accesses July 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeStatebyState.cfm\">FBI UCR Data</a>, 2000-2014, property crime rates, estimated crime in United States -Total, accessed July 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/RunCrimeStatebyState.cfm\">FBI UCR Data</a>, 2000-2014, property crime rates, estimated crime in Florida, accessed July 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://police.stpete.org/community/docs/2016-ucr-annual-report.pdf\">St. Petersburg police department</a>, motor vehicle theft, 2015-16</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/investigations/florida-pinellas-auto-theft-kids-hot-wheels/car-theft-epidemic/\">Tampa Bay Times</a>, &quot;Hot Wheels,&quot; April 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/5-ways-officials-are-trying-to-stop-pinellas-teenage-car-thieves/2331088\">Tampa Bay Times</a>, &quot;5 ways officials are trying to stop Pinellas&#39; teenage car thieves,&quot; July 21</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/deputies-search-pond-near-gandy-boulevard-after-stolen-vehicle-plunges/2271365\">Tampa Bay Times</a>, &quot;Three teenage girls dead after stolen car plunges into St. Petersburg pond,&quot; March 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "State Representative", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 1440, "last_name": "Kriseman", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "rick-kriseman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rick-kriseman1a.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1440/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.kriseman.com/"}, "statement": "<p>There were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Rick Baker and 1,095 auto thefts in 2016.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "posts on Twitter and Facebook", "statement_date": "2017-07-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 173, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/173/", "subject": "Public Safety", "subject_slug": "public-safety", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Taking a closer look at the auto-theft problem in St. Petersburg"}
