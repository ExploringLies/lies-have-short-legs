It is. The story took a quote by a <a href=\"http://www.whwg.com/principals/brett-m-decker/\">consultant </a>who served in George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration and and falsely attributed it to Parton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Brett Decker&nbsp;spoke about consumer confidence and the economy. in a radio interview with <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/01/06/brett-decker-trump-one-year-already-better-16-years-of-bush-obama-put-together/\">Breitbart</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of those guys put together,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Americanproud.info story also used an actual quote by Parton in an interview with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/26/politics/dolly-parton-presidential-candidates/index.html\">CNN in August 2016</a>, but omitted the full context of her comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re doing good,&quot; Parton told CNN. &quot;We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we&rsquo;ve certainly come a long way in that respect.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americanpround.info included that snippet in its report, but went on to say that Parton &quot;saw the light&quot; and later called Hillary Clinton &quot;nuts&quot; and that her campaign has been &quot;just crazy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, all those comments were actually from the same CNN interview, but Americanproud.info distorted what Parton actually said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/26/politics/dolly-parton-presidential-candidates/index.html\">asked about Clinton and Trump</a>, here&rsquo;s Parton&rsquo;s full remarks:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know where they&#39;re going to land but I think they&#39;re both nuts&quot; she said, joking that &quot;it&#39;s like watching the OJ Simpson trial. You just believe whoever&#39;s up next. Whoever testified last is who you believe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the CNN interview, Parton doesn&rsquo;t come across as committed to either candidate. CNN paraphrased her as saying she might not know who she will vote for and that it&#39;s time that both Trump and Clinton stopped talking about each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2016, the <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/arts/music/dolly-parton-is-proud-of-her-gay-fans-and-hillary-clinton.html\">New York Times</a></em> asked Parton how she felt about a female presidential nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, I think that that would be wonderful. Hillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has. I think no matter if it&rsquo;s Hillary or Donald Trump, we&rsquo;re gonna be plagued with PMS either way &mdash; presidential mood swings! But I personally think a woman would do a great job. I think Hillary&rsquo;s very qualified. So if she gets it, I&rsquo;ll certainly be behind her.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After much publicity about that quote, Parton issued a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My comment about supporting a woman in the White House was taken out of context. I have not endorsed Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. I try not to get political but if I am, I might as well just run myself &#39;cause I&#39;ve got the hair for it, it&#39;s huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proclaiming that a celebrity now loves Trump or hates Clinton is a common theme in fake news stories. We debunked an article that said <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/04/flash-24-daily/no-sandra-bullock-didnt-disparage-hillary-clinton/\">Sandra Bullock said to Clinton </a>&quot;if you don&rsquo;t like our president you can leave and never come back again&quot; and that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/28/usa-daily-portal/fake-news-julia/\">&quot;Julia Roberts claims &lsquo;Michelle Obama isn&rsquo;t fit to clean Melania&rsquo;s toilet&rsquo; &quot;</a> We rated both statements Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the story that said Parton said, &quot;Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of Bush, Obama put together&quot; is also fake news. A consultant actually made a statement that virtually mirrors that quote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this story Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-01T17:07:49.677062", "ruling_date": "2018-02-05T14:59:26", "ruling_headline": "No, Dolly Parton didn't say Trump is better than Bush and Obama combined", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-dolly-parton-didnt-say-trump-better-bush-and-ob", "ruling_link_text": "Facts way out of tune", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>American News, <a href=\"http://www.americanproud.info/2018/01/22/singer-dolly-parton-trump-in-one-year-is-already-better-than-16-years-of-bush-obama-put-together-this-stupid-liberals-doing-everything-to-impeach-him-but-we-stan/\">&quot;Singer Dolly Parton: &quot;Trump in one year is already better than 16 Years&rsquo; of Bush, Obama &lsquo;Put Together,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Jan. 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/01/06/brett-decker-trump-one-year-already-better-16-years-of-bush-obama-put-together/\">&quot;Brett Decker: &lsquo;Trump in one year is already better than 16 years&rsquo; of Bush, Obama &lsquo;put together,&rsquo;&quot; </a>Jan. 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/26/politics/dolly-parton-presidential-candidates/index.html\">&quot;Dolly Parton on 2016 candidates: &#39;I think they&#39;re both nuts,&#39;&quot;</a> Aug. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/arts/music/dolly-parton-is-proud-of-her-gay-fans-and-hillary-clinton.html\">&quot;Dolly Parton Is Proud of Her Gay Fans and Hillary Clinton,&quot;</a> June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today</em> Network, &quot;Emmy Awards - Parton at the center of Trump flap,&quot; Sept. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Writers Group, <a href=\"http://www.whwg.com/principals/brett-m-decker/\">Brett M.
