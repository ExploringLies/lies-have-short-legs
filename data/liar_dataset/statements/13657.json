That number is down from 2015, when 280 people were killed; and up from 2014, when 248 people were killed. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homicides since the mid 2000s, however, are way down. In 2007, Philly had 391 murders. Go back to the 1990s, and Philadelphia&rsquo;s murder rate was even higher. Five hundred people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.phillypolice.com/assets/crime-maps-stats/PPD.Homicide.Analysis.2007-2010.pdf\">were killed in 1990</a>. The murder rate decreased throughout the 1990s before going back up in the early 2000s and falling since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 277 people killed in 2016 is the third-lowest amount since 1990 and down about 45 percent from the 1990 peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to White House spokesperson Steven N. Cheung for comment. We&rsquo;ll update if we hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement Thursday afternoon saying the president&rsquo;s comments were &quot;insulting&quot; to police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our police officers have worked tirelessly and with great personal sacrifice&nbsp;to get Philadelphia&rsquo;s crime rate down to its lowest point in forty years, while also successfully&nbsp;implementing reforms to strengthen police-community relations and uphold the rights of all our residents,&quot; he said in the statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He continued: &quot;Our homicides are, in fact,&nbsp;slowly declining, and while we are not satisfied with even our current numbers, we are&nbsp;handicapped by Republican refusal to enact any kind of common sense gun control and by their obsession with turning our police officers into ICE agents&nbsp;&mdash; which will&nbsp;prevent immigrants from coming forward to report crimes or provide critical witnesses statements that can put dangerous criminals behind bars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Donald Trump, while addressing the GOP Retreat at the Loews Hotel, said, &quot;Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady &mdash; I mean &mdash; just terribly increasing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The murder rate was higher last year than it was in 2014 and 2013, but it was lower than in 2015 and the third-lowest it has been since 1990.
