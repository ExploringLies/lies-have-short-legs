What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise&hellip; Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention,&quot; the story reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story used a quote of L&oacute;pez Obrador for which they cited the Daily Caller to back up their point:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot; &lsquo;And soon, very soon &mdash; after the victory of our movement &mdash; we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,&rsquo; L&oacute;pez Obrador said, adding that immigrants &lsquo;must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.&rsquo; He then declared it as &lsquo;a human right we will defend.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found the original quote in the Mexican newspaper, <em><a href=\"http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/amlo-urge-epn-detener-actos-racistas-e-inhumanas-de-eu-migrantes\">El Universal</a>.&nbsp; </em>It has<em>&nbsp;</em>been taken out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Y ya pronto, muy pronto, al triunfo de nuestro movimiento vamos a defender a los migrantes de todo el continente Americano y todos los migrantes del mundo que, por necesidad, tienen que abandonar sus pueblos para buscar la vida en Estados Unidos, es un derecho humano que vamos a defender,&quot; <em>El Universal</em> quotes L&oacute;pez Obrador saying in a speech on June 19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That translates to: &quot;Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States; it&rsquo;s a human right we will defend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&oacute;pez Obrador is not telling anyone to flood the border, but saying that he will defend those who find themselves with no other option but to relocate to the United States. The quote was delivered in the wake of news of the Trump administration&rsquo;s rampant separation of families at the border. Over 2,300 children were <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-children-at-the-border-by-the-numbers/\">separated</a> from their parents between May 5 and June 9, according to the Homeland Security Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no indications that L&oacute;pez Obrador was encouraging people to abandon their towns in favor of the United States. Instead, he urged current Mexican President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto to complete the following three actions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Send a diplomatic note in protest of the Trump&rsquo;s administration&rsquo;s policies to the United States;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Solicit the urgent intervention of the United Nations commissioner for human rights; and,</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Send a team of lawyers, psychologists and social workers to aid kids and their parents at the border.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers have distorted L&oacute;pez Obrador&#39;s quote to stoke fears.
