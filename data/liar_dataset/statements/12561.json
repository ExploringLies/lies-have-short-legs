After watching&nbsp;the video, which was from a website called SourceFed, Fox News&rsquo; chief judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/06/16/fox-friends-hypes-conspiracy-google-manipulating-searches-bury-bad-stuff-clinton/210990\">accused Google of hiding</a> Clinton&rsquo;s problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The clip that we just ran is the result of a very extensive test, an examination, about whether or not attempts to find things like, &lsquo;crime,&rsquo; &lsquo;criminal activity,&rsquo; &lsquo;indictment,&rsquo; have been filtered out by Google, and we know that it has,&quot; Napolitano said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to find out for ourselves if Google manipulates search suggestions in favor of Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Napolitano did not return emails seeking comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SourceFed video, posted on YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxFRqNmXKg\">June 9</a>, shows how certain terms, when searched with Clinton&rsquo;s name, don&rsquo;t autocomplete as suggestions underneath the search bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when users search &quot;Hillary Clinton cri,&quot; the suggested searches are &quot;Hillary Clinton crime reform,&quot; &quot;Hillary Clinton crisis,&quot; &quot;Hillary Clinton criticizes obama 2008&quot; and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No suggestions for &quot;Hillary Clinton crime&quot; itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jh6DsfBHr1WROip9ieROk5yti8pEF7XZBVXLjE_o1UM5yeTsARt9HNTXKPP_OMilOJcuC_yQv9v8mzRxmINy6qFJODbNwjc_jgvfFFPaFa0wzY5HZWDThJv23OQQ6RTkJU0q6CRU\" style=\"border:none; height:227px; width:411px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Bing and Yahoo bring up &quot;crimes&quot; and related returns when you search &quot;Hillary Clinton cri.&quot;<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DfAl_x8FJPSFgFMI2F2ipZRoxd8DLw6ool6GICL6wov8kuQVRObkzHS2dfsfaivxl_jQxE4ZX1rnYglKvUe7eLeYx3aaR30VcJ9KQ5VxtXIVh5V7NXi7INNIIfOZJHX3WJ0pXPwH\" style=\"border:none; height:301px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QiJ116qZwzi8eIFlDXI67srnGNHB85GuM_TMDFdwTUPTnoeOy70Yda7mltiJG8UF8cknjh3sA_O_gRlCrEoJ8IR0p4p0nD47Dl6tlu05I-08Kf07a6hFnOA2ytECl1Ot95lsqrRJ\" style=\"border:none; height:261px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Searching for the truth</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SourceFed clarified its original video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6ki2QKVa_8\">with another one June 10</a>, which included comment from Google denying the accusation. <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/10/technology/hillary-clinton-google-search-results/\">CNN Money also put its two-cents in the mix</a>, saying Google&rsquo;s algorithm was set up to filter-out offensive information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement, a Google spokesperson says the filter &quot;operates according to the same rules, no matter who the person is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person&rsquo;s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging,&quot; <a href=\"https://search.googleblog.com/2016/06/google-search-autocomplete.html\">the statement says</a>. &quot;We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement linked to a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/10/11903028/hillary-clinton-google-debunked\">Vox article</a> that refutes the idea Google is manipulating autocomplete in favor of Hillary Clinton. The article says that most people who are accused of crimes&nbsp;but were not convicted&nbsp;will not show up in suggestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to test Vox&rsquo;s theory, so we searched &quot;Casey Anthony cri&quot; and &quot;George Zimmerman cri.&quot; Both were suspects in criminal murder investigations and were acquitted.

She said major search engines update algorithms frequently to assimilate to the &quot;changing online environment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Algorithms have to be clever to show the best few choices, according to very complex measures of &lsquo;best,&#39; &quot; Hearst said. &quot;No doubt there are filters for curse words, and as time has gone by and the tenor of our times are getting more divisive, I would not be surprised if an algorithm has been developed to detect terms that feel offensive to a large segment of the population.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Napolitano accused America&#39;s most popular search engine, Google, of scrubbing search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Although it is clear Google&rsquo;s algorithm is different from Bing or Yahoo, it still isn&rsquo;t correct to describe the difference as evidence of Google&rsquo;s support of Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google&rsquo;s suggested searches, for the most part, avoid offensive suggestions for everyone, not just Clinton. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Napolitano&rsquo;s claim has a thread of truth, but it leaves out key details that would give the reader a different impression.
