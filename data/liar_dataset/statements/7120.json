PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKucinich builds his case first by noting that childhood obesity -- which has more than tripled in the past 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- has been linked to the influence of targeted marketing, though &quot;partial blame does lie with a more sedentary lifestyle and a worsening diet.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe cites several prominent studies in support, with the most recent study coming from the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences. It says: &quot;Aggressive marketing of high-calorie foods to children and adolescents has been identified as one of the major contributors to childhood obesity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Others with the same conclusion included the American Heart Association, the American Journal of Public Health and the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKucinich&#39;s bill would prohibit any company from claiming a tax deduction for the expense of marketing that is directed at children &quot;to promote the consumption of food at fast food restaurants or of food of poor nutritional quality.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder current law, fast food marketers get the same break that other businesses do. The federal tax code allows companies to deduct &quot;reasonable and necessary&quot; expenses of marketing and advertising from their income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow is that a subsidy?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The way the federal funding system works,&quot; Kucinich said, &quot;is that if we give a tax break in one place, we need to replace that lost income from somewhere else, like with higher taxes from the rest of us. In other words, this tax break is a massive subsidy for the junk food and fast food industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe question then is how much the deduction, or tax break, is worth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a report to Congress from the Federal Trade Commission, the most recent we could find, the fast food industry spent nearly $2 billion in 2006 on marketing and advertising specifically aimed at children. That would yield about $700 million in tax revenue at the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA report in the New England Journal of Medicine put the marketing budgets for &quot;kids&#39; foods&quot; at $10 billion annually -- which would yield $3.5 billion in revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA study in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity said &quot;it It is unclear how much money is spent on food advertising specifically directed at children and adolescents,&quot; but put the total for advertising, youth-targeted promotions and public relations and packaging especially designed for children at $10.5 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Economic Policy Institute estimated 10-year tax savings of $15 billion through legislation to &quot;end subsidies for junk and fast food advertising to children to promote health.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKucinich relied on Congress&rsquo; nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which estimated &quot;on a very preliminary basis&quot; that his legislation could raise $15 billion to $19 billion in additional federal revenue over the 10-year budget period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat is as much as $19 billion, as Kucinich asserted, though the committee also noted that unsettled issues surrounding his bill would affect its impact and the revenue it would raise. Those issues primarily include defining &quot;fast food&quot; and determining what advertising is &quot;primarily directed at children.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&#39;s our take-home?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact examined Kucinich&#39;s legislation two years ago, when he made a statement about it that we found relied too firmly on a high-end estimate of its potential tax saving and implied a direct cash payout by taxpayers to the food industry. He chose his words more carefully this time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis assertion that the tax code provides a subsidy of &quot;as much as $19 billion&quot; needs additional information for clarification, but it is well supported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-25T11:55:40.500064", "ruling_date": "2012-11-26T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Dennis Kucinich says the tax code effectively subsidizes fast food and junk food marketing that targets children", "ruling_headline_slug": "dennis-kucinich-says-tax-code-effectively-subsidiz", "ruling_link_text": "Serious support for bad eating habits", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRep.
