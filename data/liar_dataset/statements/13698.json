The report is actually worthless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Barrack Obama will be on new $1 dollar bill 2017,&quot; reads a headline on a <a href=\"http://trueamericans.me/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017\">Jan. 26, 2017, post </a>on TrueAmericans.me. It included a illustration (shown above) of what such a dollar may look like. The same site posted a poll asking readers <a href=\"http://trueamericans.me/poll-do-you-want-to-see-barack-obama-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017\">whether they supported the move</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim was flagged by Facebook, which is trying to crack down on fabricated articles that resemble real news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The false story, complete with the misspelling of &quot;Barack,&quot; <a href=\"http://healthyworldhouse.com/index.php/2017/01/18/barrack-obama-will-new-1-dollar-bill-2017/\">appeared</a> <a href=\"http://usinfonews.com/index.php/2017/01/23/must-read-barrack-obama-will-new-1-dollar-bill-2017/\">on several</a> <a href=\"http://www.anonjekloy.tk/2017/01/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar.html\">other</a> <a href=\"http://damnleaks.com/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017/\">websites</a> in January. The story says Obama will displace George Washington, and that the public will be able to help choose from among several designs &mdash; in early 2016. That&rsquo;s an easy clue that this fake story is both wrong and outdated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Obama will not be going on the $1 bill, although some new bill designs (<a href=\"http://time.com/4593420/harriet-tubman-20-bill-donald-trump-design/\">including a $20 featuring Harriet Tubman</a>) are in the works. The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing says there are <a href=\"https://www.moneyfactory.gov/uscurrency/1note.html\">no plans to redesign the $1 bill</a>, because it&rsquo;s seldom the target of counterfeiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also some legal roadblocks. The U.S. Treasury does not permit <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Currency/Pages/edu_faq_currency_portraits.aspx\">living people to be on currency notes</a>, and Congress has prohibited a redesign of the single greenback <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/12/redesign-dollar-syringes-immigrants-imf-ideas-in-omnibus-bill-000012\">in its omnibus spending measures</a>. The vending machine lobby <a href=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/63007\">convinced lawmakers to leave the dollar alone</a>, mostly because it would be expensive for vendors to upgrade bill readers to recognize cash sans Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell where the idea of Obama headlining the base unit of American currency originated, but contrived news stories about it go back to at least 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supermarket tabloid <em>Weekly World News</em> ran a story falsely saying the Obama administration had <a href=\"http://weeklyworldnews.com/politics/22345/obama-on-new-dollar-bill/\">approved a new design for all bills</a>, including a dollar featuring the 44th president that would be worth 47 cents. The story made reference to the Dollar ReDe$ign Project, a branding experiment going back to 2010 that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/16/15-amazing-new-designs-fo_n_719913.html\">solicited new currency designs</a>. Other <a href=\"http://americannews.com/article-claims-obamas-face-will-be-put-on-new-dollar-bill/\">blogs reran the</a> <a href=\"http://theuspatriot.com/2014/06/04/breaking-obamas-face-likely-to-be-put-on-new-dollar-bill/\"><em>Weekly World News</em> story</a> as fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found the version of the story currently in circulation on <a href=\"http://stuppid.com/obama-one-dollar-bill/\">blogs going back to 2014</a>, with the same faux dollar illustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States Mint did strike a pair of bronze medals <a href=\"https://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index1848.html?action=press_release&amp;id=1848\">commemorating Obama&rsquo;s two terms in office</a>.
