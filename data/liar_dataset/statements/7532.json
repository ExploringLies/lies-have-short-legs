We checked in with <a href=\"https://www.aaafoundation.org/2012-traffic-safety-culture-index\">AAA</a>, which supports Holder&rsquo;s bill.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe found interesting research that resemble Holder&rsquo;s claim on these sites.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\t\tAt least <a href=\"http://www.textinganddrivingsafety.com/texting-and-driving-stats/\">23 percent </a>of all crashes involved cell phones in 2011.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\t\tTexting while driving makes a driver <a href=\"http://www.distraction.gov/content/get-the-facts/facts-and-statistics.html\">23 times more likely to crash</a>.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t\t\tAbout <a href=\"https://www.aaafoundation.org/2012-traffic-safety-culture-index\">26.2 percent </a>of motorists admitted typing or sending an email while driving in the past month.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut nowhere did we find an estimate as high as Holder&rsquo;s for the percentage of crashes caused by texting while driving.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tReached by phone, Holder acknowledged he messed up his numbers. He said he meant to say &quot;distracted driving&quot; instead of &quot;texting while driving,&quot; but he got, well, distracted in front of the committee considering his bill.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;I was not looking at my notes because I was trying to show my passion about it,&quot; Holder said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhat else constitutes distracted driving? (As if you don&rsquo;t know.) There&rsquo;s talking on the phone and to other passengers, putting on makeup, using a GPS and adjusting music, among other driving vices.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTexting is by far the worst because it demands a driver&rsquo;s visual, manual and cognitive attention, according to the <a href=\"http://www.distraction.gov/content/get-the-facts/facts-and-statistics.html\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe were curious what Florida figures were available for crashes caused by texting while driving. Texting caused nearly .1 percent of more than 256,000 crashes in 2012, according to preliminary data collected by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Crashes that resulted from distractions by any electronic communication device comprised 1.79 percent of crashes, or 4,586, in 2012, according to the same state data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe real number is likely higher. A <a href=\"http://thefloridachannel.org/video/31313-house-civil-justice-subcommittee/\">committee analysis </a>of HB 13 makes an important point about gathering data in Florida: It&rsquo;s incomplete. For a crash report to identify texting as the cause of an accident means a motorist has to admit that to an officer. And because it is not an enforceable offense, there is no consistent way for law enforcement officers to enter it into their reports.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHolder&rsquo;s statistic that 25 percent of all crashes are the result of texting at the wheel missed the mark. It would have been more accurate had he said &quot;distracted driving&quot; or &quot;using cell phones.&quot; There&rsquo;s a grain of truth in that texting is one of the ways a driver can be distracted.
