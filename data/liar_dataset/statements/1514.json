That's just plain wrong -- wrong for businesses, our economy, and everyday Floridians.\"<br />&nbsp;<br />The charge refers to comments McCollum has made over the years, but the Sink campaign also cited some of McCollum's votes while in Congress from 1981 to 2001.<br />&nbsp;<br />First, his words.<br /><br />Sink's Facebook statement refers to a Feb. 15, 2010, article from the News Service of Florida about comments from three candidates for governor&nbsp; -- Sink, McCollum and Republican Paula Dockery -- at a Tallahassee forum sponsored by the National Federation of Independent Business and Florida TaxWatch.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here is what the article said about McCollum's comments on tax cuts:<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>While Democrat Alex Sink and Republican Paula Dockery both promoted the idea of offering tax breaks to spur job-creation, Republican Bill McCollum said the approach is not a panacea.<br />&nbsp;<br />\"Targeted tax credits, in my experience in Washington, were minimally effective,\" said McCollum, a former 10-term Congressman from the Orlando-area. \"They can be in the short run, but in the long run they are not effective,\" he added. \"But I think all of us wish there were a simple solution to the re-creation of jobs in Florida.\"</em><br />&nbsp;<br />The article also stated that all three candidates \"vowed to steer clear from tax increases\" and \"supported delaying a sharp increase in the state's unemployment compensation tax that businesses now face paying on April 1.\"<br />&nbsp;<br />Sink's campaign also cited a Nov. 5, 2000, <em>South Florida Sun-Sentinel</em> article in which McCollum, then a U.S. Senate candidate, discussed tax cuts.<br />&nbsp;<br />The article said that McCollum's \"stump speeches Saturday repeated his themes of 'better government, not bigger government.' And he continued his attack on [Democrat Bill] Nelson for his support of $500 billion in targeted cuts, rather than the $1.3 trillion in across-the-board cuts favored by Bush.<br />&nbsp;<br />\"'Targeted tax cuts are just a liberal's fancy way of saying they want government to decide who gets the money,' McCollum told a handful of supporters at a Punta Gorda retirement community.\"<br />&nbsp;<br />Those passages indicate that McCollum's position on tax cuts has followed party lines; he was opposed to the Democrat's \"targeted cuts,\" but he appears to have supported an across-the-board tax cut favored by Republicans.<br /><br />To rebut the Sink claim, McCollum's campaign provided us with a few articles quoting him in favor of tax cuts. A Feb. 15, 2010, <em>Newsmax </em>article quotes McCollum saying, \"We need to reduce the capital gains tax\" and that he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate. In that article, he criticized Obama's proposal for a tax credit for businesses that hire new workers.<br />&nbsp;<br />\"I never thought targeted tax credits were very effective,\" McCollum said.<br />&nbsp;<br />In a transcript of a McCollum speech printed in the <em>Florida Times-Union</em> on July 31, 2000, McCollum said that Congress could \"not only cut taxes, but restructure the tax code.\"<br /><br />To get a more complete picture of McCollum's position, we also looked at his votes on various tax cuts.<br /><br />His record shows that, contrary to Sink's claim, he voted for tax cuts several times. Even the Florida Democratic Party has noted that; it issued a news release Dec. 29, 2009, stating that McCollum has repeatedly voted in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sink's campaign provided two examples of when McCollum voted against tax cuts in the 1990s, but they were party-line votes that indicate he was voting with other Republicans in opposition to a Democratic proposal. By contrast, McCollum's campaign cited many other votes that McCollum took in favor of tax cuts, including votes to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and the estate tax.<br /><br />So based on the news articles and our examination of McCollum's voting record, it's clear that he has often supported tax cuts -- particularly Republican proposals.<br /><br />So Sink is cherry-picking here. Although McCollum did say he was opposed to \"targeted\" (read: Democratic) tax cuts, he has spoken and voted in favor of them many other times, particularly the across-the-board proposals favored by Republicans.
