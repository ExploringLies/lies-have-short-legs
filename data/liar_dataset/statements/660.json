So collectively we have been borrowing from foreign countries to pay our bills.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the important indicators of countries that  lend us this money is the list of foreign countries holding U.S. Treasury securities.\n</p>\n<p>\n The U.S. government issues Treasury securities to finance its debt. In laymen's terms, these are simply IOUs that guarantee repayment with interest. Many U.S. citizens buy them, often in the form of U.S. bonds, but so do many foreign countries, who see them as a safe, stable investment.\n</p>\n<p>\n The No. 1 holder of U.S. Treasury securities among foreign countries isn't China. It's actually Japan. China is No. 2, the United Kingdom is No. 3, and a group of oil-producing countries (which includes Saudi Arabia) is No. 4.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bonds the government sells are not program-specific, so there is no direct relationship between the holder of bonds and any particular expense of the U.S. government. Warner could have easily said that Japan or the United Kingdom is lending us money to pay for oil, and that would have been just as true as what he did say.\n</p>\n<p>\n Economists also caution against linking our country's foreign debt to our dependency on foreign-produced oil.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I don't think that there is any link between oil prices causing the low saving of American households or the government's budget deficits. Both preceded the rise in oil prices,\" said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the Brookings Institution whom we interviewed earlier this year. \"Some people will prefer a solution that increases energy supply and others will argue that it is time to reduce demand. I don't think the lack of saving will play much of a role.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Finally, let's look at the last part of Warner's statement, that we're buying oil \"from countries that don't like us.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Objectively speaking, we're not sure how they feel about us, but we do know who Americans think are our enemies. A Gallup Poll earlier this year found that Americans believe the following countries are our greatest enemies:\n</p>\n<p>\n Iran - 25 percent; Iraq - 22 percent; China - 14 percent; North Korea/Korea - 9 percent; United States itself - 3 percent; Afghanistan - 3 percent; Pakistan - 2 percent; Russia - 2 percent; Saudi Arabia - 1 percent; Venezuela - 1 percent; Other - 6 percent.\n</p>\n<p>\n The country we buy the most oil from is Canada, according to the Energy Information Administration. No. 2 is Mexico, followed by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, Iraq and Russia. So Americans consider only about four of these nine countries their enemies, for what that's worth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Warner is right in some of the larger themes he's expressing. The United States does borrow more than it saves, and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy needs. But the two phenomena aren't causally related. And you could just as easily say that we're borrowing from a number of other countries to pay for oil. For these reasons, we find his statement Half True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:05.303408", "ruling_date": "2008-08-26T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Not just China -- other countries, too", "ruling_headline_slug": "not-just-china-other-countries-too", "ruling_link_text": "Not just China -- other countries, too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n Democratic National Convention,\n <a href=\"http://www.demconvention.com/mark-warner/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Keynote speech of Senate candidate Mark Warner\n </a>\n , Aug. 26, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Department of Treasury,\n <a href=\"http://www.treas.gov/tic/mfh.txt\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Major foreign holders of Treasury securities\n </a>\n , April 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Commerce Department,\n <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/International/Index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n  International balance of payments\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/11/06/business/20071107_WINNERSLOSERS_GRAPHIC.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  A Map of the Oil World,\n </a>\n Nov. 6, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute\n</p>\n<p>\n Gallup Poll,\n <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/105835/North-Korea-Drops-Top-Three  -US-Enemies.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\n  North Korea Drops Out of Top Three U.S.   'Enemies'\n </a>\n , March 28, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Energy Information Administration,\n <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00  _im0_mbblpd_a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n  U.S. Imports by Country of Origin\n </a>\n , 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Mark", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 61, "last_name": "Warner", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "mark-warner", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-markwarner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/61/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The U.S. energy policy is to \"borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us.\"</p>", "statement_context": "Denver", "statement_date": "2008-08-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
