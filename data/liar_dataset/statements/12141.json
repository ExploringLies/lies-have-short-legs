But we did look into the source behind his forecast. Blunt spokesman Brian Hart pointed us to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mpua.org/_lib/files/Midwestern_GHG_Impacts_032609_Clean_5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">this study</a>&nbsp;on behalf of a group of Midwest utilities and regulators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We found two significant issues.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>First, the study says Missouri electricity bills could possibly double by 2030, not 2020.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Second, the study was conducted in 2009, but Obama and the EPA didn&rsquo;t actually propose the Clean Power Plan until 2015. The methodologies used to conduct the study aren&rsquo;t consistent with Obama&rsquo;s current environmental proposal.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But we did&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/powerplants/cleanplan/\" target=\"_blank\">find a study from the U.S. Environmental Information Administration</a>&nbsp;that specifically breaks down how the Clean Power Plan will affect electrical utilities.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>That agency predicts electricity prices&nbsp;will rise slightly in the early 2020s. Prices will differ across the country, but the highest rise in prices is predicted to be 7 percent.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Blunt said the Obama administration&rsquo;s regulations have caused thousands of workers in the coal industry to lose their jobs. While the decline in coal industry employment is real, the role of administration policy is less certain.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Experts note that competition from abundant, cheap natural gas has reduced the demand for coal more than any other factor. With less demand, the need for workers falls. While the administration has encouraged movement away from coal for environmental reasons, market forces in the energy sector have been the dominant driver.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>While it is impossible to know how utility costs will rise or fall in the future, the study on which Blunt based his claims was conducted before the Clean Power Plan was enacted.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Blunt&rsquo;s claim overemphasizes the role of White House policy.&nbsp;We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-28T22:56:15.026837", "ruling_date": "2016-03-16T22:45:30", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
