By that measurement, the national average was about <a href=\"http://eddataexpress.ed.gov/data-element-explorer.cfm/tab/data/deid/4537/\">81 percent </a>in 2012-13. (Florida is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/1211/be-no-1-high-school-graduation-rates/\">below</a> that national average.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for spending, Bush&rsquo;s spokeswoman pointed to a 2013 Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/oecd-education-report_n_3496875.html\">article</a> about a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that compared per-pupil spending among 34 advanced industrialized nations.
