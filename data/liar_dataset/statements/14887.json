Orrin Hatch and said it came from basketball star Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dec. 10 <a href=\"https://proconservativenews.com/shaquille-oneal-says-trump-is-possibly-the-best-president-of-the-president-of-all-times-ever-he-is-not-afraid-to/\">headline</a> includes an awkwardly worded alleged quote by the basketball star: &quot;Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal says: &lsquo;Trump is possibly the best president of the president of all times ever, he is not afraid to...&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that O&rsquo;Neal made that statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story started with a quote by Hatch that Trump had &quot;been one of the best presidents&quot; he ever served under.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was followed by a supposed quote by O&rsquo;Neal:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t pay much attention to his tweets. I&rsquo;ll say this for you. He&rsquo;s been one of the best presidents I&rsquo;ve served under. And the reasoning is, he&rsquo;s not afraid to make decisions. He&rsquo;s not afraid to take on the -- the big mouths around here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/11/29/orrin-hatch-trump-one-best-presidents-ive-served/\">video of Hatch </a>showed that he was the one who made that statement after he was asked about Trump&rsquo;s tweets in November. (Hatch, a Utah Republican, announced Jan. 2 that he will not seek re-election.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find real examples of O&rsquo;Neal talking about Trump optimistically. Before the 2016 election, O&rsquo;Neal referred to Trump as his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6gWTgyuibk\">friend</a> but suggested he tweak his language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think if he could reword some of the things he says and put it in business form, it would really make sense,&quot; O&rsquo;Neal said, according to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6gWTgyuibk\">video </a>posted in 2015. &quot;Donald is like a straight-up guy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2016 after Trump won, O&rsquo;Neal said on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBAonTNT/status/796886683190837248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">TNT</a> that &quot;everyone was in shock&quot; about the outcome but that he hoped Trump would bring people together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s kind of hard to believe that a guy with no political experience is the president of the United States,&quot; O&rsquo;Neal said, calling for the public to give Trump a chance to do his job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sent a message to Pro Conservative News on Facebook and did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline stated that O&rsquo;Neal said Trump &quot;is possibly the best president.&quot; This fake news story appeared to take a quote from Hatch and attribute it to O&rsquo;Neal. It was Hatch who said of Trump &quot;he&rsquo;s been one of the best presidents I&rsquo;ve served under.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim&nbsp;Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-03T14:10:59.681278", "ruling_date": "2018-01-03T14:26:50", "ruling_headline": "No, Shaq didn't declare Trump possibly the best president", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-shaq-didnt-declare-trump-best-president", "ruling_link_text": "See Orrin Hatch's statement", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Pro Conservative News, <a href=\"https://proconservativenews.com/shaquille-oneal-says-trump-is-possibly-the-best-president-of-the-president-of-all-times-ever-he-is-not-afraid-to/\">&quot;Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal Says: &lsquo;Trump is possibly the best president of the president of all times ever, he is not afraid to...,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Dec. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Salt Lake Tribune</em>, <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/12/20/you-are-one-heck-of-a-leader-after-tax-vote-sen-orrin-hatch-says-trump-may-become-the-best-president-ever/\">&quot;&lsquo;You are one heckuva leader&rsquo; After tax vote, Sen.
