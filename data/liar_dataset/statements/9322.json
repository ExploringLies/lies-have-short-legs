John Kitzhaber</a>, running for an unprecedented fourth term and taking a lot of flak for the collapse of the <a href=\"https://www.coveroregon.com/\">Cover Oregon</a> website, has been trying to shine a light on his accomplishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of them struck a meat-and-potatoes campaign theme: jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent campaign email, the Democratic governor claimed: &quot;Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected.&quot; He repeated the claim to Harry Esteve, a reporter for The Oregonian, <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/05/gov_john_kitzhaber_once_seen_a.html\">for a recent story</a>, and that also got a lot of readers wondering about the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the number is true, it would be great news in a state where the recession hit harder and lingered longer. We decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard way for economists -- and PolitiFact -- to analyze such statements is to use data from the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the federal government&rsquo;s source for employment data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two most commonly cited sources of bureau data are a survey of households and a survey of employer payrolls. The first sample is smaller but more detailed. But for measuring raw numbers of jobs, payroll data is preferred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within that data, &quot;non-farm jobs,&quot; tallied monthly, are the most commonly used. Nick Beleiciks, an employment economist with the <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/EMPLOY/pages/index.aspx\">Oregon Department of Employment</a>, said that&rsquo;s because every state keeps those figures, making them comparable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make comparisons over time, economists prefer &quot;seasonally adjusted&quot; numbers to smooth out cyclical differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we used <a href=\"http://beta.bls.gov/maps/cew/us\">the bureau&rsquo;s interactive website</a> to find the seasonally adjusted figures for non-farm jobs in Oregon when Kitzhaber was last elected, in November 2010, and for March 2014, when the email went out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>November 2010</strong>: 1,609,600</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>March 2014</strong>: 1,708,900</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increase</strong>: 99,300</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Kitzhaber&rsquo;s claim is very close to accurate. It&rsquo;s mirrored in the unemployment rate, according to bureau data, which fell from 10.4 percent in November 2010 to 6.9 percent this past March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Job growth in Oregon even exceeded the national rate during that time, 6.1 percent to 5.8 percent, according to BLS figures. In March, Oregon&rsquo;s seasonally adjusted monthly job gain of 8,900 jobs was the largest since November 2005, when 9,300 jobs were added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, two points detract from the accuracy of Kitzhaber&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the claim is ever so slightly cherry-picked. He could have started the clock the month he was sworn in -- January 2011. That time frame would have produced an increase of 94,000 jobs. Christian Gaston, a Kitzhaber campaign spokesman, agreed that the start time should have been pegged to the start of Kitzhaber&rsquo;s latest term as governor, not the final two months of Ted Kulongoski&rsquo;s second term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, while Kitzhaber did not personally claim credit for creating 100,000 jobs, he did cite the statistic in an email that began, &quot;Four years ago, you stood with me as together we promised Oregon that we could make critical progress on education, healthcare, and rebuilding our economy, even in the face of a significant partisan divide.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, he&rsquo;s aiming to make sure he and his administration get some credit for the job growth. But we should make clear that governors are not all-powerful in shaping their state&rsquo;s economy. Their policies on taxes, spending and economic development can make a difference, but state economies are also tied to the national and global economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kitzhaber&rsquo;s email said, &quot;Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected.&quot; He&rsquo;s essentially correct on the numbers. Technically, it&rsquo;s 99,300 &ndash; though it&rsquo;s important to note that it would have been 94,000 if he had counted from the time he was sworn in and affecting policy. It&rsquo;s also important to note that governors have a modest influence on their state&rsquo;s economy. We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/05/does_oregon_have_100000_more_j.html#incart_river_default\">To comment on this story, go to OregonLive/politics.com</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-13T17:32:37.469361", "ruling_date": "2014-05-13T14:32:17", "ruling_headline": "Does Oregon have 100,000 more jobs today than it did when John Kitzhaber was elected?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-oregon-have-100000-more-jobs-today-it-did-whe", "ruling_link_text": "A claim that (mostly) gets the job done", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Telephone interview, Nick Beleiciks, employment economist, Oregon Employment Department, May 12, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Beleiciks, May 12, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics interactive website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails from Christian Gaston, Kitzhaber campaign spokesman, May 12/13, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oregon Employment Department jobs report, April/May 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Tara Sinclair, economist, George Washington University, May 13, 2014.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Governor of Oregon", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "John ", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 691, "last_name": "Kitzhaber", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-kitzhaber", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/kitzhaber41.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/691/", "total_count": 14, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.johnkitzhaber.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an email to supporters", "statement_date": "2014-05-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
