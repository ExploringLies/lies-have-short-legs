But those headline-grabbing pledges have been kept:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Reed pushed a pension reform through City Council to help Atlanta pay off a $1.5 billion liability and save taxpayers $25 million a year.</li>\r\n\t<li>Reed used $4.3 million of that freed up cash to re-open 22 recreation centers shuttered in 2008 due to budget constraints.</li>\r\n\t<li>The city millage rate &ndash; approved by Council based on the mayor&rsquo;s recommendation &ndash; has fallen during Reed&rsquo;s tenure, from $10.24 for every thousand dollars of assessed value to $9.75.</li>\r\n\t<li>Atlanta&rsquo;s police force reached 2,000 officers in October 2013, with Reed credited for the achievement by pushing for new positions and pay raises.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The mayor does give credit to the council for getting a lot of his ideas done and passed,&quot; said Reed spokeswoman Anne Torres. &quot;He realized in order to get the city in the right direction, and fulfill his promises, he really had to get Atlanta on proper financial footing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could nitpick since Atlanta had just 1,971 officers on the force this week, as it struggles with the same churn other local law enforcement agencies face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But PolitiFact Georgia wants to be more skeptical than cynical. So we dug into press coverage during Reed&rsquo;s 2009 campaign and found smaller promises that need some explaining:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Cut the amount the city spends on outside attorneys</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>City records show Atlanta spent $12.8 million for outside counsel in the fiscal year 2014, which ended in June. That&rsquo;s about 9 percent less than 2009&rsquo;s $14 million bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Re-open Fire Station 7 in West End</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The fire station remains closed. But a 2013 press release announced Reed&rsquo;s plans to renovate the city&rsquo;s oldest station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city has spent $2.5 million so far on design work for the station, built in 1910. Torres said the fire department is preparing bids for the full renovation, expected to take a year once the city selects a contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Reduce employee overtime</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Employee overtime cost the city $12 million in OT in 2014, an 88 percent increase from overtime bill in 2009, the last year before Reed took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Torres notes, though, that 2009 was a year of furloughs and layoffs because of the city&rsquo;s financial woes. Reed&rsquo;s promise was based on the 2008 tab, of nearly $18 million, she said. Looking at it that way, Reed cut OT by 39 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Cut the city&rsquo;s IT budget</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The city budget shows a 13 percent increase in IT spending: $25,242,270 in 2009 and 28,544,187 for the fiscal year that began July 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hans Utz, the city&rsquo;s deputy chief operating officer, said Atlanta had long put individual departments&rsquo; IT costs in those department budgets &ndash; not the overall information technology budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That artificially inflated department budgets, Utz said. Starting in 2013, the city began shifting all IT costs to that department and saving by buying in bulk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The move increased the IT budget by $3.3 million but decreased other department budgets by $5.6 million &ndash; a $2.3 million net reduction, budget records show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, would accepting those explanations mean giving Reed too much leeway to keep his promises?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not necessarily. Politicians tend to keep promises more than you might think, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blame &ndash; sigh &ndash; the media for implying candidates don&rsquo;t at least try, according to Thomas Patterson&rsquo;s 1993 book, &quot;Out of Order,&quot; Swint said. It cites four studies of seven presidential campaigns and found once elected, presidents keep the promises they made as candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In general, politicians try to keep their promises because it&rsquo;s in their best interest to do so,&quot; Swint said. &quot;&quot;From their point of view, they can&rsquo;t wave a magic wand and make things happen. There is a process, and that can seem like foot-dragging to critics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, we concede, to cynics. So while there is a window for promises we may not know Reed made when he ran for office, the pledges big and small appear at least in process, if not done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Reed&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-14T14:47:41.387005", "ruling_date": "2014-08-15T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cynics beware: Promises appear on track", "ruling_headline_slug": "cynics-beware-promises-appear-track", "ruling_link_text": "Pledges in process or done", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Kasim Reed <a href=\"http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=672&amp;recordid=2936\"><strong>press release</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/atlanta-council-unanimously-approves-pension-overh/nQwsY/\"><strong>Atlanta council unanimously approves pension overhaul</strong></a>,&quot; June 30, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/public-pension-crisis-threatens-your-wallet/nQrzS/\"><strong>Public pension crisis threatens your wallet</strong></a>,&quot; March 27, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/opinion/26friedman.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;_r=0\"><strong>Cut Here.
