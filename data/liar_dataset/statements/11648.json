De Le&oacute;n, D-Los Angeles, spoke about California&rsquo;s role as a leader in the fight against climate change to members of Parliament in the United Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told them California has &quot;robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation<strong>, </strong>all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe,&quot; according to a November <a href=\"http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-11-10-pro-tem-highlights-california%E2%80%99s-climate-leadership-uk\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>press release</u></a> from the senator&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s employment picture has certainly improved from the Great Recession, when it lost <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>more than a million jobs</u></a> from 2007 to 2009. Economists credit a rebound in housing and construction jobs plus strong tech sector growth for the state&rsquo;s healthier employment figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, we wondered, is the state seeing job growth that truly &quot;outpaces the rest of the nation,&quot; as the senator claimed? Or did his statement exaggerate the state&rsquo;s good job news?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check limited to this question. We did not evaluate the additional question of how the state&rsquo;s clean energy rules have affected California&rsquo;s job growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/5774166/Skyscraper_construction_A_Primary_cropped.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/5774166/Skyscraper_construction_A_Primary_cropped.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:800px\" /></a></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists we spoke with said De Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s statement, on its face, is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They said they took his statement to mean California&rsquo;s job growth rate was higher than the country&rsquo;s overall job growth rate. And it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, California added jobs at a 3 percent clip compared with the previous year. That was more than a percentage point higher than the country&rsquo;s overall rate of 1.9 percent during the same period, according to data from Chapman University&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.chapman.edu/research-and-institutions/anderson-center/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Center for Economic Research</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Overall, the statement is accurate,&quot; said Professor Esmael Adibi, the center&rsquo;s director. &quot;We are outperforming the U.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s not a new trend, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The state has actually outperformed the country as a whole for 44 consecutive months, which amounts to almost four years,&quot; Reaser said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, there&rsquo;s more to the nation&rsquo;s job picture. Fourteen other states in 2014 had a higher job growth rate than the country overall, according to data provided by the economists. California&rsquo;s accomplishment was hardly unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another interpretation of De Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s claim is that California&rsquo;s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states in &quot;the rest of the nation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked to clarify the senator&rsquo;s statement, De Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s office pointed to recent <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-california-jobs-20150918-story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news articles</u></a> that describe California adding more total jobs than any other state, and adding jobs at a faster pace than the nation overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the phrase &quot;rest of the nation&quot; is open to different readings, Abibi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is he talking about the U.S. as a whole or is he talking about Texas or North Dakota or Michigan?&quot; the professor asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s significant because five other states had a faster job growth rate than California&rsquo;s 3 percent last year. They were North Dakota at 3.8 percent; Nevada at 3.5 percent; Colorado at 3.3 percent; Florida at 3.2 percent and Texas with 3.1 percent, according to state and federal data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/5774555/image003 2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/5774555/image003%202.jpg\" style=\"width:100%px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Senator Kevin&nbsp;De Le&oacute;n addresses&nbsp;members of the U.K. Parliament&nbsp;in London. Photo courtesy De&nbsp;Le&oacute;n&#39;s office.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Senator Kevin de Le&oacute;n said earlier this month that California has &quot;robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We limited our fact check to whether California has grown jobs faster than &quot;the rest of the nation.&quot; We did not evaluate the impact the state&rsquo;s clean energy policies have had on job growth, a question raised by the second part of De Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s statement. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists we spoke with agree that California&rsquo;s job growth rate has been higher than the nation&rsquo;s overall average &mdash; for several years. Last year, the state&rsquo;s job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the country&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state that&rsquo;s added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there is another way to read the senator&rsquo;s statement. One could assume the senator meant California&rsquo;s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states. Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of &quot;the rest of the nation,&quot; and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">more</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-12-03T16:45:50.452092", "ruling_date": "2015-12-07T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Senator claims California grows jobs faster than \"rest of the nation\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "senator-claims-california-grows-jobs-faster-rest-n", "ruling_link_text": "Jobs claim needs a clarification", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Phone interview with Lynn Reaser, chief economist, Point Loma Nazarene University, Nov.&nbsp;30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with&nbsp;Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman University&rsquo;s <u><a href=\"http://www.chapman.edu/research-and-institutions/anderson-center/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Center for Economic Research</a>, Nov.&nbsp;30, 2015</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Los Angeles Times, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-california-jobs-20150918-story.html\">&quot;</a></u><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-california-jobs-20150918-story.html\">California posts solid jobs growth; unemployment rate falls to 6.1%,&quot;</a>&nbsp;Sept.&nbsp;18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Southern California Public Radio, <a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/11/20/55777/what-slowdown-california-job-growth-continues-outp/\">&quot;</a><a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/11/20/55777/what-slowdown-california-job-growth-continues-outp/\">What slowdown?
