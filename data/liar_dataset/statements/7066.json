Based on votes she cast, three major rankings put Baldwin among a group of House members considered the most liberal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;ve already examined the proposed tax increase cited in the Republican committee&rsquo;s ad. It was part of a 2012 federal budget proposal made by the <a href=\"http://cpc.grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=70&amp;sectiontree=5,70&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=et&amp;utm_content=www.cpc.grijalva.house.gov&amp;utm_campaign=1821901_285487_Tommy%20Thompson%20for%20Senate\">Congressional Progressive Caucus</a>, which consists of U.S. Sen.

We rated the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/05/tommy-thompson/budget-backed-democrat-tammy-baldwin-spent-trillio/\">False</a> because the caucus budget would have spent less over 10 years than Obama&rsquo;s budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut we pointed out that, according to experts, total tax collections under the caucus plan would have been some $5 trillion higher than under the&nbsp;Obama budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn an April 2011 vote, the caucus budget <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h274\">failed</a> in the House, 347-77.
