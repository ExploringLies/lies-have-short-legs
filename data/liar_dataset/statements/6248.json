A fired former employee of Adelson&rsquo;s filed a lawsuit which <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2012/06/28/ex_sands_exec_alleges_prostitution_in_macau_sites/\">alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties</a> his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/07/09/sheldon-adelson-fires-back-against-prostitution-allegations/\">Adelson vigorously denies those allegations</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat does any of that have to do with Rep. Jim Renacci?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven though Federal Election Commission records show that Adelson hasn&rsquo;t ever donated to Renacci, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tried to use the casino owner&rsquo;s legal woes against the Medina County congressman with a provocatively titled press release: &quot;Congressman Renacci&rsquo;s Re-election Funded by Chinese Prostitution Money?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci&rsquo;s Republican majority,&quot; the DCCC claimed in a news release on July 2, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What will Congressman Jim Renacci do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?&quot; it continued, urging Renacci to &quot;reject the support of these groups funded by money from a Chinese prostitution strategy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs a result of redistricting, Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, Ohio, is pitted against Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat. That makes him a target for the DCCC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn&rsquo;t spent anything so far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle. The NRCC regularly sends out news releases that attack Sutton, Renacci&rsquo;s November election rival who is from Copley Township near Akron.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Renacci campaign spokesman James Slepian about the DCCC&rsquo;s claim that the congressman&rsquo;s re-election might somehow be funded by Chinese prostitution money, Slepian replied that there is &quot;no money from Chinese prostitutes, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy in our campaign coffers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The DCCC&#39;s Chinese prostitution fantasy demonstrates that they are now fully immersed in the gutter and will literally say anything to avoid talking about Betty Sutton&#39;s lockstep support for the failed Obama economic agenda,&quot; Slepian said. &quot;This campaign needs to be about the economy and voting records, not fairy tales about Chinese hookers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe allegations that Adelson signed off on prostitution at his properties in Macau were raised last month during a lawsuit filed by former Sands executive Steven Jacobs, who was fired from overseeing those properties in July 2010. Associated Press reported that Jacobs&rsquo; lawsuit accuses Adelson of breach of contract and pushing him into illegal activity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA court filing from Jacobs says he tried to rid the casino floor of &quot;loan sharks and prostitution&quot; while he worked there, which upset senior executives who informed him that &quot;the prior prostitution strategy had been personally approved by Adelson.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA spokesman for the Adelson&rsquo;s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always &quot;maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson&rsquo;s character.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, &nbsp;Adelson said there&rsquo;s not a &quot;shred of evidence&quot; to back his former employee&rsquo;s charges, and &quot;says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) <a href=\"http://www.adelsoncliniclasvegas.com/\">have given millions of dollars to set up clinics</a> around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the &hellip; claims even more preposterous.&quot; &nbsp;Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson&rsquo;s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC&rsquo;s claim that &quot;foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci&rsquo;s Republican majority?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t think so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe root of the allegation stems from a fired employee&rsquo;s claim that Adelson allowed prostitution to be present in a casino in Macau. Based on that, the DCCC claims that Adelson, one of the wealthiest people in America, made political contributions with cash from prostitution revenues. And then the claim invokes Renacci&rsquo;s name as part of the Republican majority that this tainted money is supposedly supporting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRenacci hasn&rsquo;t accepted money from Adelson and doesn&rsquo;t control contributions to the GOP groups that support him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim that Adelson&rsquo;s donations to these other groups amount to &quot;Chinese prostitution money&quot; is dubious enough that inserting the word &quot;allegedly&quot; can&rsquo;t save it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, the DCCC statement rates Pants on Fire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-11T18:43:31.341634", "ruling_date": "2012-07-12T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "DCCC claims money from Chinese prostitution supports Jim Renacci's GOP majority", "ruling_headline_slug": "dccc-claims-money-chinese-prostitution-supports-ji", "ruling_link_text": "'Allegedly' ridiculous", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSearch of Federal Election Commission records conducted on Political MoneyLine, July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee press release titled &nbsp;&quot;Congressman Renacci&rsquo;s Re-election Funded by Chinese Prostitution Money?&quot; July 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2012/06/28/ex_sands_exec_alleges_prostitution_in_macau_sites/\">Ex-Sands exec alleges prostitution in Macau sites</a>, June 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75173.html\">Newt&rsquo;s billionaire, Sheldon Adelson, gives $5M to establishment</a>, April 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tForbes, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/07/09/sheldon-adelson-fires-back-against-prostitution-allegations/\">Sheldon Adelson fires back against prostitution allegations,</a> July 9, 2012&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "", "id": 652, "last_name": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "democratic-congressional-campaign-committee", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mugs_mug-dnc_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/652/", "total_count": 38, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.dccc.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci&rsquo;s Republican majority.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news release", "statement_date": "2012-07-02", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 165, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/165/", "subject": "Negative Campaigning", "subject_slug": "campaign-advertising", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "U.S. representative ", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Jim", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 606, "last_name": "Renacci", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "jim-renacci", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-renacci_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/606/", "total_count": 19, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://jimrenacci.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
