We opened that stock exchange the next day; people were shocked. A great group of people &mdash; the head of the New York Stock Exchange is just a fantastic guy &mdash; Dick (Grasso). And he opened it up.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that day, Trump kept his promise to <a href=\"https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-murphysboro-il-october-27-2018\">hold a rally</a> in Murphysboro, Ill. He repeated the anecdote in that address:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;With what happened early today, that horrible, horrible attack in Pittsburgh, I was saying maybe I should cancel both this and that (the speech in Indianapolis). And then I said to myself, I remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy. He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 11. And the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day. He said &mdash; and what they had to do to open it, you wouldn&#39;t believe. We won&#39;t even talk to you about it, but he got that exchange open. We can&#39;t make these sick, demented, evil people important.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what really happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Stock Exchange didn&rsquo;t open on the morning of the attacks, which hit the World Trade Center a few blocks away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exchange building wasn&#39;t directly damaged, the Associated Press reported at the time, but &quot;the surrounding neighborhood was littered with debris.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stock exchange <a href=\"https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL31617.pdf\">didn&rsquo;t open again</a> until Sept. 17, 2001. Even a week after the attacks, conditions were hardly normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point &quot;rescue workers continued to search for survivors amid smoldering rubble,&quot; the AP reported, and &quot;the smell of smoke still (hung) in the air &mdash; even permeating the NYSE trading floor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump does accurately remember Grasso&rsquo;s involvement. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he rang the opening bell on Sept. 17, Grasso said, &quot;Today, America goes back to business. We do it as a signal to those criminals who inflicted this heinous crime on America and all Americans, they have lost.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the New York Times, &quot;traders took subways instead of limousines, trudged on foot from the Staten Island Ferry, and began lining up at 7:30 outside the exchange to have their bags searched and ID tags checked.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said he didn&#39;t cancel a political rally because after the 9/11 attacks, &quot;the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day.&quot; It wasn&rsquo;t; the exchange didn&rsquo;t open until a week later, on Sept. 17.
