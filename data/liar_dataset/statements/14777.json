Thirty-two of the defendants were from the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/national-health-care-fraud-takedown-results-charges-against-over-412-individuals-responsible\">Eastern District of Michigan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh Media News cited some accurate details in the case, including that the FBI raided medical offices in Detroit&rsquo;s historic <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/07/12/seven-indicted-medicare-fraud/103640140/\">Fisher building</a> and named one of the actual Michigan defendants: <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/981316/download\">Mashiyat Rashid</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prosecutors allege that Rashid ran a conspiracy starting in 2008 that involved six other defendants and various companies in which they recruited homeless people as patients and sent phony bills to Medicare, according to <em><a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/10/20/alleged-fraudster-jailed-scheme/106836056/\">The Detroit News</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Detroit News</em> described Rashid as a &quot;Muslim businessman, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh and is a U.S. citizen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Fresh Media News wrote without evidence that the 412 suspects were Muslims, nothing in the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/documents-and-resources-july-13-2017-national-health-care-fraud-takedown-press-conference\">federal documents</a> we reviewed, including Sessions&rsquo; remarks, mentioned the religion of the defendant.
