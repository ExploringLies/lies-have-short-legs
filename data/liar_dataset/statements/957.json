He justified his agenda partly by saying American students are slipping compared to counterparts around the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;We've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us,&quot; Obama said in the March 10 speech to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. &quot;In eighth grade math, we've fallen to ninth place.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n Since Obama brought up math, we decided to check his. Turns out we had to pull out the red pen.\n</p>\n<p>\n We asked the White House to defend Obama's claim, and received no response. His claim that eighth grade math students&nbsp;in the United States are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since 1995 by research institutions and government agencies worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n The\n <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_1.asp\" target=\"_blank\">\n  most recent study\n </a>\n , published in 2007, did indeed show U.S. eighth graders in ninth place behind five East Asian countries and Hungary, England and Russia.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n But it was misleading to say they had &quot;fallen&quot; to ninth place. In 1995, they\n <a href=\"http://timss.bc.edu/timss1995i/HiLightB.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  came in 28th\n </a>\n . In 1999, they\n <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/timss/results99_1.asp\" target=\"_blank\">\n  moved up to 19th\n </a>\n . In 2003, they climbed\n <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/timss/TIMSS03Tables.asp?Quest=3&amp;Figure=5\" target=\"_blank\">\n  to 15th\n </a>\n . So rather than falling, U.S. students have actually\n <em>\n  improved\n </em>\n in the past decade.\n</p>\n<p>\n We considered giving the president partial credit since American students did come in ninth. But the point of his statement was that they had &quot;fallen&quot; to that position and that mathematics performance in the United States is getting worse relative to other countries. And that's just plain False.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:49.340353", "ruling_date": "2009-03-13T15:15:04", "ruling_headline": "Eighth graders are in ninth, but showing improvement, not falling", "ruling_headline_slug": "8th-graders-are-9th-showing-improvement-not-fallin", "ruling_link_text": "The president maligns middle-schoolers unfairly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p align=\"left\">\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/us/politics/10text-obama.html?scp=1&amp;sq=obama%20hispanic%20chamber%20of%20commerce&amp;st=cse\" target=\"_blank\">\n  President Obama&rsquo;s Remarks to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce\n </a>\n , March 10, 2009, accessed March 12, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study,\n <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_1.asp\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Table 1.
