A few replica stories were posted under the same headline on other blog <a href=\"http://viraldailymedia.blogspot.com/2018/05/mitt-romney-trump-has-some-very-serious.html\">sites</a> in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook&#39;s News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Flash News story alleged that during an interview on CNN&rsquo;s Anderson Cooper 360, Romney said Trump &quot;has some very serious emotional problems.&quot; The story also quoted Romney as suggesting Trump should resign over sexual misconduct claims and expressing concern regarding the president&rsquo;s tweets about North Korea and domestic race relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched for the headline in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Romney made such a statement. Shimrit Sheetrit, director of Anderson Cooper 360, told us it has been several years since Romney was last featured as a guest on the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as it turns out, we did find that the comments attributed to Romney in the false report were all at some point made by another former presidential candidate: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dec. 13, 2017, Sanders joined the set of Anderson Cooper 360 and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ac360/status/941119424618205184\">said</a> Trump &quot;has some very serious emotional problems&quot; in reference to a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/12/politics/trump-gillibrand-feud-layers/index.html\">Twitter attack</a> Trump made against U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. During the same interview, Sanders said Trump should resign because of the multiple sexual assault allegations levied against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Flash News story also included quotes that can be properly attributed to Sanders&rsquo; statement on <em><a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/cbs_this_morning/video/ZxxBk81S8ziHMPRtDIrULkI4u7gRCK1L/bernie-sanders-on-sexual-harassment-absurd-gop-tax-bill/\">CBS This Morning</a></em> on Dec. 7, 2017. And Sanders &mdash; not Romney &mdash; has on multiple occasions accused Trump of &quot;trying to divide us up by the color of our skin,&quot; including on Nov. 12, 2017, while visiting <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-sen-bernie-sanders-on-face-the-nation-nov-12-2017/\">CBS&rsquo;s <em>Face the Nation</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the supposed Romney quote, along with several others included in the text of the story, is actually a misattribution of multiple different quotes from Sanders.
