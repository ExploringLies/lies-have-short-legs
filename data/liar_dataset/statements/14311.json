Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs, but the articles are so inaccurate, they don&rsquo;t even bother to consistently use the same fake names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bogus saga of the House minority leader&rsquo;s children is widespread and convoluted: Facebook users flagged a string of stories starting on July 6, 2017, appearing on wazanews.tk, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The posts all invoked Pelosi&rsquo;s name, but details from story to story did not agree. Essentially, the articles said two of the California Democrat&rsquo;s adult daughters had been arrested for smuggling cocaine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the details of what happened after that premise was asserted varied wildly in the following days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first the women were said to be <a href=\"http://wazanews.tk/2017/07/06/julie-nicole-pelosi-dragged-court-handcuffs/\">caught in Berkeley, Calif.</a>, with more than 200 pounds of cocaine in their Winnebago. Later stories claimed they were <a href=\"http://wazanews.tk/2017/07/07/nancy-pelosi-taken-home-dea-daughters-sold/\">apprehended at the Mexican border</a>. The yarn went on and on, across several posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gist is that the women ran a drug ring out of a pool house, and <a href=\"http://wazanews.tk/2017/07/07/pelosi-daughters-drug-arrest-gave-just-mom-arrests-coming/\">agreed to turn on their mother</a> after they were caught. Somehow Nancy Pelosi faced charges for ethical violations, breaking federal drug laws and committing treason. (It&rsquo;s never really specified how.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually Hillary Clinton was implicated, and the women were in protective custody when the <a href=\"http://wazanews.tk/2017/07/08/bodies-cabin-fire-identified-marshals-assigned-protect-drug-smuggling-pelosi-girls/\">cabin in which they were staying</a> burned down. They <a href=\"http://wazanews.tk/2017/07/08/nancy-pelosis-missing-drug-smuggling-daughters-found-alive/\">turned up alive in Buffalo, N.Y.</a>, however, so all was well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wazanews.tk is a website <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/wazanews.tk\">registered in Amsterdam</a>, but the stories appeared to originate on <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/ourlandofthefree.com\">OurLandOfTheFree.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/freedomcrossroads.us\">FreedomCrossroads.us</a> or <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/thelastlineofdefense.org\">TheLastLineOfDefense.org</a>, a site run by <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/may/31/If-youre-fooled-by-fake-news-this-man-probably-wro/\">Christopher Blair</a>.
