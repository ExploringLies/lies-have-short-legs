Scott Walker&rsquo;s administration has provided &quot;corporate welfare&quot; and that the Legislature &quot;has been sort of a rubber stamp.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris, who is the Winnebago County executive, referred to Walker&rsquo;s 2011-&rsquo;13 state budget in giving this response:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, even in the first Walker budget, Mr. Grothman pushed through tax credits for manufacturing and agriculture,&quot; Harris said. &quot;And he did it in the last day of the Joint Finance Committee, when there really wasn&#39;t time for anyone to scrutinize what was happening. And they basically passed credits that all but eliminate income tax on manufacturers and on agricultural operations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He continued:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And, you know, it&#39;s not fair to have someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income pay less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage. But that&#39;s exactly what Glenn Grothman passed, and it&#39;s phasing in gradually.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s an eye-opener.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Grothman push through credits that, over time, would enable a factory owner earning millions to pay less state income tax than a worker earning minimum wage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The credits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2011, Grothman helped lead an effort to add manufacturing and agriculture tax credits to Walker&rsquo;s state budget. The credits apply to the production income of the businesses, not to income such as royalties and investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure gave businesses that are assessed as manufacturing or agricultural for property tax purposes a dollar-for-dollar credit on income from manufacturing or agricultural production on their 2013 tax bill. The credit, which began in 2013, rises annually until reaching 7.5 percent in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Businesses organized as, for example, limited liability companies -- where an owner pays the firm&#39;s tax as personal income tax -- can reduce their state income tax rate from as much as 7.75 percent to 0.25 percent or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, come 2016, the 7.5 percent credit could eliminate a large share of a factory owner&rsquo;s tax liability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the credits will mean $359.7 million less in tax revenues for the state over its first five years, and $128.7 million a year once it is fully phased in starting in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The value &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris, who formerly practiced as a certified public accountant and a lawyer, provided figures on the state&rsquo;s income tax rates and on the 2016 tax credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figures support his claim in that the credits would wipe away all of a factory owner&rsquo;s state income&nbsp;tax liability -- on factory production income only -- for the first $2.4 million in production income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We consulted two accounting professors: the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.uww.edu/cobe/directory/profile?id=raabew&amp;dept=N211100&amp;menu=x6876\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>William Raabe</u></a>, whose specialties include state taxation; and <a href=\"http://bus.wisc.edu/faculty/stacie-laplante\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Stacie LaPlante</u></a>, chair in accounting at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Business School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They agreed that a full-time minimum-wage worker ($7.25 per hour for 2,000 hours per year) claiming the standard deduction ($9,930) and exemption ($700) would owe about $170 in state income tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also agreed that the factory owner wouldn&rsquo;t owe more than that on production income until after earning roughly $2.6 million in production income -- a figure even higher than the one Harris cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the professors added some caveats under which the owner could pay more state income tax than the Taco Bell worker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Qualified production income&quot; is a specific type of business income. Not all of the net income from a factory would necessarily qualify for the tax credits, which would mean the owner would be paying additional taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the factory owner&#39;s production income exceeds roughly $2.6 million, he would pay more income tax than the Taco Bell worker.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But it&#39;s worth noting that the owner&#39;s rate on that level of income would be only 0.15 percent (7.65 percent rate minus 7.5 percent credit), well below the 4 percent rate paid by the Taco Bell worker.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div><strong>Our rating</strong></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris said Grothman pushed through tax credits so that when they are phased in, &quot;someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income&quot; will pay &quot;less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the credits pushed by Grothman are fully phased in, in 2016, some factory owners who earn up to roughly $2.5 million from production income from the factory will owe less in state income tax on that production income than a full-time worker earning minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But factory owners earning above that amount from production income would pay more than the minimum-wage worker, and more on any other income that doesn&rsquo;t come from production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs clarification, our definition of Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this story, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-mark-harris-claim-about-taco-bell-workers-paying-more-tax-than-factory-owners-b99-274955691.html?ipad=y\">web page</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This item was changed on Sept. 15, 2014 to clarify that the tax rate on production income above roughly $2.6 million is effectively 0.15 percent.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-12T10:43:57.193386", "ruling_date": "2014-09-14T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "New Wisconsin tax breaks will let factory owners pay less income tax than Taco Bell workers?", "ruling_headline_slug": "new-wisconsin-tax-breaks-will-let-factory-owners-p", "ruling_link_text": "For a certain type of income and to a certain level, yes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WEKZ-FM/SlysOffice.com, <a href=\"http://www.slypodcasts.com/apps/blog/congressional-mark-harris-glenn-grothman-is-hiding\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with Mark Harris (quote at 8:50), Sept. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email interview, Mark Harris, Sept. 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/123245453.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Business production tax break added to state budget,&quot;</u></a> June 6, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Sen.
