That&rsquo;s why a recent claim that the costs are slowing down caught our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of CNN&#39;s <em>State of the Union</em>, Peter Orszag said, &quot;Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year.&quot; Orszag is the former director of the Office of Management and Budget for President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether this was correct. <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44582\"><u>Earlier this year</u></a>, the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress&rsquo; nonpartisan budget-analysis arm -- <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44582\"><u>projected </u></a>that the cost of Medicare would rise (from 3 percent of gross domestic product today to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2038) due in large part to the aging of the baby-boom generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Orszag&rsquo;s claim that Medicare costs are slowing down is notable and surprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, we had trouble finding monthly data for Medicare expenditures, but when we contacted Orszag, he pointed us to a CBO document, the &quot;<a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44938-MBR.pdf\"><u>Monthly Budget Review for November 2013</u></a>.&quot; (Orszag knows his CBO documents -- before taking the reins of OMB, he was CBO&rsquo;s director.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the document Orszag cited, CBO reported that, according to preliminary data, outlays for Medicare fell from $101 billion in October-November 2012 to $96 billion in October-November 2013. And the year-on-year decline was actually a little bit bigger once CBO smoothed out some calendar oddities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fits the bill for what Orszag claimed -- a year-over-year decline in &quot;nominal&quot; Medicare costs. In fact, Orszag told PolitiFact, this decline is &quot;all the more remarkable because the number of beneficiaries is rising.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, while an absolute decline in Medicare expenditures is especially notable, there is evidence that something less dramatic, but still noteworthy, has been underway for even longer -- a slowing of the growth of Medicare costs. That is, Medicare expenditures have recently been rising, but at a slower rate than in the past. This isn&rsquo;t as favorable for getting the federal budget into balance as an absolute decline would be, but it&rsquo;s still an important step in that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend is documented in an August 2013 <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44513_MedicareSpendingGrowth-8-22.pdf\"><u>CBO working paper</u></a>, written by a pair of present or former CBO health care analysts, Michael Levine and Melinda Buntin. They concluded that the growth in spending per beneficiary in Medicare&rsquo;s fee-for-service program &quot;has slowed substantially in recent years,&quot; specifically from 2000 to 2010. The authors said the slowdown &quot;has been widespread, extending across all of the major service categories, groups of beneficiaries that receive very different amounts of medical care, and all major regions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the authors noted that their understanding of why this expenditure slowdown occurred &quot;remains incomplete.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that is a problem that limits the usefulness of the data points Orszag offered on CNN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, past performance does not equal future performance, noted Joseph Antos, a health care specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The pattern Orszag cites &quot;does not mean a slower trend will last,&quot; Antos said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said she sees the recent data as a positive development, she added wistfully, &quot;If only anyone knew why and whether it will last.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orszag doesn&rsquo;t dispute their words of caution. &quot;I agree it&#39;s unclear how long it will last, but I am more hopeful than some others,&quot; he said, arguing that the decline in expenditures is &quot;consistent with major structural changes in the sector that I see happening every day. ... The bottom line is that it&#39;s not guaranteed to continue, but it&#39;s a huge deal if it does.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orszag said, &quot;Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year.&quot; He&rsquo;s right about the nominal decline in total Medicare expenditures over the past year, and he&rsquo;s right that per-beneficiary spending declined broadly between 2000 and 2010. Determining the reasons why it&rsquo;s happening remains a work in progress, but that doesn&rsquo;t detract from the statement&rsquo;s factual accuracy. We rate it True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-18T14:42:31.417054", "ruling_date": "2013-12-18T17:35:38", "ruling_headline": "Peter Orszag says Medicare spending has actually fallen in absolute terms over the past year", "ruling_headline_slug": "peter-orszag-says-medicare-spending-has-actually-f", "ruling_link_text": "He's right on the data; no one's certain why", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Peter Orszag, <a href=\"http://cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4395464\"><u>interview on CNN&#39;s </u><u>State of the Union</u></a>, Dec. 15, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44938-MBR.pdf\"><u>Monthly Budget Review for November 2013</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Levine and Melinda Buntin &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44513_MedicareSpendingGrowth-8-22.pdf\"><u>Why Has Growth in Spending for Fee-for-Service Medicare Slowed?</u></a>&quot; (Congressional Budget Office working paper), August 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44582\"><u>Federal Spending on the Government&rsquo;s Major Health Care Programs Is Projected to Rise Substantially Relative to GDP</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Becker&#39;s Hospital Review</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/racs-/-icd-9-/-icd-10/cms-health-spending-growth-to-stay-slow-in-2013.html\"><u>CMS: Health Spending Growth to Stay Slow in 2013</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Health Affairs</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/10/1820\"><u>National Health Expenditure Projections, 2012&ndash;22: Slow Growth Until Coverage Expands And Economy Improves</u></a>,&quot; September 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Don McLeod, spokesman for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Dec. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Joseph Antos, health care scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Dec. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W.
