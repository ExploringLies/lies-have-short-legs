We can do it again.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta&rsquo;s suburbs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact decided to check Gingrich&rsquo;s claims about the budget and debt, since he and other Republicans have criticized President Barack Obama&rsquo;s stewardship of the economy, hoping to convince voters that the incumbent doesn&#39;t deserve a second term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, the balanced budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits, of $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s only two balanced budgets he can claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow for Gingrich&rsquo;s comments about the debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe national debt was slightly above $4.8 trillion when Gingrich became House speaker in January 1995. By the time he left the position in January 1999, the debt was more than $5.6 trillion. That&rsquo;s an increase, not a decrease.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you look just at the two years Gingrich can claim credit for where the federal government was in surplus -- fiscal years 1998 and 1999 -- the government did pay down about $200 billion in debt. But that would be cherry-picking, because over the full four years of his speakership, the debt rose by about $800 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEfforts to contact Gingrich&rsquo;s top spokesman, Rick Tyler, were unsuccessful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo summarize, Gingrich was off on both claims concerning the budget. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it&rsquo;s a stretch for him to take credit for more than two of those years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for paying off $405 billion in debt, the data we found shows the debt actually increased during Gingrich&rsquo;s four-year tenure as speaker by more than $800 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Gingrich&rsquo;s claim False.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-11T20:49:51.162489", "ruling_date": "2011-05-11T21:15:11", "ruling_headline": "Newt Gingrich inaccurate in budget, debt claims in video announcement", "ruling_headline_slug": "newt-gingrich-inaccurate-budget-debt-claims-video-", "ruling_link_text": "Only part of these achievements on his watch", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNewt Gingrich campaign video, <a href=\"http://www.newt.org/\">http://www.newt.org/</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite House historical Table 1:1, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreasury Direct, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np</a></p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Newt", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 152, "last_name": "Gingrich", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "newt-gingrich", "pants_count": 12, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gingrichcutter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/152/", "total_count": 86, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<div style=\"background-color: transparent;\">\r\n\t&quot;For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt.&quot;</div>", "statement_context": "a presidential campaign announcement video", "statement_date": "2011-05-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
