And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them,&quot; Moore wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Polling shows that self-defense is the <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/gun_control/why_are_americans_buying_so_many_guns\">top reason most gun owners purchase their weapons</a>, but we wondered whether Moore&rsquo;s numbers were right. Do homicides during home invasions comprise 0.04 percent of all gun deaths in the United States? And are a third of those people killed with their own weapon?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to contact Moore to learn what sources he used, but didn&rsquo;t hear back. The figures we found in both cases are difficult to confirm, even for the experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Elusive statistics</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Problem No. 1: The term &quot;home invasion&quot; isn&rsquo;t necessarily used in crime-tracking data. Broadly, the term usually describes a break-in at a residence while the people who live there are present, or more specifically, when someone breaks into a home to rob or hurt the residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some jurisdictions use it and some don&rsquo;t, but there is no universal definition or dataset. What would be called a home invasion is often reclassified as the eventual crime committed by the suspect &mdash; a robbery, a physical attack or so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nvdrs/index.html\">National Violent Death Reporting System</a> tracks the location, weapon and crime being committed at the time of a violent death. But there&rsquo;s no distinction about whether it was during a home invasion, or with the victim&rsquo;s own firearm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/\">Uniform Crime Report</a> and its <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/addendum-for-submitting-cargo-theft-data/shr\">Supplementary Homicide Report</a>, which compile data voluntarily provided by local law enforcement agencies, track the number of homicides and whether another crime was being committed. Home invasion is not a specific category, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several experts on firearm statistics told us they hadn&rsquo;t seen a recent study on either home invasions ending in homicide or who owned the weapon used, but Moore&rsquo;s first point sounded somewhat reasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every year, there are about 100 burglary homicides in the U.S. If half of these were gun homicides, he would be in the right ballpark,&quot; University of Chicago Crime Lab co-director Harold Pollack said. &quot;So the statistic isn&rsquo;t wildly off base, but I haven&rsquo;t seen a rigorous analysis. There&rsquo;s no question that lethal home invasions are terrifying but rare events.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked 2015 FBI figures, for example, there were <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/expanded_homicide_data_table_10_murder_circumstances_by_relationship_2015.xls\">13,455 reported homicides</a>, and 102 of those happened during burglaries. That&rsquo;s 0.76 percent of all homicides &mdash; but there was no mention of the term home invasion, or the weapon used to commit the homicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out there is one study that did come close to defining things the way Moore did, but Moore overstated the reported figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vdhb.pdf\">2010 report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> noted that &quot;between 2003 and 2007, approximately 2.1 million household burglaries were reported to the FBI each year on average. Household burglaries ending in homicide made up 0.004% of all burglaries during that period.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s about 86 people killed during a burglary annually, but the 0.004 percent is from <em>all </em>burglaries, not just ones classified as home invasions. Furthermore, the report&rsquo;s 0.004 percent is 10 times less than the 0.04 percent figure Moore stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study also does not specify a gun was the murder weapon, but rather counts every homicide regardless of how it was committed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shannan Catalano, a statistician at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, said the datapoint was actually only a side note in her larger report from 2010, but showed how few homicide-related burglaries there were overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore appeared to take the figure from her study, she said, but for some reason got the percentage wrong. Catalano suggested it may have been a typographical error, but had no way of knowing Moore&rsquo;s intent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Catalano&rsquo;s broader study used data from her agency&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=245\">National Crime Victimization Survey</a>, which uses statistical samples from a cross-section of addresses around the United States to estimate crimes. She said she will update the study in 2018, using the <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=301\">National Incident Based Reporting System</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like everyone else we contacted, Catalano also did not know of a statistic that supported Moore&rsquo;s second assertion about a third of people being killed with their own gun during these attacks at home. Several studies <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/10/929/140858/Guns-in-the-Home-and-Risk-of-a-Violent-Death-in\">show owning a firearm</a> <a href=\"http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/9/1/48.full\">greatly increases the risk</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457502000490\">of unintentional gun-related deaths</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip Cook, a public policy professor at Duke University, said if a statistic showing people killed by their own weapon in home burglaries exists, it&rsquo;s not widely known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m quite sure that it&rsquo;s not part of any of the standard databases,&quot; Cook said. &quot;So it must be a one-time study by someone, probably of limited scope.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore said, &quot;People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04 percent of all gun murders in the U.S. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Moore has a point that guns are rarely used when someone breaks into a home, it is difficult to confirm. After interviewing several experts and agencies, we only found one study that came close to supporting Moore&rsquo;s assertion about the number of home invasion deaths. Even then, the report&rsquo;s author said Moore misstated the scope and specifics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our sources conceded that the homicide rate during burglaries is a tiny fraction of overall gun deaths, committed during burglaries or otherwise. But none of them, including federal agencies that track crime, could independently verify Moore&rsquo;s figures about the owner of the weapon used in those crimes the way he claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-10-25T16:23:42.083316", "ruling_date": "2017-10-25T17:24:36", "ruling_headline": "Michael Moore flubs stats on people killed with guns during home invasions", "ruling_headline_slug": "michael-moore-flubs-stats-people-killed-guns-durin", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers aren't right for rare events", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Michael Moore, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/posts/10154778028796857\">Facebook post</a>, Oct. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JAMANetwork.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/388816\">Weapon Involvement in Home Invasion Crimes</a>,&quot;
