That is, if you don&rsquo;t have health insurance from an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to insurance in the individual market, regardless of your health, and you can&rsquo;t be charged higher rates for a pre-existing condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/mapping-pre-existing-conditions-across-the-u-s/\">Before Obamacare, insurers</a> typically used medical underwriting &nbsp;&mdash; evaluating the health status, health history and other risk factors of an applicant &mdash; to determine whether to deny a person coverage. Even for people they did accept, insurers could carve out coverage of any specific pre-existing conditions, as well as charge people with health problems higher premiums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Baldwin&rsquo;s 2.4 million people figure, her campaign pointed us to <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/04/05/430059/number-americans-pre-existing-conditions-congressional-district/\">an estimate</a> by the <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/center-american-progress/\">Center for American Progress</a>, a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is a broad count. It includes not only people who could be denied insurance coverage &nbsp;&mdash; which is what Baldwin highlights in the TV ad &mdash; but also people who could buy coverage but be charged more because of a pre-existing condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, the latest estimate by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the gold-standard sources on health care, is based on the number of people in Wisconsin who had health conditions that <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/health-care/2018/09/20/walker-gives-no-detail-how-state-would-ensure-pre-existing-coverage/1352512002/\">likely would have left them uninsurable</a> before the Affordable Care Act. That estimate is much smaller: <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/pre-existing-conditions-and-medical-underwriting-in-the-individual-insurance-market-prior-to-the-aca/\">852,000</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there is a basis for Baldwin&rsquo;s 2.4 million figure. But it&rsquo;s misleadingly high in the context of the second part of her statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">2. Vukmir&rsquo;s position</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth noting, that if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, it&rsquo;s possible premiums for some people with pre-existing conditions could be so high as to make insurance virtually unaffordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vukmir has not specifically said that insurers should be able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said people with pre-existing conditions <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/04/senate-race-tammy-baldwin-leah-vukmir-clash-health-care/1157442002/\">should be covered</a>. But she has been vague on how that would happen. She has proposed &quot;allowing insurers to offer a wider variety of plans&quot; and enabling people to buy insurance across state lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Baldwin&rsquo;s ad says Vukmir supports letting insurance companies &quot;deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions,&quot; a footnote on the screen refers to <a href=\"https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/there-may-be-no-us-senate-race-with-a-starker/article_7ec2a835-b676-5799-87d1-97248d20f490.html\">three</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/08/01/634539877/under-new-rules-cheaper-short-term-health-care-plans-now-last-up-to-three-years\">news</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/18/16330574/cassidy-graham-preexisting-conditions\">stories</a>, but only one that mentions Vukmir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/there-may-be-no-us-senate-race-with-a-starker/article_7ec2a835-b676-5799-87d1-97248d20f490.html\">That story</a>, by the Wisconsin State Journal, reported how Vukmir <a href=\"https://leahvukmir.com/issues/healthcare/\">wants to</a> <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/04/senate-race-tammy-baldwin-leah-vukmir-clash-health-care/1157442002/\">fully repeal</a> Obamacare &nbsp;&mdash; which would mean also eliminating its guarantee against insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story also notes that Vukmir has supported GOP repeal bills in Congress that <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/\">would weaken</a> protections for people with pre-existing conditions. For example, she praised the GOP&rsquo;s American Health Care Act. It would have kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance -- but it would have dropped Obamacare&rsquo;s rules capping how much extra those people could be charged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the story reports that Vukmir supports returning to what Wisconsin offered before Obamacare &mdash; a publicly-subsidized high-risk pool for people with pre-existing conditions who couldn&rsquo;t get insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool was held up as <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/19/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-claim-wisconsin-being-model-covering-pe/\">something as a model</a>, at least for the people it covered.
