Marco Rubio misrepresented his stance on abortion for pregnant women with Zika in a new Spanish-language campaign ad trying to discredit his Democratic challenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ad, released Oct. 4, 2016, a speaker says U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy &quot;lies about Marco Rubio, when Marco has been there for us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The screen lifts an image from a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/i-PPDuqIrhY\">prior Murphy campaign ad</a> showing a woman standing on a beach with the words, &quot;Marco Rubio: &#39;No abortions for Zika-infected women.&#39; &quot; It then shows Murphy with a stamped &quot;FALSE.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/sep/23/patrick-murphy/rubio-would-not-allow-rape-or-incest-exceptions-ab/\">Murphy</a> and <a href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/sep/08/naral-pro-choice/naral-misleads-attack-marco-rubio-about-zika-fundi/\">groups that support abortion rights</a> have repeatedly attacked Rubio for saying he didn&rsquo;t believe in allowing abortions for pregnant women with the Zika virus, which has been linked to microcephaly in newborns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the reason they&rsquo;ve attacked him is because that&rsquo;s what Rubio said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>On the record</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2016/08/rubio-no-abortions-for-zika-infected-women-104555\">Aug. 8, 2016, story in Politico</a>, Rubio told reporter Marc Caputo he did not believe infected women had a right to an abortion, even if they suspected their child might be born with the birth defects associated with microcephaly. The quotation in the commercial refers to the story&#39;s headline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I understand a lot of people disagree with my view &mdash; but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it&rsquo;s a difficult question and a hard one. But if I&rsquo;m going to err, I&rsquo;m going to err on the side of life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comments came as Congress struggled over funding emergency relief for the disease, which has spread in Florida and nationwide over the summer. Politico&rsquo;s story was widely cited by other outlets afterward. Murphy and Rubio have batted attacks on Zika funding back and forth during the Senate campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy has attacked Rubio&rsquo;s stance on potential abortions in <a href=\"https://www.murphyforflorida.com/frontpage/2016/patrick-murphy-condemns-marco-rubios-comments-zika-abortion/\">statements</a> and a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/i-PPDuqIrhY\">campaign ad</a>. But this is the first time Rubio has said the Jupiter Democrat is misrepresenting him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been an English-language counterpart repeating Rubio&rsquo;s claim. His campaign did release an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jNWpuewRHqk\">ad in September accusing Murphy</a> of not telling the truth, but that ad omitted the Zika claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s campaign did not respond when we asked them why they said Murphy was lying about the subject. Spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas did not specify to the<em> Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald </em>Tallahassee bureau, either, only telling reporter Kristen Clark that Murphy has &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-lying-in-new-ad-about-his-position-on-abortion-for-zika-infected/2297364\">repeatedly distorted Marco&#39;s record</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to be sure Rubio wasn&rsquo;t misquoted, we double-checked with Politico&rsquo;s Caputo, who said he had ensured Rubio knew what he was going to write about the senator&rsquo;s opinion. He said Rubio did not object. Caputo also noted the campaign had not disputed the story after it published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They never said it was false,&quot; Caputo told PolitiFact Florida. &quot;They never expressed any doubt whatsoever.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy&rsquo;s campaign stood by their characterization of Rubio&rsquo;s position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Either Rubio is silently flip-flopping on his pro-life stance and forgot to let voters know, or he is blatantly lying in this ad,&quot; Murphy spokeswoman Galia Slayen said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said Murphy wrongly conveyed Rubio&#39;s stance on abortion for women infected by Zika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Spanish-language ad, Rubio disputed the notion that he does not believe in allowing pregnant women to get an abortion if they suspect their baby may suffer from Zika-related birth defects. Rubio confirmed that stance in an August story in Politico, which Murphy has subsequently cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unless Rubio has changed his position, which he hasn&rsquo;t stated publicly, the ad is wrong about Murphy misrepresenting Rubio&rsquo;s stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note, Oct. 17, 2016: </strong>This story has been updated to clarify the quotation.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4574bb68-c116-4562-9d5f-ac7ce20e741a\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4574bb68-c116-4562-9d5f-ac7ce20e741a</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-11T17:28:55.964070", "ruling_date": "2016-10-11T18:04:21", "ruling_headline": "Rubio mischaracterizes his own position on abortions for pregnant women with Zika", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-mischaracterizes-his-own-position-abortions-", "ruling_link_text": "Tripped up trying to discredit Patrick Murphy", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Sen.
