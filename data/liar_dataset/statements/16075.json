You&rsquo;re crippled with debt one day and the next it&rsquo;s all vanished into thin air. It&rsquo;s just one more thing that makes Canada the great country that it is!&rsquo; &quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>Millions of Canadians potheads lined up outside their local marijuana shops to legally purchase weed and pay their taxes for the first time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;It&rsquo;s like the 60s all over again! But this time the government likes us!&quot; said one Ottawa man, who purchased three hash brownies and a half dozen joints. &quot;Who would have thought getting stoned would have such a beneficial impact on the Canadian economy! This is better than the oil sands!&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Daily Bonnet &quot;is a Mennonite satirical news site from the heart of the Bible belt, Steinbach, Manitoba,&quot; the site&rsquo;s &quot;about us&quot; page says. &quot;Apart from the names of local and international celebrities, all characters and situations presented are entirely fictitious.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone sharing this without clearly noting that it&rsquo;s satire is sharing inaccurate content.
