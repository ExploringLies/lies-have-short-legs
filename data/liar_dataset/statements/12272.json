Polling evidence suggests that there may be reason for such a worry: An April <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article70202867.html\">McClatchy-Marist poll</a> found that 25 percent of Sanders supporters said they would not back Clinton as the Democratic nominee, compared to 69 percent who said they would support her. Another 6 percent were unsure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton addressed this during an April 21, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4874090?4\">town hall</a> with ABC&rsquo;s <em>Good Morning America</em>, comparing it to her 2008 primary bid against Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren&#39;t going to support Sen. Obama,&quot; Clinton said at the televised town hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, Clinton argued, if Obama can come back from even sharper divisions to win the presidency, then she can, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked into the polling archive to see if she has a good argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two polls taken in June 2008 that asked primary supporters of Clinton who they would support with Obama as the Democratic nominee.

The 2016 Marist poll uses terminology that&rsquo;s a bit vague -- the choices are &quot;support her&quot; or &quot;not support her.&quot; By contrast, the 2008 CNN poll was more specific, looking at whether people would vote for Obama, vote for Republican nominee John McCain, or wouldn&rsquo;t vote at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent polling data showed Obama did eventually win the support of Clinton backers. By<a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24497230.html\"> August 2008</a>, <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/three-months-until-election-day-new-lifetime-networks-every-woman-counts-poll-reveals-where-women-voters-stand-post-hillary-on-the-presidential-nominees-the-issues-and-the-first-woman-president-64866767.html\">polls showed</a> <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24497230.html\">that Obama was winning</a> 70 percent to 76 percent of Clinton supporters. And of course, Obama went on to win in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren&#39;t going to support Sen. Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wording of polls makes exact comparisons a bit tricky, but in general, Clinton is right about the scale of Obama&rsquo;s 2008 problem with dissident Democrats -- and correct that Obama had a harder road then than she seems to have now. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/53ab6eae-7c0b-47c8-b2f6-d6c89e991bf9\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/53ab6eae-7c0b-47c8-b2f6-d6c89e991bf9</a> ", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-21T16:30:07.105592", "ruling_date": "2016-04-21T16:46:04", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says history shows she can win over Bernie Sanders supporters", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-history-shows-win-bernie-sanders", "ruling_link_text": "She's in better shape now than Obama was then", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4874090?4\">town hall with ABC&rsquo;s <em>Good Morning America</em></a>, April 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediaite, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/how-bad-is-poll-that-says-25-of-bernie-sanders-fans-wont-vote-for-hillary/\">How Bad Is Poll That Says 25% of Bernie Sanders Fans Won&rsquo;t Vote For Hillary?</a>&quot; April 6th, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/26/AR2008062604162.html\">Hill, Yes!
