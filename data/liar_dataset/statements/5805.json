In more recent years, Kyrillos also has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as &quot;tax increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we&rsquo;ll talk about that tax increase on smokers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbout a month after then-Gov. Christine Whitman won re-election, the Republican-controlled Legislature on Dec. 18, 1997 approved Assembly bill A-2157. That legislation doubled the cigarette tax from 40 cents to 80 cents per pack, and the tobacco products wholesale tax from 24 percent to 48 percent of the wholesale price.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the minutes of that day&rsquo;s proceedings, Kyrillos was one of 33 senators to vote for the bill. The next day, Whitman signed the bill into law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlso, in 1998, Kyrillos was a co-sponsor of a bill to increase the gas tax, but since the measure never made it to the Senate floor, Kyrillos didn&#39;t get a chance to vote on it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s good enough to prove Kyrillos&rsquo; claim is wrong, but let&rsquo;s also look at his votes on what his own Republican colleagues have referred to as &quot;tax increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver the last several years, the Democrat-led Legislature has approved numerous tax and fee increases -- a subject that Republican legislators frequently criticize. In October, we fact-checked a claim by Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. that Democrats had increased taxes more than 115 times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalling them all &quot;tax increases,&quot; a Senate Republican spokesman sent us a list of tax increases, fee hikes and tax policy changes between fiscal years 2003 and 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKyrillos voted against most of those bills, but not all of them. Here are a couple of examples where -- by his own party&rsquo;s measure -- Kyrillos supported tax increases:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn January 2008, Kyrillos supported a bill that increased fees and penalties related to handling explosives. In June 2009, Kyrillos voted for legislation that, in part, allowed certain municipalities to impose a tax on car rentals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that Kyrillos has rejected certain major tax increases in recent years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, when the Legislature agreed in July 2006 to increase the sales tax to 7 percent and expand it to various transactions, Kyrillos said no. Kyrillos also rejected a measure in June 2009 to temporarily increase certain state income tax rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn response to our findings, Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin pointed to the senator&rsquo;s record of opposing &quot;broad-based tax increases, such as increases in income, sales and business taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCronin cited four of Kyrillos&rsquo; specific votes against new or increased taxes. Those measures included the sales tax increase in 2006; a hotel tax in 2003; a business tax increase in 2002; and a tax against health insurers in 2005.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Most recently, Senator Kyrillos supported Governor Chris Christie&rsquo;s local 2 percent property tax and spending cap,&quot; Cronin said in an e-mail, referring to a July 2010 vote in favor of the cap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an April 17 message on his campaign website, Kyrillos offered this biographical note: &quot;In my years in the State Legislature, I have never voted for a tax increase.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKyrillos has voted against certain major tax hikes -- such as increasing sales and income taxes -- but the senator is wrong to claim he &quot;never voted for a tax increase.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn December 1997, Kyrillos voted to double the tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco products. More recently, Kyrillos has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as &quot;tax increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/politifact_nj_us_senate_hopefu.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-26T14:42:18.167473", "ruling_date": "2012-04-29T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos claims he \u201cnever voted for a tax increase\u201d as a state legislator", "ruling_headline_slug": "us-senate-hopeful-joe-kyrillos-claims-he-never-vot", "ruling_link_text": "Never say \u2018never\u2019", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJoe Kyrillos&rsquo;s U.S. Senate campaign website, <a href=\"http://joekyrillos.com/blog/2012-04-17/never-voted-tax-increase\">Never Voted for a Tax Increase</a>, April 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, Legislature approves cigarette tax hike approves cigarette tax hike, Dec. 19, 1997<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, Governor comfortable asking smokers to cough up &#39;user fee&#39;, Dec. 20, 1997<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssembly Bill A-2157, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/9697/Bills/PL97/264_.HTM\">Increases cigarette tax by $0.40 per pack; increases tobacco products tax to 48%; annually dedicates $155 million to Health Care Subsidy Fund and $50 million for school facilities</a>, signed into law on Dec. 19, 1997<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and e-mail interviews with Thomas O&rsquo;Malley, supervising librarian of the law section at the <a href=\"http://www.njstatelib.org/contacts_by_area/slic_directory\">New Jersey State Library</a>, April 20 and 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSenate Journal, Minutes of Dec. 18, 1997 session<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/16/tom-kean-jr/tom-kean-jr-says-democratic-tax-hikes-chased-jobs-/\">Tom Kean Jr. says Democratic tax hikes chased jobs out of New Jersey</a>, Oct. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with John Gorman, spokesman for the New Jersey Senate Republicans, Oct. 11-14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Legislature, Bill Search, accessed April 23-25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/pdf/annual/1998.pdf\">Division of Taxation 1998 Annual Report</a>, accessed April 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interviews with Chapin Fay and Meaghan Cronin, representatives of state Sen.
