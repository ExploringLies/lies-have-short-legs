Stephen Martin also claimed that the KKK was created by Democrats. The Republican lawmaker soon retracted the statement after after PolitiFact Virginia started to investigate the origins of the KKK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/\">Reporter Sean Gorman discovered then</a> that the group&rsquo;s founding is murky but that &quot;historians generally agree it was founded by a handful of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity and it quickly changed into a violent group that terrorized newly empowered black and white Republicans in the South.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One historian confirmed there&rsquo;s a historic link between the Democrats and the KKK: Many angry Southern whites during the 1860s and 1870s were Democrats, and some joined the KKK. But according to J. Michael Martinez, who wrote the 2007 book &quot;Carpetbaggers, Cavalry and the KKK,&quot; it&rsquo;s misleading to say the Democratic Party founded the Klan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a more of a grassroots creation, Martinez said. Plus, the Democratic Party of the past is not the Democratic Party of today. From the 1930s onward, &quot;you think of the Democratic Party being considered the party of the disenfranchised,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carole Emberton, an associated professor at the University of Buffalo, agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to the white &lsquo;Dixiecrats&rsquo; flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the mid-19th century, various Klans in the South acted as a &quot;strong arm&quot; for many local Democratic politicians, Emberton said. The Confederate general believed to be the KKK&rsquo;s first Grand Dragon even spoke at the 1868 Democratic National Convention. By the time the Civil Rights Act became law, the Democratic Party supported so-called liberal causes that &quot;had been the banner of the Republican Party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some Democrats supported the KKK, there&rsquo;s &nbsp;no evidence the group was founded by their political party. And context matters&mdash;the anti-black Democratic Party of yore is not the party that Hillary Clinton belongs to today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-24T11:14:24.354208", "ruling_date": "2018-10-24T11:20:20", "ruling_headline": "No, the Democratic Party didn\u2019t create the Klu Klux Klan", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-democratic-party-didnt-create-klu-klux-klan", "ruling_link_text": "Dems joined the KKK, but the didn't found it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=340110479749173&amp;set=a.114002402359983&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">Facebook post</a> about the KKK&rsquo;s origins, Oct. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/08/24/president-trump-is-pushing-white-nationalist-ideas-into-mainstream/?utm_term=.003b634e66e4\">&quot;President Trump is pushing white nationalist ideas into the mainstream,&quot;</a> Aug. 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitFact Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/\">&quot;State Sen.
