Do that many state universities in California fail to offer American history courses?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&lsquo;The California system of universities&rsquo;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalifornia has a two-tiered university system, with 23 campuses in the California State University system and 10 University of California campuses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll 23 CSU campuses offer courses on U.S. History, the Constitution and American ideals, said Erik Fallis, media relations manager for the California State University &mdash; indeed, almost every student <a href=\"http://www.csumentor.edu/planning/transfer/inst_requirement.asp\">needs such a class (or two) to graduate</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story is slightly different at the University of California, which also has an <a href=\"http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/counselors/graduation-requirements/history/index.html\">American history and institutions requirement</a>. The graduation requirement can be satisfied with a high school class, except at UC Santa Barbara, which requires a college-level course.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes that mean the campuses don&rsquo;t offer American history courses? Not at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the nine University of California campuses that offer humanities classes &mdash; the San Francisco campus <a href=\"http://www.ucsf.edu/about/about-ucsf\">focuses exclusively on health sciences</a> &mdash; all nine offer American history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo those classes get to &quot;the roots of who we are,&quot; as Santorum said?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, among the <a href=\"http://history.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/courses\">offerings at UC Davis</a> is &quot;The American Revolution, 1763-1790.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.history.ucr.edu/Courses/america.pdf\">UC Riverside teaches </a>upper-division courses on &quot;Revolutionary America&quot; and &quot;The Early Republic: The United States, 1789-1848.&quot; <a href=\"http://history.ucsc.edu/courses/class-schedule-view.php\">UC Santa Cruz includes</a> a course on the &quot;U.S. Revolution: 1740-1815.&quot; <a href=\"http://history.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/courses?field_term_tid=All&amp;field_courseyears_tid=All&amp;field_couretypes_tid=5814\">UC Berkeley</a> addresses, &quot;The United States from Settlement to Civil War.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.history.ucla.edu/academics/courses\">UCLA has</a> &quot;History of the U.S. and Its Colonial Origins: 19th Century&quot; and &quot;Constitutional History of U.S.: Origins and Development of Constitutionalism in U.S.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBottom line, of 33 state universities in California, just one, a health sciences campus, doesn&rsquo;t teach American history &mdash; and nearly all graduates have to complete a related course to graduate, whether in high school or college.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat was Santorum talking about?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Santorum&rsquo;s reading</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted Santorum&rsquo;s campaign to ask for support for his claim but didn&rsquo;t hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we tried tracing his reading material ourselves.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEric Dolan, an editor for progressive news site Raw Story, noted that Santorum <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/02/santorum-claims-seven-or-eight-university-of-california-campuses-dont-teach-american-history/\">appeared to be making a reference</a> to a recent opinion piece in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303816504577312361540817878.html\">How California&#39;s Colleges Indoctrinate Students</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe March 30, 2012, column by Hoover Institution fellow Peter Berkowitz argues that higher education is politicized and declining in quality as its curriculum changes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe notes: &quot;None of the nine general campuses in the UC system requires students to study the history and institutions of the United States. None requires students to study Western civilization, and on seven of the nine UC campuses, including Berkeley, a survey course in Western civilization is not even offered.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBerkowitz is right that most University of California campuses don&rsquo;t require a college-level course, with the exception of Santa Barbara &mdash; though they do require at least a high-school level class.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe didn&rsquo;t check on class offerings in Western civilization, since that&rsquo;s not what Santorum said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBerkowitz also cites a recent report, called &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nas.org/images/documents/A_Crisis_of_Competence.pdf\">A Crisis of Competence</a>,&quot; from the National Association of Scholars, where he&rsquo;s on the board of directors. It mentions that &quot;the vast majority of our colleges have made a course on the broad themes of U.S. history or government optional.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen it points out a laudable exception: The California State University system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;All but three of the more than twenty campuses of the CSU system require American History and Institutions as an essential part of their curricula. But the situation in UC is very different: not a single UC campus has such a requirement. &hellip; To be sure, UC requires a year of U.S. history in high school for undergraduate admissions, but University of California level instruction ought to be on a completely different level &ndash; why otherwise would students need to go on to a university at all if high school coursework is equivalent?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum went much further than either Berkowitz or the National Association of Scholars report, declaring that at seven or eight universities in the California system, they &quot;don&rsquo;t even teach an American history course.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s simply no support for that claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRick Santorum said, &quot;I think it&rsquo;s seven or eight of the California system of universities don&rsquo;t even teach an American history course.
