He jumped out of the vehicle immediately and was grieving as he stood over the body. Moments later, a gunman, apparently enraged about the accident, shot the 40-year-old driver to death. But he also fatally wounded a 15-year-old, the toddler&rsquo;s brother, who had rushed to the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reacting to the incident, Mayor Tom Barrett <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/info-sought-after-crash-shooting-leaves-driver-2-children-dead-b99480121z1-299560371.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>linked</u></a> increases in fatal and non-fatal shootings in Milwaukee with gun laws. In turn, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. <a href=\"http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntySheriff/sheriffnews/2014-News--Release/041315SheriffClarkestatementonmayor27scommentsonfatalshootings.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>criticized</u></a> the mayor, saying Barrett was blaming concealed carry permit holders for more guns being on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, while <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/video/?bctid=4172730708001\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>speaking to reporters</u></a> on April 14, 2015, two days after the accident and double-shooting, responded to the sheriff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re the only place I know,&quot; Flynn said, referring to Wisconsin, &quot;where it&#39;s a misdemeanor to carry a gun illegally, but a felony for a second rap for carrying pot. Would you tell me how that makes sense?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Second arrest for carrying pot is a felony. Second, third, fourth, 10th arrest for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor. Is it any wonder these knuckleheads out there with guns aren&#39;t learning a lesson from getting locked up by us?&quot;\u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Flynn right about the Wisconsin laws?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except for some clarification, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Marijuana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carrying marijuana -- for a second offense and subsequent offenses -- is, in fact, a felony crime. But that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a felony charge will be filed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prosecutors generally have discretion in charging. &nbsp;So, while someone with a clean criminal record who is caught a second time carrying a marijuana joint technically has committed a felony offense, a prosecutor might decide to only issue a ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that carrying marijuana can be a felony on a first offense -- if you&rsquo;re carrying with the intent to deliver, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Coincidentally, the day before Flynn made his claim, state Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/democratic-legislator-to-introduce-bill-that-would-legalize-pot-b99480225z1-299566641.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>announced</u></a> she would introduce a bill to legalize marijuana in Wisconsin. With Republicans controlling both houses of the Legislature, the measure has virtually no chance of passing.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Guns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/125235719.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>legalized</u></a> the concealed carry of guns and other weapons in 2011. Carrying a concealed gun without a state-issued concealed carry license is a misdemeanor, for the first offense and for any subsequent offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that someone convicted of any misdemeanor on three separate occasions within five years can be sentenced to more time behind bars. So, someone convicted of carrying a concealed gun illegally could be punished more if they are also convicted of two other misdemeanors, whether gun-related or not, within five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, for certain people, carrying a gun is a felony on the first offense. That includes convicted felons and people who are subject to an injunction such as a domestic violence restraining order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flynn said that in Wisconsin, a &quot;second arrest for carrying pot is a felony,&quot; but a second or subsequent arrest &quot;for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A second arrest for carrying marijuana is classified as a felony offense, although depending on the circumstances, only a ticket might be issued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And generally a first or subsequent offense for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor -- although for some people, such as convicted felons, a first offense is a felony. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-flynn-claim-on-penalties-for-carrying-pot-vs-a-gun-b99482139z1-299889871.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-15T13:50:52.110828", "ruling_date": "2015-04-15T14:13:49", "ruling_headline": "In Wisconsin, carrying marijuana a second time is a felony but illegally carrying gun a misdemeanor?", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-carrying-marijuana-second-time-felony-il", "ruling_link_text": "Generally, yes, with some exceptions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/video/?bctid=4172730708001\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>video</u></a> of Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn speaking to reporters, April 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Milwaukee County Assistant District Attorney Joy Hammond, April 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Wisconsin Department of Justice Director of Communications and Public Affairs Anne Schwartz, April 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Milwaukee police Lt.
