So we did.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To quote the Internet, &#39;Merica!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To quote Anna Berkes, the research librarian at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello in Virginia, &quot;That sounds like something that he might have said or written, but in fact, he did not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that our third president, the lead author of the Declaration of Independence who left this earthly plane 188 years ago, remains a prolific &quot;author&quot; on the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He, too, has tackled topics as disparate as religion (&quot;The Bible is the source of liberty,&quot; a bogus quote) and the qualifications to run for political office (&quot;No man will ever bring out of that office the reputation which carries him into it,&quot; a verified quote).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The misattributions floating around the web got so bad that a few years ago, Berkes set up the Spurious Quotations page on the Monticello website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake posted by Hice is a common mistake that was first incorrectly attributed to Jefferson in 1853. Historians long attributed the quote to Henry David Thoreau, who used a variation of it in his 1849 essay, &quot;Civil Disobedience<em>,&quot; </em>to argue that individuals should not let governments to make them agents of injustice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New research indicates, though, that Thoreau himself was likely quoting the magazine, The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, where the sentiment first appeared in 1837, Berkes said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The opinion has been associated with Jefferson&rsquo;s Democratic-Republican party ideology, which is probably why people think he said it,&quot; Berkes said. &quot;The association is what has been called a natural Jeffersonian maxim. It&rsquo;s just not a Jefferson quote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hice did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He may, as Berkes&rsquo; suggests, find the dubious quotes still prove useful to convey a long-held ideology, regardless of the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, as librarian and Jefferson researcher Eyler Robert Coates concludes, the attribution may belie a misunderstanding of Jefferson&rsquo;s views. Coates argues the quote does not represent Jefferson because of its vague, abstract use of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;least.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that is clear, is that there is no verifiable evidence that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote the sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correcting the record would surely square with Jefferson, who once said, &quot;If we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, it is the responsibility of every American to be informed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, he <a href=\"http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/if-we-are-to-guard-against-ignorance-quotation\">didn&rsquo;t say that</a>, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Berkes&rsquo; carefully footnoted research, we can rate both our claim and that from Hice as False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-02T14:40:59.072797", "ruling_date": "2014-09-03T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "So says Thomas Jefferson?
