Roughly every dollar spent by the state is matched by the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During <a href=\"http://reinventingmedicaid.ri.gov/events/2015/3/2/reinventing-medicaid-task-force-first-public-meeting\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a March 2, 2015, presentation</u></a> to the Reinventing Medicaid Working Group, the state&#39;s secretary for health and human services, Elizabeth Roberts, <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54e689e7e4b01dbc2505f118/t/54f5bc27e4b0ebac9f9bc1f1/1425390631594/Working+Group+to+Reinvent+Medicaid+Presentation+%231+FINAL.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>displayed a slide</u></a> which said that nearly a third of all state tax dollars goes to Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;More than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid,&quot; the slide said. It also contained a pie chart in which Medicaid is shown eating up 31.5 percent of those tax dollars. The slide lists the source as the state budget for the 2013 fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on March 31, 2015, groups that want to create a single-payer health insurance system in the state <a href=\"http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150331/NEWS/150339834/13815\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>challenged that statistic and others</u></a> being used by the Raimondo administration in its<strong> </strong>push for Medicaid reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rhode Island chapters of Physicians for a National Health Program and HealthCare Now said the actual percentage isn&#39;t 31.5 for fiscal 2013, but closer to 22.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to see who was correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Roberts specifically mentioned &quot;state tax dollars,&quot; for this fact check, we will only look at general revenue funds raised by the state, not federal funds shared with the state or restricted funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Roberts&#39; office, spokesman Michael Raia said the source of the information was listed incorrectly. The 31.5 percent is based on the current fiscal year of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to data from the House Finance committee, this year the state is slated to <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/housefinance/ba/2014/FY%202015%20BAE%20Section%20VI%20Special%20Reports.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>spend $1.084 billion</u></a> of its unrestricted money on Medicaid. That&#39;s 31.5 percent of the <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/housefinance/ba/2014/FY%202015%20BAE%20Section%20II%20Statewide%20Overview.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$3.445 billion in general revenue funds</u></a>. (The state budget enacted that year totaled $8.78 billion, including restricted revenue and federal money for Medicaid and other things.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That made us curious. What were the numbers in 2013, the year cited incorrectly by Roberts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rhode Island Health Care Association, one of the groups questioning the numbers, referred us to the executive summary of <a href=\"http://www.budget.ri.gov/Documents/Prior%20Year%20Budgets/Operating%20Budget%202015/ExecutiveSummary/0_FY%202015%20Executive%20Summary.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gov. Lincoln Chafee&#39;s budget for the 2015 fiscal year</u></a>. Page A-5 listed $3.216 billion in general revenue for that year and page 71 of the budget&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.budget.ri.gov/Documents/Prior%20Year%20Budgets/Operating%20Budget%202015/TechAppendix/Complete%20FY%202015%20Technical%20Appendix.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>technical appendix</u></a> says the Office of Health and Human Services (OHHS) actually received $772 million from the general fund. That would be 24 percent, close to what the critics claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the 2013 enacted budget, <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/HouseFinance/WEB%20FY%202013%20BAE%20Section%20VI%20Special%20Reports.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>20 percent of the state&#39;s Medicaid money was spent by other departments</u></a>, including Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) and the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). That makes the 24 percent too low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When all of the state&rsquo;s spending for Medicaid out of its general revenues is accounted for, the percentage comes out to around 31 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberts said more than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She cited a specific percentage of 31.5 percent and said it came from the 2013 fiscal year. It&#39;s actually from the 2015 fiscal year. But the percentage from 2013 is very close to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberts may have gotten the source year wrong, but it turns out that either year produces the same result.
