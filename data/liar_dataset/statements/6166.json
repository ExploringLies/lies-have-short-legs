Scott Walker in early 2011, Democrat <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mahlon-mitchell/\">Mahlon Mitchell</a> lost his electoral debut in the state&rsquo;s historic recall elections on June 5, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut three days later, Mitchell -- <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/by_state/WI_Page_0605.html?SITE=CSPANELN&amp;SECTION=POLITICS\">defeated</a> 53 percent to 47 percent by GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch -- was hailed as a rising star at the state Democratic Party&rsquo;s annual convention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it wasn&rsquo;t surprising that Mitchell was among those chosen to criticize Republican <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/\">Mitt Romney</a> ahead of the presumptive presidential nominee&rsquo;s June 18, 2012 <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/159428595.html?ipad=y#%21page=11&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">visit</a> to Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitchell&rsquo;s line of attack: As Massachusetts governor, Romney cut millions for firefighters&rsquo; equipment. It carried extra weight because Mitchell is head of the Wisconsin firefighter union.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn June 12, 2012, Romney claimed that President Barack Obama wants to add more government jobs and said the nation doesn&rsquo;t &quot;need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same day, the Wisconsin Democratic Party issued a <a href=\"http://www.wisdems.org/news/press/view/2012-06-response-to-mitt-romneys-claim-that-we-dont-need-mor\">news release</a> in response, quoting Mitchell and a national Democratic Party spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitchell claimed in the release that Romney used a line-item veto to cut &quot;millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,&quot; including firefighters&#39; &quot;coats, pants, helmets and boots.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis claim was similar to one made a day earlier by an Obama <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/STEPHANIECUTTER.pdf\">campaign official</a> and another made days later by Vice President <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/news/entry/vp-fighting-for-first-responders\">Joe Biden</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs Mitchell right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Mitchell&rsquo;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked for evidence, Mitchell referred us to Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama&#39;s re-election campaign in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe cited a July 2006 veto Romney issued for line item 8000-0050 in Massachusetts&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2006/Chapter139\">2007 budget</a>, his last during his single four-year term as governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe item, which was <a href=\"http://www.massbudget.org/reports/pdf/FY07GAASupps9Cs.pdf\">restored</a> &nbsp;by the legislature, provided for $2.5 million in grants to local fire departments for firefighting equipment that would &quot;include, but is not limited to, turnout gear.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurnout gear, said <a href=\"http://pffm.org/index.cfm?zone=/unionactive/officers.cfm\">Edward Kelly</a>, Mitchell&rsquo;s counterpart with the Massachusetts firefighters <a href=\"http://pffm.org/index.cfm\">union</a>, generally includes a firefighter&rsquo;s coat and pants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s also how turnout gear is <a href=\"http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=1334&amp;itemID=30728&amp;URL=Press%20Room/A%20Reporter%27s%20Guide%20to%20Fire%20and%20the%20NFPA/Glossary\">described</a> by the National Fire Protection Association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Kelly said turnout gear could also be interpreted to include a helmet and boots. And in any case, the line item allowed local governments to spend the grant money on any type of fire safety equipment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Other views</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor context, we wondered whether Romney&rsquo;s veto was indicative of his treatment of fire departments and firefighters when he was governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKelly said Romney cut aid to local governments, which resulted in cuts in fire department funding and led to firefighter layoffs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA February 2012 <em>Boston Globe</em> <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-18/news/31075328_1_andrea-saul-mitt-romney-quinn-bill\">article</a> also mentioned the aid cuts in recounting how, as governor, &quot;Romney fiercely protected a costly and controversial perk for police officers after seeking and receiving the endorsement of the politically influential police unions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also contacted Jim Stergios, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.pioneerinstitute.org/about.php\">Pioneer Institute</a>, a Boston think tank that values &quot;free market principles, individual liberty and responsibility, and the ideal of effective, limited and accountable government.&quot; He said the Romney administration generally &quot;limited grant programs to municipalities because their view was that such programs represented a relatively unaccountable entry into local affairs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There was also a political principle at work,&quot; Stergios said in an email. &quot;Resist the usual small, targeted grants to local constituencies because they opened up all kinds of political fights among those constituencies (the firefighters got a grant, so shouldn&#39;t the police officers?) and localities (Bourne, Lawrence, and Worcester all wanted grants for fire stations, why shouldn&#39;t other communities?).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Romney&rsquo;s campaign for a response to Mitchell&rsquo;s claim. Spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger provided a video clip of comments Romney gave in response to an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwWA-MOy9U&amp;feature=youtu.be\">interview</a> question about his statement that the nation didn&rsquo;t need more firefighters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat had nothing to do with Mitchell&rsquo;s claim, so we emailed Brandenburger again, but got no reply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitchell said that as Massachusetts governor, Romney used a line-item veto to cut &quot;millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,&quot; including firefighters&#39; &quot;coats, pants, helmets and boots.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2006, Romney vetoed $2.5 million in grants for all types of fire safety equipment, including those Mitchell cited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Mitchell&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-27T14:52:54.760808", "ruling_date": "2012-07-01T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Romney cut millions for firefighter gear, Wisconsin Democrat and firefighter union head says", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-cut-millions-firefighter-gear-wisconsin-dem", "ruling_link_text": "Vetoed grants were for fire gear", "ruling_state": "Wisconsin", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin Democratic Party, Brad Woodhouse-Mahlon Mitchell <a href=\"http://www.wisdems.org/news/press/view/2012-06-response-to-mitt-romneys-claim-that-we-dont-need-mor\">news release</a>, June 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSalon.com, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/11/romneys_fight_against_firefighters/\">&quot;Romney&rsquo;s long assault on firefighters,&quot;</a> June 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, President Barack Obama Wisconsin campaign press secretary Gillian Morris, June 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Mitt Romney campaign spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger, June 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMassachusetts Legislature, <a href=\"http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2006/Chapter139\">fiscal 2007 budget and veto actions</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGov.
