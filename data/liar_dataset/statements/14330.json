A <em>Baltimore Morning News</em> reporter determined from flight paperwork that Ryan traveled with Lynch to Phoenix, specifically to attend the meeting with Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story launched into several melodramatic theories why the trio were meeting, including possibly brokering then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s &quot;freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no newspaper called the <em>Baltimore Morning News</em>, and there&rsquo;s no proof Ryan was at all involved in the meeting, because the story is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wazanews.tk is a website <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/wazanews.tk\">registered in Amsterdam</a>, but the <a href=\"http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/07/hey-theres-something-in-the-shadow-behind-you/\">story appeared to originate</a> on <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/ourlandofthefree.com\">OurLandOfTheFree.com</a>, which makes up its content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OurLandOfTheFree.com <a href=\"http://ourlandofthefree.com/about-us/\">said it</a> &quot;makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality.&quot; There is no contact information readily available on the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site followed up this story about Ryan joining Clinton and Lynch with several more posts. One said a Justice Department pilot was going to <a href=\"http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/07/that-mole-looks-bad-you-should-see-someone/\">spill the beans about the meeting</a> on Fox News, but <a href=\"http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/07/new-car-caviar-four-star-daydream/\">ended up being found dead</a> (but not before <a href=\"http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/07/breaking-dead-pilot-left-in-case-anything-happens-to-me-package/\">leaving behind details of the discussion</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, none of it is true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another example of a series of fake stories attempting to fool readers with a bogus saga about an oft-cited political event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note:</strong> The meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch was in 2016.
