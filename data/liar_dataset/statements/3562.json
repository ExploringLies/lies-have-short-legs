The e-mail began with this assertion:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Here&#39;s the most important thing you need to know about the Republicans&#39; new budget plan: It abolishes Medicare within 10 years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered: Would Medicare, a <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/History/\">46-year-old </a><a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/History/\">program</a> that just seven years ago was <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/History/\">expanded</a> under Republican President George W. Bush, really disappear?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs backup for its claim, MoveOn.org cited in the email a New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/us/politics/06ryan.html?hp\">article</a> that said the Republican budget plan would eventually privatize Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the article said nothing about abolishing Medicare, so we asked MoveOn.org if it had any other evidence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group cited this sentence from the GOP plan:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Starting in 2022, new Medicare beneficiaries will be enrolled in the same kind of health care program that members of Congress enjoy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat sentence speaks of how new Medicare beneficiaries in 2022 will be treated, so it doesn&rsquo;t support the MoveOn.org claim that Medicare will be abolished.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s dig in a little to get an understanding of what the House Republicans propose for Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs it exists now, Medicare <a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medicare-benefits/medicare-benefits-overview.aspx\">helps pay </a><a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medicare-benefits/medicare-benefits-overview.aspx\">for</a> doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the GOP plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-Ryan_Letter.pdf\">analysis</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPeople who turn 65 after 2022, the CBO analysis said, would get a &quot;premium support payment&quot; from Medicare. They would use that money toward the cost of buying private health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne result, the CBO said, would be that future Medicare recipients &quot;would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBottom line: Medicare would stay the same for people who turn 65 before 2022, but change -- significantly -- after that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with a variety of experts on the question of Medicare being abolished in 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey included two academics -- University of Minnesota health care finance professor <a href=\"http://www.csom.umn.edu/faculty-research/faculty.aspx?x500=paren010\">Stephen </a><a href=\"http://www.csom.umn.edu/faculty-research/faculty.aspx?x500=paren010\">Parente</a> and health care economics professor <a href=\"http://wws.princeton.edu/people/display_person.xml?netid=reinhard&amp;display=C\">Uwe </a><a href=\"http://wws.princeton.edu/people/display_person.xml?netid=reinhard&amp;display=C\">Reinhardt</a> of Princeton University; two liberal organizations -- the <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/\">Center on Budget and Policy </a><a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/\">Priorities</a> and <a href=\"http://www.familiesusa.org/about/\">Families USA</a>, which says it advocates for &quot;high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans&quot;; and two think tanks, the conservative <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/\">Heritage Foundation</a> and the conservative-leaning <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/\">American Enterprise Institute</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone of the six argued the House Republican plan &quot;abolishes&quot; Medicare. Families USA framed it more cautiously, saying the proposal would &quot;end Medicare as we know it by 2022.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat does the Truth-O-Meter say?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoveOn.org claimed that Ryan&rsquo;s budget plan &quot;abolishes Medicare within 10 years.&quot; The group provided no evidence that backs the claim. To be sure, the plan would change Medicare, significantly, starting in 2022. But for those who turn 65 before then, there would be no changes at all, even after 2022. And for the others, Medicare would change -- dramatically -- but it would still exist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoveOn.org went too far with its claim.
