But I would say that when he made the remarks about not going dirty, I do want to point out that we haven&#39;t yet taken out a negative ad. So I would ask you to stand on that pledge and ask that the negative ads, the slanderous ads against me, stop.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we saw the clip replayed on ABC&#39;s <em>This Week with Christiane Amanpour</em>, we were struck by O&#39;Donnell&#39;s comment that &quot;we haven&#39;t yet taken out a negative ad,&quot; given that we had spent the better part of a day dissecting an ad from O&#39;Donnell that all but portrayed Coons as the protagonist in a horror movie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5aJAyBp_S8\">minute-long ad</a>, featuring dark visuals and spooky music, portrays Coons -- the county executive of Delaware&#39;s populous New Castle County -- as a roving psychopath that she dubs &quot;The Taxman.&quot; Coons, the narrator intones, &quot;is taxing everything out here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad -- along with <a href=\"http://www.coonsthetaxman.com/\">an explanatory website</a> that uses similar visuals -- was unveiled on Oct. 11, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/casting-an-opponent-as-the-taxman/\">at which point it</a> <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/10/odonnell-video-the-tax-man-com.html\">gained wide</a> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43483.html\">media attention</a> due to the public fascination with the race. (O&#39;Donnell, a tea party favorite, had come from behind in the GOP primary to beat a long-serving establishment Republican, Mike Castle, turning a likely Republican seat into a likely Democratic seat.) PolitiFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/13/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-attacks-chris-coons-raising-tax/\">weighed in</a> on two parts of the &quot;TaxMan&quot; ad on Oct. 13 -- a full day before O&#39;Donnell&#39;s reference to not taking out negative ads in the debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it seemed pretty obvious to us that O&#39;Donnell was wrong. The &quot;TaxMan&quot; ad was &quot;paid for and authorized by&quot; Friends of Christine O&#39;Donnell, which by all indications is an offshoot of her campaign. On <a href=\"http://www.christine2010.com/\">O&#39;Donnell&#39;s campaign website</a>, the &quot;Donate Now&quot; page <a href=\"https://secure.piryx.com/donate/ObyCSaw9/Friends-of-Christine-ODonnell/miltrilsplash\">says it was paid for</a> by Friends of Christine O&#39;Donnell. And Friends of Christine O&#39;Donnell was also the sponsor of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGGAgljengs\">her famous &quot;I&#39;m You&quot;</a> ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo when O&#39;Donnell said that &quot;we haven&#39;t yet taken out a negative ad,&quot; she was wrong -- and had been wrong for at least two full days. We don&#39;t necessarily think negative ads are inherently bad; campaigns are about contrasting one candidate to another, so negative ads can play a valuable role, as long as they&#39;re accurate. We&#39;re not knocking O&#39;Donnell&#39;s use of a negative ad here; we&#39;re knocking her decision to use a negative ad and then deny that she did. We rate her claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-18T11:36:01.724575", "ruling_date": "2010-10-18T14:12:54", "ruling_headline": "Christine O'Donnell says she hasn't run a negative ad", "ruling_headline_slug": "christine-odonnell-says-she-hasnt-run-negative-ad", "ruling_link_text": "Except the one that paints her opponent as a roving psychopath", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1cIl4vHTY8&amp;feature=player_embedded#%21\" id=\"ry.z\" title=\"Video excerpt\">Video excerpt</a> from Coons-O&#39;Donnell debate at the Wilmington Rotary Club, Oct. 14, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFriends of Christine O&#39;Donnell, &quot;Chris Coons the Taxman&quot;
