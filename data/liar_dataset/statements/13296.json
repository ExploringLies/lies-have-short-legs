Ami Bera, D-Elk Grove, was sentenced to a year in prison this summer for making illegal contributions to his son&rsquo;s campaigns for Congress in 2010 and 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Bera, during a debate this week in&nbsp;Sacramento against Republican Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, his opponent in the race for the 7th Congressional District, said federal investigators found he had no prior knowledge of his father&rsquo;s illegal activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The U.S. Attorney was pretty clear. They did a thorough investigation. They were consistent that I was never the target of this investigation,&quot; Bera said. &quot;They were consistent that neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that&rsquo;s why they closed this case.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pp2vxQRVAOE\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Rep. Bera makes his claim at about the 6:20 minute mark in the video above.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moments later, Jones took issue with Bera&rsquo;s statement:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I disagree with the statement that the U.S. Attorney said they didn&rsquo;t know anything about it. I think what they said was they couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence to suggest Congressman Bera or his staff knew about it. And that&rsquo;s a difference.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had Bera taken statements by federal investigators out of context?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check the facts, with a focus on the portion of Bera&rsquo;s statement that the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office said &quot;neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that&rsquo;s why they closed this case.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back up the congressman&rsquo;s claim, the Bera campaign pointed to statements by the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office in May and September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-ami-bera-father-campaign-money-20160510-story.html\">acting U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert</a> said in a May news conference in Sacramento after Bera&rsquo;s father pleaded guilty to election fraud:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To date, there is no indication from what we&rsquo;ve learned in the investigation that either the congressman or his campaign staff knew of, or participated in,&quot; the crimes by Bera&rsquo;s father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September, Talbert&rsquo;s office released a prepared statement saying &quot;no other charges will be sought in this matter&quot; and that it had concluded its investigation into the illegal contributions. It did not elaborate further on why it closed the case. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office declined to address that question this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Bera&rsquo;s statement that federal investigators said he and his campaign &quot;had no idea what was going on&quot; mostly matches with Talbert&rsquo;s May comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, it&rsquo;s not entirely clear why the case was closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know for sure without an explanation from the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office, which declined to elaborate on the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we do know is Bera was investigated and no charges were brought against him. Bera&rsquo;s statement is not far from the mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have been completely correct, however, if Bera had repeated what the U.S. attorney said that there was &quot;no indication&quot; he or his campaign had any connection to the crime. His statement could have benefited from this key clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ae0f519-815a-4e09-9a7f-4bdf3b53a80b\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ae0f519-815a-4e09-9a7f-4bdf3b53a80b</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-19T19:50:25.678169", "ruling_date": "2016-10-19T17:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ami Bera\u2019s Mostly True claim: Feds cleared me of election fraud", "ruling_headline_slug": "ami-beras-mostly-true-claim-feds-cleared-me-electi", "ruling_link_text": "U.S. Attorney said 'no indication' Bera involved in fraud", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ami Bera, 7th Congressional District debate, Oct. 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Jones, 7th Congressional District debate, Oct. 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bera for Congress, <a href=\"http://www.beraforcongress.com/press/rep-bera-statement-court-hearing\">Rep.
