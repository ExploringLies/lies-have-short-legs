It includes a map based on information from the National Conference of State Legislatures showing 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, ranging from adult recreational use to medical use to &quot;limited medical&quot; use in several states allowing &quot;cannabis extracts.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on that map, the vast majority of Americans do live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s also the broadest collection of states we found and stretches the case on whether a state has really legalized any form of marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to limit our count to states where voters or a state legislature has approved a comprehensive law authorizing medical or recreational marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found 29 states, plus Washington D.C., that meet that criteria, based on news reports. Nine have legalized recreational marijuana while the rest have legalized medical marijuana. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://e.infogram.com/a91ecd9e-7467-4be3-a1c2-6ee481d5bc62?src=embed\" style=\"border:none;\" title=\"Marijuana Laws\" width=\"550\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px\"><a href=\"https://infogram.com/a91ecd9e-7467-4be3-a1c2-6ee481d5bc62\" style=\"color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;\" target=\"_blank\">Marijuana Laws</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://infogram.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;\" target=\"_blank\">Infogram</a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with this smaller group of states, however, Chiang&rsquo;s statement holds up.
