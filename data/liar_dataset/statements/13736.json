It&#39;s also important to remember the pool of refugees we&#39;re talking about is about 1,400&nbsp;people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s data comes from information maintained by the State Department&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://ireports.wrapsnet.org/Interactive-Reporting/EnumType/Report?ItemPath=/rpt_WebArrivalsReports/Map%20-%20Arrivals%20by%20State%20and%20Nationality\">Refugee Processing Center</a>.

No refugees were recorded from Libya and Yemen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The makeup of refugees entering the United States looked a little different after Trump&rsquo;s first day as president Jan. 20. Basically, there were more refugees arriving from other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the week before his Jan. 27 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">order</a>, the United States processed 2,108 refugees. The percentage of refugees from the seven countries in the order was lower,&nbsp;but 44 percent (as opposed to 72 percent) were were from those seven countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of refugees entering the United States from the seven countries targeted in the order has steadily increased since Feb. 3, while the refugee arrivals from countries not affected by the order has fallen, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Feb. 11, Trump tweeted &quot;Our legal system is broken!&quot; and cited a <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/9/refugees-entering-us-doubled-rate-ruling-trump-tra/\">report</a> in the <em>Washington Times</em> showing that 77 percent of the refugees who entered the United States since had been from the seven &quot;suspect countries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that 72 percent of the refugees admitted into United States between Feb. 3 and Feb. 11 were from seven countries his executive order targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Refugee Processing Center, of the 1,462 refugees entering the United States between that time frame, roughly 72 percent were from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Sudan.
