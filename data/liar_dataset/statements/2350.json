You&#39;ve been had.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bogus rumor was started by Amanda Terkel, a senior political reporter for the <em>Huffington Post</em>. Shortly after 10 a.m. she posted to her <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aterkel\" id=\"mw35\" title=\"Twitter account\">Twitter account</a> &quot;Lindsey Graham endorses Charlie Crist, says he&#39;s &#39;exactly what the national Republican Party needs.&#39; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe realized she&#39;d made a mistake within five minutes, but not before her message had been seen and reposted by hundreds of others. She quickly tried to stop the news from spreading, firing off a quick succession of Tweets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTerkel was looking at an old press release from when Crist was running for Senate as a Republican. The release was sent out on Sept. 8 by Democratic candidate Kendrick Meek&#39;s campaign. The Meek campaign has been resending old Crist releases in recent days to highlight his ties to Republicans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTerkel&#39;s follow-up Tweets:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>&quot;Scratch my last tweet.

But it was dated 5/26/09.<br />\r\n\t</i></i></i></i>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor the record, we checked with Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop about the endorsement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is an &#39;old&#39; endorsement, pre-Crist leaving the GOP,&quot; Bishop said in an e-mail. &quot;Senator Graham is supporting Rubio.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBishop included a helpful timeline explaining Graham&#39;s one-time support for Crist.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSen. Lindsey Graham endorsed Gov. Crist on May 18, 2009, when he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate.&nbsp; Fund for America&rsquo;s Future, Sen. Graham&#39;s leadership PAC, made financial contributions to the Crist campaign of $1,000 on June 15, 2009, and $4,000 on Dec. 21, 2009.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWhen Gov. Crist announced that he was no longer a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, we sent a letter to the treasurer of the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign asking that the $5,000 be refunded and that Sen. Graham&#39;s endorsement be removed from the campaign&rsquo;s website and literature.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSen. Graham is supporting Republican nominee Marco Rubio in the Florida Senate race. Sen. Graham has co-hosted a Rubio reception in Washington and Fund for America&#39;s Future gave the maximum $5,000 contribution to the Rubio campaign in August.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGraham endorsed the Republican version of Crist back in 2009, but yanked that support when Crist announced he was leaving the party. The old endorsement came back to haunt Graham, and Crist, on Twitter. But don&#39;t be fooled. We rate it Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-08T11:13:50.545346", "ruling_date": "2010-09-08T11:52:07", "ruling_headline": "Lindsey Graham endorses Charlie Crist talk spreads quickly on Twitter", "ruling_headline_slug": "lindsey-graham-endorses-charlie-crist-talk-spreads", "ruling_link_text": "A reposted endorsement from 2009", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Kevin Bishop, spokesman for Lindsey Graham, Sept. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwitter search <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=23918408980&amp;page=1&amp;q=%22lindsey+graham%22\">&quot;Lindsey Graham&quot;</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwitter page, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aterkel\">Amanda Terkel</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "", "false_count": 82, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 280, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 416, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tLindsey Graham endorsed Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "postings on Twitter", "statement_date": "2010-09-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 15, "current_job": "", "false_count": 9, "first_name": "Charlie", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 257, "last_name": "Crist", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "charlie-crist", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/crist.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/257/", "total_count": 90, "true_count": 15, "website": ""}, {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Lindsey", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "South Carolina", "id": 64, "last_name": "Graham", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "lindsey-graham", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Lindsey_Graham.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/64/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
