Under state law, lobbyists are required to register with the commission and list their clients annually;<strong> </strong>the filings are <a href=\"http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/dfs/loblists.htm#L2012\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>available online</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Natalia Ashley of the Texas Ethics Commission staff<strong> </strong>said whenever a lobbyist gets a client, he or she must amend their registration. When this happens, the agency&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>public lobbyist-client lists are updated, she said. And when there is an update, she said, the new breakdown replaces the previous version posted online, &quot;so we don&rsquo;t keep a printed document for each update.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still with us? This was significant for our purposes, we realized, because a lobbyist-client list for 2015 about the moment Claunch spoke wasn&rsquo;t readily available to us a few days later.<strong> </strong>By the time we inquired, that particular list had been overtaken online by updated versions possibly presenting information that would not have existed when Claunch spoke. To fairly check his claim, then, we considered a next-best thing, the agency&rsquo;s lobbyist-client list for cities covering 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And according to that <a href=\"http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/tedd/conlob2014a.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2014 Lobby List</u></a>, updated by the state<strong> </strong>Jan. 9, 2015, the City of Austin had 22 state-registered lobbyists in 2014, a total greater than the count shown for any of 89 other municipalities.

Possibly not, a City of Austin official suggested. John Hrncir, a city<strong> </strong>governmental relations officer, told us that even though 22 people were listed as lobbying for the city in 2014, he directly consulted with less than half that many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, a City of San Antonio official said by phone the number of lobbyists shown in state filings as representing that city do not reflect the lobbyists he regularly consults. Jeff Coyle, San Antonio&rsquo;s director of intergovernmental relations, said he communicates actively with about four or five of San Antonio&rsquo;s nine contracted lobbyists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brie Franco, legislative attorney for the City of El Paso, said by phone that she talks directly to three of the four lobbyists listed as representing the city in state records. El Paso hired the firm Focused Advocacy to represent its interests in the legislative session, the same firm enlisted by West Lake Hills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hrncir said that when a lobbying firm tells the ethics commission its clients and expected payments, the firm may specify all employees with any possibility of doing work on behalf of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ran Hrncir&rsquo;s analysis<strong> </strong>by Jack Gullahorn, president of the <a href=\"http://www.texasadvocacy.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Professional Advocacy Association of Texas</u></a>, which says it&rsquo;s the only recognized statewide association for the lobby and government affairs community. By phone, Gullahorn said Hrncir was correct and added that the entirety of lobbyists in a firm routinely register for all of the clients listed underneath the firm even though someone at the practice may be the primary contact. Lobbyists do this &quot;to be conservative in following the law,&quot; Gullahorn said, by ensuring they don&rsquo;t get in trouble with the state if someone is found lobbying for the city without reporting that in advance.<strong> </strong>According to an ethics commission <a href=\"http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/guides/lobby_guide.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report on laws affecting lobbyists</u></a>, each lobbyist must provide information about each client &nbsp;that employs, retains or reimburses them to lobby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spending on lobbyists</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s one thing for Austin to have the most lobbyists indicating they&rsquo;re out there walking the pink building on its behalf. We also looked into how the city stacks up in spending on contract lobbyists at the Capitol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=222299\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>resolution</u></a> approved without debate at the Austin City Council&rsquo;s Nov. 20, 2014, meeting, council members agreed to contract with 10 lobbying firms for the 2015 legislative session for an amount not to exceed $805,000 all together. But there were a couple changes after that, Hrncir said, because lobbyists Randy Erben and Luis Saenz joined the administration of Gov. Greg Abbott. Hrncir said the city made an individual contract with Brian Yarbrough, Erben&rsquo;s previous partner.<strong> </strong>Jennifer Rodriguez from McGuireWoods Consulting was to assume Saenz&rsquo;s role on the city&rsquo;s part, Hrncir said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Lobby Firms Hired by City of Austin Before 2015 Legislative Session</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:medium none; width:600px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>FIRM</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FIRM OR LOBBYIST EXPECTS FROM THE CITY FOR LOBBYING</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Nora Del Bosque</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$65,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Randall Erben*/Erben &amp; Yarbrough</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$90,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Marta Greytok Consulting</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$90,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Cliff Johnson</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$90,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Demetrius McDaniel/GreenbergTaurig</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$90,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Clayton Pope</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$90,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Luis Saenz*/McGuireWoods Consulting</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$70,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Trent Townsend/Imperium Public Affairs</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$65,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Joe D.
