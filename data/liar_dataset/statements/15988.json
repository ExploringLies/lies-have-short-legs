That&#39;s right in the middle of states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, one in five Floridians were paid $10 or less an hour, according to the 2017 <a href=\"https://risep.fiu.edu/press-room/2017/the-state-of-working-florida-2017/state-or-working-florida-2017.pdf\">State of Working Florida</a> report from Florida International University&rsquo;s Center for Labor Research and Studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report shows that Florida lags the national trend of rising median wages. The state&rsquo;s 2016 median wage of $16.03 an hour was the lowest in 11 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Gillum&rsquo;s point is that this situation has gotten worse under Gov. Scott, then there is evidence in support of this claim,&quot; Donaldson said. &quot;The share of low-wage jobs in Florida has grown by two percentage points over the last eight years, the 10th-sharpest increase in the nation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an email, Gillum&rsquo;s campaign pointed to an <a href=\"https://www.gainesville.com/news/20180804/floridas-job-growth-brisk-but-largely-at-low-wages\">article</a> from the Gainesville Sun that highlighted the increase in low-wage jobs since the recession, indeed making that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low-wage jobs have accounted for nearly one in every two jobs created in Florida between 2005 and 2016, according to the 2017 State of Working Florida report. More than 392,000 of the 883,000 jobs created during this time paid $10 or less an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum said that Florida&rsquo;s economy was propped up on low-wage jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that some of Florida&rsquo;s job growth has been in low-wage jobs, and that the median wage level is the lowest in 11 years. However, there has been job growth in higher-paying jobs as well, and Florida is ranked 26th in low-wage jobs compared to other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum has a point but additional context is needed.
