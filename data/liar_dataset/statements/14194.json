House and Senate have each passed budget proposals, and now they&rsquo;re negotiating which provisions to keep and which to change or jettison. One of the main budget writers in the House said that if his chamber gets its way on Pre-K funding, that waiting list could go away entirely &ndash; giving thousands of needy children an educational head start that their parents might not otherwise be able to afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The waiting list for Pre-K is over in the House budget,&quot; Rep. David Lewis, a Harnett County&nbsp;Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we started combing through the 356-page budget proposal to find out if he was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Broad political agreement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Lewis is right &ndash; and if the final version of the budget ends up going in this direction &ndash; it would be a moment of bipartisan agreement. Expanding NC Pre-K was also one of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper&rsquo;s campaign promises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re tracking about three dozen promises Cooper made on our Coop-O-Meter and have rated the Pre-K promise as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/promises/coop-o-meter/promise/1321/expand-pre-k/\">In The Works</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state reported that for the current school year, NC Pre-K enrolled 27,019 children &ndash; with another 4,668 on the waiting list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State law caps Pre-K class sizes at 18 students, and there has to be one teacher for every nine students in a classroom. That means cutting down on the waiting list requires finding space for new classrooms, hiring more teachers or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how much will it cost to ensure that no eligible children are turned away?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budget proposals from the the state Senate and the governor&rsquo;s office both estimated that each new seat costs around $5,200, and the program as a whole costs the state about $5,500 per seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An initial look into Lewis&rsquo; claim, on the other hand, appeared to show the House relying on estimates that were only half that much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sent an inquiry to Ellen Peisner-Feinberg, a Pre-K expert at UNC-Chapel Hill who is also the director of the <a href=\"http://prekeval.fpg.unc.edu/\">National Pre-K and Early Learning Evaluation Center</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She called that math &quot;curious.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we wondered if the House discovered a way for the program to use funding more efficiently, or if perhaps something was amiss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That led us to get in touch with some state budget officials. They said there&rsquo;s a perfectly reasonable explanation &ndash; and that Lewis was neither wrong nor using faulty accounting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crunching the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House, Senate and governor&rsquo;s office all agree that North Carolina should use $6 million in federal grant money next school year and $12.2 million in 2018-19 to expand Pre-K funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate plan stops there. But Cooper would double it by matching that federal money with state funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House budget initially appears to follow the Senate plan, which led to the initial confusion. But in reality, the House &ndash; like Cooper &ndash; would require a state match. The average budget explorer might not realize that, however,&nbsp;because House budget writers omitted the additional state funds from some documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The House says it in their narrative but it doesn&#39;t show it in their numbers,&quot; said Pam Kilpatrick, North Carolina&rsquo;s senior assistant state budget officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House, Senate and Cooper all agree it will cost right around $5,200 for each new seat. And those estimates jibe with recent history. Last year the state spent an extra $1.325 million on NC Pre-K and created 260 new seats, for an average of $5,096 per seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kilpatrick, the state budget expert, agreed that using both the federal funds and matching state money ought to be enough to get rid of the existing waiting list &ndash; just like Lewis said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re definitely in agreement,&quot; Kilpatrick said. &quot;It&#39;s right on the money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Carolina Republican Rep. David Lewis, a top budget writer in the House of Representatives, said that chamber&rsquo;s budget will eliminate the waiting list for NC Pre-K.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program, which serves needy children and military families, turned down 4,668 children this year due to a lack of seats, according to the state. And Lewis is right that the House&rsquo;s version of the budget has enough money to create at least that many new seats if it becomes law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-07T10:49:17.100546", "ruling_date": "2017-06-06T18:10:37", "ruling_headline": "Thousands more children and families could soon get access to free Pre-K, NC legislator says", "ruling_headline_slug": "thousands-more-children-and-families-could-soon-ge", "ruling_link_text": "Nearly 5,000 children turned away last year", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Public Schools First NC <a href=\"http://www.publicschoolsfirstnc.org/education-budget/\">&quot;Education Budget,&quot; highlights from 2013 to present</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institute for Early Education Research, <a href=\"http://nieer.org/state-preschool-yearbooks/yearbook2016\">state-specific statistics about Pre-K programs</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NC Department of Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://ncchildcare.nc.gov/pdf_forms/NCPre-K_AdditionalFAQSiteSelectionProcess.pdf\">&quot;NC Pre-K FAQ&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with <a href=\"http://fpg.unc.edu/node/750\">Ellen S.
