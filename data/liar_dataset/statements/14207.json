It even appeared on an <a href=\"http://dailytimes.com.pk/tv-film/07-Mar-16/keanu-reevess-another-powerful-message-for-the-world\">English-language Pakistani newspaper&rsquo;s</a> website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found the quote attributed to him in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXpLdooyYz4\">Russian-language video</a> that appears to show him saying it (we used the translated captions) &mdash; but it actually <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ByVKueofLNo\">shows him talking about</a> a <a href=\"http://app.gauguin.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/\">Paul Gauguin exhibit</a> in Switzerland. Another video example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iNnwF4snPA\">used a computerized voice</a> to recite the quote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also appeared on Facebook.

The page&rsquo;s About section said Reeves was allowed to post on the page or moderate as he saw fit. There was no contact information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Reeves&rsquo; publicist, Cheryl Maisel of talent agency <a href=\"http://www.pmkbnc.com/\">PMK-BNC</a>, said the actor had no affiliation with the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Keanu does not participate in any form of social media,&quot; she said via email. &quot;This Facebook page is fake.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maisel told us she had the entire fan page removed from Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/21/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-alan-greenspan-said-insecur/\">wouldn&rsquo;t be</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/ivanka-trump/book-john-quincy-adams-quote/\">the first time</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/mar/23/hillary-clinton-quotes-Internet-complete/\">a famous person was</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/may/28/teabagger-group-makes-splash-fake-quote-memes/\">misquoted on the Internet</a>, of course.
