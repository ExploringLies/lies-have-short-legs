Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton singled out Rubio&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>proposed tax plan: &quot;Another priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Sen. Rubio&#39;s would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact-check the somewhat intricate claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rubio&rsquo;s plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign directed us to a <a href=\"http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2015/04/16/rubio-tries-to-triangulate-tax-policy/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>blog post</u></a> from the Tax Policy Center<strong>, </strong>an independent think tank that analyzes tax policy. The article concerns Rubio&rsquo;s plan in general, but the pertinent part reads, &quot;Those in the top 0.1 percent, who make $3.3 million and up, would be in line for an average tax cut of $240,000 &mdash; a boost in after-tax income of 3.8 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is $240,000 more than &quot;three times&quot; the earning power of a typical family? Her campaign pointed us<strong> </strong>to U.S. Census Bureau data that showed median household income<strong> </strong>as $53,046 for the period 2009 to 2013. So those numbers back up Clinton&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is one minor complication: The article from the Tax Policy Center is based on an analysis of Utah Sen. Mike Lee&rsquo;s 2013 plan, <em>not</em> Rubio&rsquo;s plan (actually a joint venture with Lee) that was released in 2015 and is similar to the original Lee plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, the Rubio-Lee plan groups people into two income tax brackets, 15 percent or 35 percent, the higher of which would kick in at an individual income of $75,000. That&rsquo;s a decrease from the seven brackets currently in place. Another centerpiece of the plan is a $2,500 tax credit given to parents for each child under sixteen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the broad outline, but the plan still lacks some details.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are critical unresolved issues that make it difficult for us to do an analysis of Rubio&rsquo;s current plan,&quot; said Howard Gleckman, resident fellow at the Tax Policy Center and author of the blog post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Gleckman points out that the Rubio-Lee plan <a href=\"http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2015/03/27/do-senators-lee-and-rubio-have-a-secret-plan-to-help-poor-families/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>never specifies</u></a> exactly what would happen to a<strong> </strong>personal tax credit of $2,000, a subsidy that would be available to anybody who claimed it on their tax returns. If it were included as a refundable tax credit (meaning people could get a check back), it would have a significant impact on low-income families. As of now, their incomes would actually decrease under the Lee plan, according to the Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Qualitatively, the rough sense is a very generous tax cut for high-income people,&quot; said Gleckman, adding, &quot;What we&rsquo;re not sure about is low-income people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So low-income people might get some kind of tax break under Rubio&rsquo;s plan, or they might not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other thing to know about Clinton&rsquo;s statement is that the wealthy get a tax break under Rubio&rsquo;s plan because he wants tax reductions, and the wealthy pay the most taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The reason why the top is getting what&rsquo;s seemingly a big tax cut is that they&rsquo;re already taxed at a much higher rate,&quot; said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. Under the Rubio plan, the top tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pomerleau added that it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that the plan proposes tax cuts across all income brackets, not just the top ones, and often at higher percentages for those with lower incomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pomerleau, however, did say that he found Clinton&rsquo;s claim plausible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that Rubio&rsquo;s tax plan &quot;would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is possible to take issue with the statement in some ways. The source of her claim uses an earlier version of Rubio&rsquo;s plan in its analysis, &nbsp;and&nbsp;she said $3 million when she should have said $3.3 million. But&nbsp;the thrust of her statement is sound. An analysis of a plan extremely similar to the one put forth by Rubio would cut taxes for those making $3.3 million and more by nearly $240,000, which is more than three times the U.S. median household income of $53,046. We rate her statement Mostly<strong> </strong>True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-15T14:09:43.712953", "ruling_date": "2015-07-16T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Would Rubio's tax plan mean a big break for millionaires?
