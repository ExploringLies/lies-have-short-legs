So ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009,&quot; Ocasio-Cortez stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s claim had us wondering: Is ICE required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every night?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the experts we spoke to told us ICE faces pressure from a variety of places to detain a large number of people, we found the legislation Ocasio-Cortez was referring to doesn&rsquo;t require ICE to detain 34,000 people a day. Rather, it requires ICE to maintain 34,000 available beds a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Beds, not people&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez was referring to a clause in the DHS <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr2029/BILLS-114hr2029enr.pdf\">Appropriations Act of 2016</a>, which states that with the funds it receives from Congress through the act, ICE &quot;shall maintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds through September 30, 2016.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://cis.org/Vaughan/DHS-Sec-Johnson-Disputes-Detention-Bed-Mandate\">According to</a> Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, the mandate exists because Congress wants to &quot;make sure that ICE does not use the detention bed money for something less effective.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mandate first appeared in the DHS <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ83/pdf/PLAW-111publ83.pdf\">Appropriations Act of 2010</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while Congress requires ICE to make 34,000 beds available each day, it doesn&rsquo;t require those beds to be filled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&#39;t the first time this figure has come up. During a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499837/rep-labrador-bed-quota\">congressional hearing</a> in 2014, U.S. Rep. Ra&uacute;l Labrador, R-Idaho, asked then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson for clarification on the detention bed quota, as it is known. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is nothing in the law that is mandating you to put 34,000 people on these beds. Is that correct?&quot; Labrador asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To which Johnson responded: &quot;I don&rsquo;t read the law that way. It doesn&rsquo;t read that way &hellip; It says beds, not people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Margulies, a professor of law at Roger Williams University, told us, &quot;unfortunately, this became a little bit of an urban legend, in a way, about what the appropriations statute required.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An ICE official also confirmed to PolitiFact that the language in the appropriations bills require ICE to maintain at least 34,000 beds each day, but don&rsquo;t require ICE to fill those beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, according to <a href=\"https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_14-116_Aug14.pdf\">a DHS report</a>, in order to track compliance with the congressional mandate, ICE measures its &quot;average daily population.&quot; So while the letter of the law may not require ICE to detain 34,000 people each day, it may have been in ICE&rsquo;s best interest to act like it did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unwritten rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under DHS Secretary Johnson, ICE&rsquo;s position was clear: 34,000 beds needed to be available, but not necessarily filled. But DHS secretaries have interpreted the appropriations legislation differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2013 congressional hearing, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano <a href=\"http://www.micevhill.com/attachments/immigration_documents/hosted_documents/113th_congress/TranscriptOfHouseAppropriationsSubcommitteeHearingOnFY14DHSAppropriations.pdf\">hinted</a> that the detention bed quota was tying ICE&rsquo;s hands, saying that &quot;we ought to be managing the actual detention population to risk, not to an arbitrary number.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told us that bureaucracy is a driving force behind the increased detention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A plain reading of the statute would be that they (ICE) just need to have the beds available but not fill them. I think in practice, they have felt that they needed to fill them (because) they are being funded for those beds and they don&#39;t want to lose that funding.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Has the number always been increasing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez also stated that that number &quot;has only been increasing since 2009.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though we&rsquo;ve already established that no such numerical detainee requirement exists in the law for ICE, we decided to see if this part of Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s claim was correct by looking at how the language in the appropriations bills changed from year to year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that her claim was not accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DHS appropriations bills from 2010 to 2016 all included similar bed quotas. But the most recent <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ31/PLAW-115publ31.pdf\">2017</a> and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1625/BILLS-115hr1625enr.pdf\">2018</a> appropriations bills contained no such language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts confirmed with us that the detention bed quota language had been eliminated in 2017, and did not reappear in the current bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While ICE&rsquo;s average daily population has overall been <a href=\"https://www.immigrantjustice.org/staff/blog/immigration-detention-bed-quota-timeline\">on the rise</a> since 2009, to say that the number tied to the detention bed quota has risen, as Ocasio-Cortez did, is inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez claimed that &quot;ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The language in the congressional appropriations bills from 2009 through 2016 only mandates that ICE keep at least 33,400 (later 34,000) beds available. The bills don&rsquo;t state that those beds need to be filled. Under different DHS secretaries, the government&rsquo;s interpretation of the law has varied as to whether the beds need to be filled or not. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the last time the language requiring ICE to maintain a certain number of beds appeared in an appropriations bill was 2016. So, Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s claim that the &quot;number (of detainees ICE is required to detain) has only been increasing since 2009&quot; is inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s claim False. \u200b</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-05T16:20:31.238853", "ruling_date": "2018-07-06T09:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez misrepresents ICE\u2019s detention bed quota ", "ruling_headline_slug": "alexandria-ocasio-cortez-misrepresents-ices-detent", "ruling_link_text": "'Beds, not people' ", "ruling_state": "Illinois", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Intercept, &quot;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/06/27/an-interview-with-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-the-young-democratic-socialist-who-just-shocked-the-establishment/\">An Interview With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, The Young Democratic Socialist Who Just Shocked the Establishment,</a>&quot; June 27, 2018, 2:54 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Corbin Trent, Communications Director, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 2018, June 29-30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Immigration and Customs Enforcement press office, July 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews with Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation, National Immigrant Justice Center, July 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with David Bier, Immigration Policy Analyst, Cato Institute, July 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Denise Gilman, law professor and director of the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, July 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews with Peter Margulies, immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, July 2-3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, Director, Center for Immigrants&rsquo; Rights Clinic, Penn State Law, July 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Michelle Mittelstadt, Director of Communications and Public Affairs, Migration Policy Institute, July 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies, Center for Immigration Studies, July 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Immigrant Justice Center, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.immigrantjustice.org/eliminate-detention-bed-quota\">Detention Bed Quota,</a>&quot; Accessed July 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Immigrant Justice Center, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.immigrantjustice.org/sites/default/files/content-type/commentary-item/documents/2017-01/Immigration%20Detention%20Bed%20Quota%20Timeline%202017_01_05.pdf\">Immigration Detention Bed Quota Timeline,</a>&quot; January 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ83/pdf/PLAW-111publ83.pdf\">Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/s3607/text\">Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2011</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/112/plaws/publ74/PLAW-112publ74.pdf\">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ6/PLAW-113publ6.pdf\">Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013</a> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ76/PLAW-113publ76.pdf\">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ4/PLAW-114publ4.pdf\">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ113/PLAW-114publ113.pdf\">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ31/PLAW-115publ31.pdf\">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1625/BILLS-115hr1625enr.pdf\">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>C-SPAN, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499837/rep-labrador-bed-quota\">Rep.
