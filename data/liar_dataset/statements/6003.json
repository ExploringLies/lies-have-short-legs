Scott Walker was launched over how he eliminated a $3.6 billion budget shortfall -- in part by requiring greater health insurance and pension contributions from most public employees, and curtailing collective bargaining.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, in the days before the June 5, 2012 election, Democratic challenger Tom Barrett has focused on one of Walker&rsquo;s budget-balancing techniques.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the May 25, 2012 debate, Barrett claimed Walker had &quot;used the credit card&quot; to create a budget that the Walker administration says now shows a small surplus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You know how that budget surplus came about, if it is in fact there?&quot; Barrett asked. &quot;Because he used the credit card. He used the credit card, and pushed over $500 million in debt onto our children and our grandchildren.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett went on to say state taxpayers &quot;are going to have to pay more than $150 million in interest&quot; because of the move.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett was talking about a debt restructuring Walker and Republican legislators approved in 2011 for the 2011-13 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the immediate context of Barrett&rsquo;s remarks was Walker&rsquo;s announcement on May 10, 2012, that the short-term interest savings from that debt restructuring were higher than expected, helping him turn a small mid-budget deficit into a small projected surplus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost of the additional savings was from pushing off the debt repayment into the future; about 15 percent was from getting a lower interest rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s Department of Administration <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gop-leaders-challenge-barrett-t\">said it would likely </a>save an additional $78 million in the two years, and that <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gop-leaders-challenge-barrett-t\">helped knock down the projected deficit</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs backup for the claim, Barrett&rsquo;s campaign pointed to a memo prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the non-partisan state agency that keeps track of state finances. In the May 18 memo to Sen. Kathleen Vinehout (D-Alma) Fiscal Bureau analyst Al Runde wrote:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Therefore, in total, since May 2011, the state has issued additional debt to restructure, or make the principal payments on, approximately $558.3 million in GPR (general purpose revenue) supported principal that would have otherwise been paid off in 2010-11 and 2011-12.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As a result, that principal will now remain outstanding for a longer period of time and thus an estimated $156.2 million in additional interest costs could be incurred by the state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBob Lang, director of the Fiscal Bureau, said the payments would stretch out in the range of 20 years -- which goes to the &quot;children and grandchildren&quot; part of Barrett&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the Walker campaign to respond to Barrett&rsquo;s claim about borrowing. They sent a memo that made more than a dozen points -- mostly attacking Barrett -- but did not address the debt restructuring. Campaign spokesman Ciara Matthews referred more detailed questions to the governor&rsquo;s state spokesman, Cullen Werwie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWerwie said the administration decided the borrowing was better than other alternatives to balance the budget, including raising taxes or further spending cuts or &quot;some gimmick that would have delayed payments for Medicaid or school aids.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added: &quot;With &nbsp;the restructuring, we were able to finish FY11 in the black (with a slight surplus)&quot; and repay $58.7 million in payments to the &nbsp;Minnesota-Wisconsin reciprocity bill and $234 million owed to the Patients Compensation Fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett says Walker borrowed $500 million to help balance the state budget at a cost of $150 million in interest over 20 years. Those numbers are slightly lower than the Fiscal Bureau estimates, but, overall, on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut his calling it a &quot;credit card&quot; approach implies that this was an irresponsible action. No one&rsquo;s claiming that -- it&rsquo;s something the state did under Gov. Jim Doyle, and not unlike what many homeowners do when they refinance mortgages to better meet their budgets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, more favorable borrowing terms saved $78 million and helped Walker claim his budget is running a surplus rather than a deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Barrett&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(You can comment on this item on the<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-walker-barrett-claims-on-the-states-fiscal-health-bn5k127-155928435.html\"> Journal Sentinel&#39;s website</a>) </em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-30T18:32:21.914399", "ruling_date": "2012-05-31T09:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Barrett says Walker used a \"credit card\" approach to balance state budget, pushing borrowing costs into the future", "ruling_headline_slug": "barrett-says-walker-used-credit-card-approach-bala", "ruling_link_text": "Restructuring debt, yes; but more routine than implied", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceszgmSKQuA\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.7183617943626711\">Debate</a> between Scott Walker and Tom Barrett, May 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/154286625.html#%21page=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">&quot;Barrett-Walker debate: Taxes,&quot;</a> May 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gop-leaders-challenge-barrett-to-explain-his-budget-plan-8r5c82b-150952775.html\">&quot;Walker&rsquo;s team expects $154.5 million surplus by 2013,&quot;</a> May 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-faces-143-million-shortfall-as-tax-collections-lag-e844sbt-139047659.html\">&quot;State faces $143 million shortfall as tax collections lag,&quot;</a> Feb. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/releases/May12/0524/0524lfbgpr.pdf\">Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo</a> to Sen.
