Yes, at least as far back as poverty data has been calculated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a refresher on how poverty is calculated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html\">Census Bureau</a> &quot;uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family&#39;s total income is less than the family&#39;s threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the official poverty line is the same regardless of geography, they are updated yearly for inflation. Non-cash benefits, such as public housing, Medicaid, or food stamps, are not factored into the calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at Census Bureau data for the poverty status by race and Hispanic origin from 1966 to 2017. Here&rsquo;s the full run of that data:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, African-American poverty was 21.2 percent, which was below the previous record low of 21.8 percent the previous year, 2016. (Prior to 2002, data is available only for &quot;black&quot; Americans. After that year, data is available for &quot;black alone&quot; and &quot;black alone or in combination.&quot; We used the data for &quot;black alone or in combination&quot; for the period in which it is available.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, for Hispanics, the 2017 poverty rate was 18.3 percent, which edged out the previous record low of 19.4 percent in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>African-American poverty peaked at 41.8 percent in 1966. Hispanic poverty peaked at 30.7 percent in 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump didn&rsquo;t directly take credit for the decline in his Wheeling remarks, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the poverty rate had fallen for several years running under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. So the pattern stems from the generally improving economy under both presidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our Ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it&rsquo;s been incredible, they&rsquo;ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right that poverty rates hit their historical lows in 2017 since the statistic was first calculated consistently in 1966. We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-23T12:57:28.929803", "ruling_date": "2018-10-23T13:04:26", "ruling_headline": "Is African-American, Hispanic poverty at all-time low?", "ruling_headline_slug": "african-american-hispanic-poverty-all-time-low", "ruling_link_text": "Best since record-keeping began", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/income-poverty.html\">Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2017</a>,&quot; Sep. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/time-series/historical-poverty-people/hstpov2.xls\">historical poverty data</a>, accessed Oct. 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html\">How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 23, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it&rsquo;s been incredible, they&rsquo;ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a rally in Wheeling, W.Va.", "statement_date": "2018-09-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 130, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/130/", "subject": "Diversity", "subject_slug": "diversity", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 29, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/29/", "subject": "Poverty", "subject_slug": "poverty", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Is African-American, Hispanic poverty at all-time low?"}
