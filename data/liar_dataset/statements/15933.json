Cruz make his claim in the video above.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas fact-checked the claim that U-hauls from California to Texas are more expensive. In 2014, they found they cost <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/mar/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-correct-trucks-cost-half-much-rent-goin/\">twice as much </a>as ones headed in the reverse direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this fact check, we focused on Cruz&rsquo;s claim about California&rsquo;s population -- a statement brought to our attention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeffayWrit/status/1044345723968528385\">on Twitter</a> by applied demographer Jeffrey Wright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/photos/screen_shot_tweet_cruz_population.JPG\" style=\"height:617px; width:814px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We agreed with Wright that it was time for a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about the claim, Cruz&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed to several <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/27/california.dream.census.slump/index.html\">news</a> and <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265\">government</a> reports on Californians leaving for other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evidence for that is clear. We explored it in a <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/sep/06/john-cox/john-coxs-exaggerated-claim-half-people-want-leave/\">recent fact check</a> on Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox when he made an exaggerated claim that &quot;half the people&quot; in California want to leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reported that California&rsquo;s once-rapid <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-population/\">population growth</a> has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in from the rest of the country for many years, according to a <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265\">February 2018 study</a> by the California Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/\">American Community Survey</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s moving from and to California, according to the report:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states (Texas, Arizona, and Nevada). College-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California from its top feeder states (New York, Illinois, and New Jersey).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we also found the gap between the number of Californians who left for other states and those who arrived from the rest of the country has narrowed considerably. That gap was several hundred thousand people per year in the 1990s and mid 2000s, but dropped to a few thousand per year during the Great Recession, before again increasing. Still, that&rsquo;s hardly a &quot;hemorrhaging,&quot; especially considering this is only a subset of the state&rsquo;s overall population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rTpsveHs1HCds6eb2Xx-kcMXBsQihA3VYkGFPHQ-pZfBM1v5Fh47RNUB5BAI2s7hNRRZJmAmGX8bzmEal0wtSJRyvTx4qOfyVL5ElNti9n8pLJ1NuGT05zp4YkJqtE-Ub1EeFsI5\" style=\"height:445px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>SOURCE: Feburary 2018 <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265\">report,</a> California Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Overall population continues to grow</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The migration to other states does not mean California&rsquo;s overall population is in decline.
