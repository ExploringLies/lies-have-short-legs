More recently, Feingold has hit the theme harder.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;His idea for growing our economy is to give millionaires like himself more tax cuts,&quot; Feingold told supporters at an Oct. 18, 2010 rally the University of &nbsp;Wisconsin-Oshkosh.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He likes to say there are too many lawyers in the Senate &ndash; 57. He&rsquo;d be the 70th millionaire. I think they&rsquo;re a little over-represented.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs Feingold right on the fat-cat factor?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s not an easy question to answer, because senators are not required to disclose their true net worth. Under the required financial disclosure reports, they are allowed to list broad dollar-value ranges for assets and debts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs support for the claim, Feingold&rsquo;s campaign cites a widely quoted 2009 study by the <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, a nonpartisan research group. The group&rsquo;s work takes the 2008 asset and liability figures that senators reported and finds a mid-point to approximate net worth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe center&rsquo;s study found that 67 of 100 senators carry a net worth of greater than $1 million. Wisconsin&rsquo;s Herb Kohl, a Democrat, was the richest on the list at $214 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin updated the study to include three new senators -- Scott Brown of Massachusetts, &nbsp;George LeMieux of Florida and Carte Goodwin of West Virginia -- who were appointed or elected after the group&rsquo;s study came out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo of the newbies, LeMieux and Brown, have a net worth above the $1 million mark, based on our calculations using the center&rsquo;s methodology.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s the math the Feingold campaign used to get to Johnson as the 70th: 67 + 2 + Johnson = 70.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course that slots Johnson into the current crop of senators. If Johnson wins Nov. 2, he will likely be part of a different mix -- some incumbents are retiring or lost in primaries, others may lose on election day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow accurate are the numbers compared to senators&rsquo; true net worth?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you take Feingold as an example, the wealth estimates appear to be conservative.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFeingold takes the extra step of voluntarily disclosing his exact net worth through tax returns and a complete statement of net worth. The Journal Sentinel asks Wisconsin members of Congress for that information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2008 Feingold reported a net worth of $452,500 -- far above the $83,000 figure that ranked him one of &quot;10 poorest&quot; senators in the Center for Responsive Politics study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Johnson, based on the center&rsquo;s methodology and his 2010 disclosure form, Johnson&rsquo;s net worth would be $17.8 million. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat would put him in the top 15 wealthiest members of the current Senate, though for the others the 2008 figures are being used.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s review our math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn turning the tables on Johnson, Feingold says the problem isn&rsquo;t lawyers in the Senate, but millionaires. He pegs Johnson as the would-be 70th, though that would be in the current Senate -- not whatever mix is there after the election. By our calculations, and those of the Center for Responsive Politics, Feingold is accurate. If anything, the methodology underestimates a person&rsquo;s net worth -- and therefore may under-count the actual millionaires in the body.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-21T19:34:51.685077", "ruling_date": "2010-10-22T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Russ Feingold says Ron Johnson would become the 70th millionaire in the Senate if elected", "ruling_headline_slug": "russ-feingold-says-ron-johnson-would-become-70th-m", "ruling_link_text": "The post-election mix will be different, but there are 69 already", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCenter for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/overview.php?type=W&amp;year=2008&amp;filter=S\">Senate Net Worth report</a>, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Times, <a href=\"http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/your-senator-is-probably-a-millionaire/\">Your Senator Is (Probably) A Millionaire</a>, Nov. 25, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interviews, John Kraus, senior Feingold campaign strategist, Oct. 19-20<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRon Johnson, <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/34134379/Ron-Johnson-for-U-S-Senate-Financial-Disclosure-Report\">financial disclosure report</a>, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRuss Feingold, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?CID=N00000036\">financial disclosure reports</a>, 1995-2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Senator Scott Brown,<a href=\"http://www.brownforussenate.com/about\">website biography</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Senator Carte Goodwin,<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/senators/one_item_and_teasers/goodwin_carte.htm\">website biography</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Senator George LeMieux,<a href=\"http://lemieux.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Biography\">website biography</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/president/29529769.html\">Lawmaker from state are well-off</a>, June 22, 2008</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Russ ", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 528, "last_name": "Feingold", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "russ-feingold", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Russ_Feingold_Pfact_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/528/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.progressivesunited.org/about/russ-feingold"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Ron Johnson &quot;likes to say there are too many lawyers in the Senate &ndash; 57.
