Bush and director emeritus of the Center for First Amendment Studies at California State University, Long Beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith said Trump&rsquo;s tribute to the Navy SEAL was a &quot;moment unmatched since Reagan paid tribute to Lenny Skutnick, who actually was in the gallery. And that began the tradition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skutnik was a former Congressional Budget Office employee who <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/lenny-skutnik-sotu-interview-213522\">helped rescue a plane crash survivor</a> from the Potomac River in January 1982.

A more accurate headline would be, &quot;Top Democrats don&rsquo;t stand as long as Republicans for Gold Star widow.&quot; A video review shows Democrats including Sanders, Pelosi, Wasserman Schultz and Ellison stood.&nbsp; But most sat down while Republicans renewed their applause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To say they outright refused to stand up is inaccurate.
