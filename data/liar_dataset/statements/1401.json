This research has prompted us to revise downward our rating of Medina&rsquo;s claim to Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews and news articles confirm that Perry was among 28 Democratic legislators who endorsed Gore for president in January 1988. But there&rsquo;s no proof he led or ran Gore&rsquo;s campaign in Texas. It appears that a Democratic opponent slapped various Gore campaign leadership labels on Perry in a 1998 election year and, partly because Perry did not dispute them, the descriptives stuck.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor archival purposes, the article below retains the text of our original Medina fact check, which was published Jan. 16, 2010.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGOP gubernatorial hopeful Debra Medina, a Wharton businesswoman, started a question to Gov. Rick Perry during Thursday night&#39;s GOP gubernatorial debate by pointing out he hasn&#39;t always been a Republican.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMedina said: &quot;Governor, you were a Democrat, having worked for Al Gore as his campaign manager...&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Gore-y chapter of Perry&#39;s political life hasn&#39;t come up in a while.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe decided to explore Medina&#39;s two-part claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry didn&#39;t &mdash; and couldn&#39;t &mdash; dispute Medina&#39;s reminder that he was once a Democrat. Perry, whose father was repeatedly elected as a Democrat to the Haskell County Commission, won his first election, to the Texas House in 1984, as a Democrat. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 &mdash; a race that Perry won in an upset.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the debate, Perry didn&#39;t answer Medina&#39;s charge that he was Gore&#39;s campaign manager.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, according to news accounts and Perry&#39;s campaign, Perry served as Gore&#39;s Texas campaign chairman in 1988.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat brought Perry to pitch in for Gore, whose candidacy washed out after he failed to do well outside his native South?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to news reports at the time, many conservative Texas Democrats put stock in Gore&rsquo;s campaign, among them former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and then-House Speaker Gib Lewis, who flew to Washington to endorse Gore.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater, Perry said he found out Gore was far from a real conservative.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Going through that (Gore experience) was part of what started me through the process of changing parties in 1989,&quot; Perry said. &quot;I came to my senses.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the Texas primary, Gore ran third to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLate last year, Perry revisited his disagreement with Gore over man&rsquo;s impact on global warming. Suggesting he&#39;d seen the light on the climate issue while Gore had drifted into darker territory, Perry joked: &quot;I certainly got religion. I think he&#39;s gone to hell.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the two won&#39;t be launching any new joint ventures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Medina correctly nudged Perry about his Democratic roots. And she was close to right about his Gore connection, though a visitor from another planet might read her statement to mean Perry was improbably Gore&#39;s national campaign manager. Instead, he was Gore&#39;s Texas chairman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate her statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>This rating was changed to Half True on Sept. 7, 2011.</em></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-15T20:19:45.061527", "ruling_date": "2011-09-07T07:34:15", "ruling_headline": "Debra Medina claims Rick Perry was a Democrat and Al Gore's campaign manager", "ruling_headline_slug": "debra-medina-claims-rick-perry-was-democrat-and-al", "ruling_link_text": "CORRECTED: Perry was supporter, not chairman", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAustin American-Statesman, &quot;GOP Senate foes come out swinging,&quot; Jan. 5, 1988<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAustin American-Statesman, &quot;Briscoe, Hay backing Al Gore,&quot; p.
