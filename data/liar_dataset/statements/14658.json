We found that Pelosi&rsquo;s numbers are on target. But the suggestion that this deduction primarily helps lower-earning Americans misses the mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked with Pelosi&rsquo;s office, they cited <a href=\"https://www.gfoa.org/sites/default/files/GFOA_SALT_09202017.pdf\">data</a> from the Government Finance Officers Association. A table in the group&rsquo;s report does indeed say that 54 percent of households that claimed the deduction earned $100,000 or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s more a reflection of how many households earn $100,000 or less, rather than an indication that the state and local tax deduction is a targeted benefit for lower earners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lower-income taxpayers are less likely to itemize their tax returns and therefore less likely to benefit from the state and local tax deduction, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow and director of the state and local finance initiative at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. &quot;But because there are so many more taxpayers in these income groups, they make up a majority of taxpayers claiming it,&quot; Reuben said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Reuben indicated, higher-income households are much more likely to take the deduction than lower-income taxpayers are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is only part of the picture. Most other data shows the deduction skewing toward higher-income taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the same report Pelosi&rsquo;s office cited, between 91 percent and 93 percent of households earning $200,000 and up take the deduction. By contrast, 53 percent of taxpayers with between $75,000 and $100,000 in income used the deduction, and the lower income bands used it at rates significantly less than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary chart from the report:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the dollar amounts saved through deduction skew heavily toward&nbsp;the upper end of the income spectrum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if anything, removing the deduction will disproportionately hurt higher earners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the same report, households up to $100,000 in income accounted for about 23 percent of the dollar value of the deduction -- far from the majority implied by the statistic used in Pelosi&rsquo;s tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, almost 20 percent of the dollar amount saved from the deduction went to taxpayers with more than $1 million in income alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the benefits at the upper end of the income spectrum aren&rsquo;t just larger in an absolute sense, but they&rsquo;re also bigger as a percentage of the taxpayer&rsquo;s income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For income bands under $100,000, the amount saved from the state and local deduction ranged from 2 percent to 4 percent of adjusted gross income. But for taxpayers earning $200,000 and up, the percentage saved was 7 percent to 8 percent of adjusted gross income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the summary chart from the same report.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of this stems from the reality that a $1,000 deduction would be worth $396 to someone in the top 39.6 percent tax bracket, while the same $1,000 deduction would be worth $250 to someone in the 25 percent bracket, said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So not only do the wealthy claim more of the deduction, they get more value for the deductions they do claim,&quot; Newton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we presented this additional data to Pelosi&rsquo;s office, a spokesman said that Pelosi&rsquo;s tweets were intended to remind people that many moderate-income working families do benefit from the state and local deduction -- a reality often overlooked in the debate, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think you have to note that even the comparatively lower utilization rate in the lower brackets amounts to millions and millions of households losing a deduction that is a pretty big deal in terms of their family budget,&quot; said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesman. &quot;Often, that gets lost when you go to the aggregate number of deduction value.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi tweeted, &quot;50% of households that claim State &amp; Local Tax deduction make under $100K.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data says that 54 percent of taxpayers who claim the deduction make $100,000 or less. But, in reality, this is a tax deduction that disproportionately benefits higher-income taxpayers -- not the group Pelosi highlighted in her tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi&#39;s claim is accurate, but it comes with that caveat. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-10-20T10:01:34.833244", "ruling_date": "2017-10-20T17:20:19", "ruling_headline": "Do moderate-income families benefit more from the state and local tax deduction?", "ruling_headline_slug": "do-moderate-income-families-benefit-more-state-and", "ruling_link_text": "That's part of the story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Nancy Pelosi, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/918531606100545536\">tweet</a>, Oct. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government Finance Officers Association, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.gfoa.org/sites/default/files/GFOA_SALT_09202017.pdf\">The Impact of Eliminating the State and Local Tax Deduction: Updated with 2015 IRS Data</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-deduction-state-and-local-taxes-work\">Tax Policy Center Briefing Book: State (and Local) Taxes</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/baseline-distribution-income-and-federal-taxes-march-2017/t17-0002-baseline\">T17-0002 - Baseline Distribution of Income and Federal Taxes, by Expanded Cash Income Level, 2011 - 2027</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/baseline-distribution-income-and-federal-taxes-march-2017/t17-0002-baseline\">The State and Local Tax Deduction: A Primer</a>,&quot; March 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jared Walczak, senior policy analyst with the Center for State Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation, Oct. 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Patrick Newton, spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Oct. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kim Rueben, senior fellow and director of the state and local finance initiative at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, Oct. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Henry Connelly, spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, Oct. 19, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "House Minority Leader", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Nancy ", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "California", "id": 59, "last_name": "Pelosi", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "nancy-pelosi", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-nancypelosi.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/59/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The state and local tax deduction is a major benefit for moderate-income households because &quot;50% of households that claim State &amp; Local Tax deduction make under $100K.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2017-10-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Do moderate-income families benefit more from the state and local tax deduction?"}
