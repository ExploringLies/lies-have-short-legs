Harry Reid and other party powerhouses who get to independently decide which candidate to support. (Four currently support Clinton, one supports Sanders and three are neutral so far.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the remaining 35 delegates, 23 are so-called &quot;district-level delegates&quot; who are allocated based on <a href=\"https://nvcaucuses.com/\">February caucus results</a> in each of the state&rsquo;s four congressional districts. Clinton won 13 of those, while Sanders won 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining 12 are doled out during the state party convention in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of that 12, there are five pledged &quot;party leader and elected official&quot; delegates and seven &quot;at-large&quot; delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has a majority of supporters at the state convention will win the odd-numbered delegate from those groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll &mdash; smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus. Initial estimates from February had Clinton winning 20 delegates and Sanders taking 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that didn&rsquo;t happen at the Clark County (Las Vegas) convention in early April, as the Sanders campaign had 2,964 delegates show up compared to 2,386 for Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February, Clinton won a total of 4,889 delegates in Clark County but less than half of those showed up for the county convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accusations flew from both campaigns about questionable practices before, during and after the county convention, with the Sanders campaign claiming party officials tried to &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/716290819766943744\">depose a neutral official</a>,&quot; and Clinton surrogates like Nevada state director Michelle White upset with a &quot;number of irregularities&quot; in the convention process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving those accusations aside for the moment, the practical outcome is that Sanders now has a larger number of delegates (2,124) attending the state convention in May than Clinton (1,722).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means they&rsquo;ll be in a position to pick off a few of those remaining 12 convention delegates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the numbers, it&rsquo;s likely that Sanders will be able to flip delegates and go from a projected 20-15 deficit to a more narrow 18-17 delegate split. (This count doesn&rsquo;t factor in the superdelegates, who are also tilted toward Clinton.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Sanders, that&rsquo;s not &quot;winning&quot; Nevada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Longtime Nevada political journalist <a href=\"https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sanders-likely-flips-two-delegates-after-dominating-clark-convention\">Jon Ralston</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/05/will-matter-sanders-won-nv-county-conventions/82648052/\">Associated Press</a> reported in the immediate aftermath of the county convention that the likely final result remains a Clinton victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Clinton&rsquo;s widely expected to keep her Nevada win except in the unlikely event of a Sanders blowout at the state level or if Clinton-backing superdelegates defect to the Sanders camp,&quot; the AP reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several reports claimed that Bernie Sanders retroactively won Nevada&rsquo;s presidential caucuses, based on higher-than-expected turnout at a major county convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders likely swung two delegates his way after the county convention, but we won&rsquo;t know for sure until the state convention selects the delegates in May. Either way, Clinton still holds a narrow delegate lead, projections show. That lead is larger if you include the support of Nevada&rsquo;s so-called &quot;super-delegates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-07T15:36:27.116773", "ruling_date": "2016-04-07T15:56:40", "ruling_headline": "No, Bernie Sanders didn't retroactively win Nevada", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-bernie-sanders-didnt-retroactively-win-nevada", "ruling_link_text": "Narrower, but still a Clinton win", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Michelle White, Hillary for Nevada state director, April 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/05/will-matter-sanders-won-nv-county-conventions/82648052/\">Will it matter that Sanders won NV county conventions?</a>,&quot; April 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Uncut, &quot;<a href=\"http://usuncut.com/politics/bernie-wins-nevada-democratic-caucus/\">Bernie Sanders Wins the Nevada Caucus After Al</a>l,&quot; April 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occupy White House, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.occupywhitehouse.org/2016/04/bernie-sanders-projected-winner-of.html\">Bernie Sanders Projected Winner of Nevada Caucus 19-16</a>,&quot; April 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia Today, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.rt.com/usa/338263-bernie-sanders-wins-nevada/#.VwKxiMz4c7Q.twitter\">Bernie Sanders set to win Nevada after delegates switch</a>,&quot; April 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ralston Reports, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sanders-likely-flips-two-delegates-after-dominating-clark-convention\">Sanders likely flips two delegates after dominating Clark convention</a>,&quot; April 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ralston Reports, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/bernie-vs-hillary-boils-over-nevada-clark-convention\">Bernie vs. Hillary boils over in Nevada before Clark convention</a>,&quot; April 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Las Vegas Sun, &quot;<a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/apr/02/sanders-wins-most-delegates-at-clark-county-conven/\">Sanders wins most delegates at Clark County convention</a>,&quot; April 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reddit, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4d3w8t/bernie_wins_nevada/\">BERNIE WINS NEVADA</a>,&quot; April 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/716290819766943744\">Bernie Sanders</a>, April 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NV Dems, &quot;<a href=\"http://nvdems.com/press/caucus-memo-overview-of-delegate-counts-for-nevadas-first-in-the-west-democratic-presidential-caucus/\">CAUCUS MEMO: OVERVIEW OF DELEGATE COUNTS FOR NEVADA&rsquo;S FIRST IN THE WEST DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUS</a>,&quot; Nov. 18, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "", "false_count": 82, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 280, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 416, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Say Bernie Sanders &quot;won Nevada after all.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "several blog and social media posts", "statement_date": "2016-04-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
