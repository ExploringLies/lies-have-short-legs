The Republican presidential nominee did so again during a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?417557-1/donald-trump-campaigns-springfield-ohio&amp;start=3123\">rally</a> in Springfield, Ohio, on Oct. 27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that the poverty rate for young African-Americans is disproportionately high, but not nearly as high as Trump suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article, we suspect that he came across the statistic in a <a href=\"http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/fact-sheets/poverty/\">&quot;State of Working America&quot; report</a> published by the liberal Economic Policy Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An infographic packaged with the report said, &quot;45.8 percent of young black children (under age 6) live in poverty, compared to 14.5 percent of white children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that were a current statistic, Trump would be on pretty solid ground. But it&rsquo;s not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious from the infographic, but the State of Working America report was published in 2012. And the data itself is now six years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full text of the report says, &quot;In 2010, close to half (45.8 percent) of young black children (under age 6) were in poverty, compared with 14.5 percent of white children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that 2010 was during and just after the Great Recession, so poverty rates were unusually high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out what the rates are now, we turned to <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-pov/pov-01.html\">data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. The most recent data we found is for children under age 5 and covers 2015. That&rsquo;s slightly different, but Census data <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/pov-34/2016/pov34_100_6.xls\">specific to poverty levels among children age six</a> do not change the percentage significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For African-Americans under five, the poverty rate was <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/pov-01/2016/pov01_100_6.xls\">37.4 percent</a>. That&rsquo;s quite a bit lower than the &quot;almost half&quot; of African-American children that Trump cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage falls even further if you give weight to Trump&rsquo;s use of the term &quot;abject poverty&quot; and look at the poorest of the poor -- those with incomes at half of the poverty level or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For African-Americans under 5, that half-of-poverty rate is <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/pov-01/2016/pov01_50_6.xls\">20.4 percent</a>. That&rsquo;s even further from &quot;almost half.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that compared to other racial and ethnic groups, the poverty levels for African-Americans are indeed high.
