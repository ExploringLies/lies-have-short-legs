If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Readers asked us to check if the propositions won&rsquo;t raise their taxes and also whether property taxes are frozen for homeowners 65 or older. We put the mailer&rsquo;s claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;freeze&quot; claim is inaccurate, Travis County officials quickly said to our inquiries, and it&rsquo;s inaccurate to say the propositions won&rsquo;t cost taxpayers anything extra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, who <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/local-govt--politics/travis-county-commissioners-authorize-november-bond-election/ndsvaaQEz8YDr4ZgSMizVJ/\">voted with colleagues to place the two bond propositions on the ballot</a> before helping to kick off the <a href=\"https://www2.traviscountytx.gov/county_clerk/election/finance/9125.pdf\">privately funded</a> Travis Forward campaign, speculated that consultants behind the mailer assumed the county, like the Austin school district, provides tax freezes to homesteading homeowners 65 or older.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No doubt, this is inaccurate,&quot; Eckhardt said by phone. &quot;To the extent I am responsible, I fall on my sword.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone to our inquiry, Marya Crigler, chief appraiser of the <a href=\"https://www.traviscad.org/\">Travis Central Appraisal District</a>, noted that by state law, every Texas school district must set a ceiling on how much homeowners 65 or older pay. Counties and other governmental jurisdictions have the local option of setting such ceilings, Crigler advised. See TCAD&rsquo;s breakdown of exemptions and tax ceilings offered by Travis County jurisdictions <a href=\"https://www.traviscad.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cad3773_b2_entity_addr_exemption_report_code_order_171010.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eckhardt helped us reach Mykle Tomlinson, Travis Forward&rsquo;s campaign manager, who said by phone the errors occurred in mailers targeting older residents because consultants whom he did not identify misunderstood the difference between a homestead tax exemption and a tax freeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After our inquiry, Tomlinson said the group would follow up by sending postcards within a day or so to the 12,295 households that received the mailer, which went out about the day the <a href=\"https://www.votetravis.com/vexpress/display.do\">early-voting period began</a> Oct. 23, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At our request, Tomlinson emailed us a copy of <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGZTA0Mm96bXFyWWs/view?usp=sharing\">the follow-up postcard</a> which says on its front: &quot;We were wrong and we&rsquo;re sorry!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The back of the postcard is headlined: &quot;Setting the record straight.&quot; Next comes text saying: &quot;The mailer we sent to your home last week wrongly claimed that, like school district taxes, senior homeowners&rsquo; county taxes are frozen under state law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The back also says: &quot;State law does not require a county tax freeze for seniors. The mailer we sent to your home last week was inaccurate, and we&rsquo;re sorry. Please help us set the record straight by sharing this with your friends and neighbors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruce Elfant, Travis County&rsquo;s tax assessor-collector, told us by phone that if the county propositions win approval, older homeowners will pay more in county taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the county, the owner of a home at the 2017 average taxable property value of $305,000 can expect to pay no more than $24 a year for 20 years <a href=\"https://www.traviscountytx.gov/images/tnr/bond/project_list_approved_by_court_as_of_08-08-17.pdf\">should voters approve</a> Proposition A, to spend $93.4 million on road, sidewalk, bike and other transportation-related projects, and Proposition B, devoting nearly $91.5 million to parks and land conservation projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.traviscountytx.gov/2017-bond-calculator\">county web page</a> enables anyone to input any taxable property value--for homeowners, meaning the value, less exemptions including the county&rsquo;s 20 percent homestead exemption--and see what the county estimates as the proposed bonds&rsquo; future annual costs to the property owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the county has no tax freeze for older residents, it does give them an additional homestead exemption up to $80,000 on the assessed value of their home. That is, county taxes accrue&nbsp;on the property&rsquo;s taxable&nbsp;assessed value above $80,000 for those 65 and older.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travis Forward said in a mailer: &quot;The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither claim holds up, we found, in that the propositions pose future tax costs for property owners with specific projected amounts driven by&nbsp;the assessed value of properties and&nbsp;the county doesn&rsquo;t freeze taxes for homeowners 65 or older. Rather, such a resident qualifies&nbsp;to exempt&nbsp;$80,000 of the taxable assessed value of their home from county taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this two-part to-be-retracted&nbsp;claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>FALSE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is not accurate.
