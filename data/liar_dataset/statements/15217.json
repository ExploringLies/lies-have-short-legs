MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when we contacted Officer Scott C. Earhardt, he said that he had mistakenly mixed up the annual D.C.-based March for Life&nbsp;rally that happened in January with the more recent March for Our Lives&nbsp;demonstration in the email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earhardt told PolitiFact that the story is not factual and that the permit for March for Our Lives&nbsp;was issued on March 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The misunderstanding between the two parties is likely to have increased confusion about the actual dates of when the permit was issued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The screenshot of the email pictured in the article was credited to <a href=\"http://jamesfetzer.blogspot.com\">James Fetzer</a>, a philosophy of science professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth who has promoted various conspiracy theories, including denying the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, the Boston Marathon bombing and the Holocaust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>March for Our Lives&nbsp;was <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/who-organized-the-march-for-our-lives-the-parkland-survivors-are-leading-the-way-8521755\">organized</a> by the Parkland student survivors who began the Never Again movement to promote gun control.
