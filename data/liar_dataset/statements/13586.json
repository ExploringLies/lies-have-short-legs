Yes, you read that right.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The op-ed is headlined: &quot;California Democrats legalize child prostitution.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>UPDATE: Allen repeated his claim on The O&#39;Reilly Factor on Fox News on Jan. 4, 2017, saying at the end of his interview that &quot;The California Democrats did just legalize child prostitution in California.&quot; </em></p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.capradio.org/articles/2017/01/05/billoreilly/\" width=\"500\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law <a href=\"http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_1301-1350/sb_1322_bill_20160926_chaptered.pdf\">Senate Bill 1322</a>. It decriminalizes prostitution for minors by preventing law enforcement from arresting people under 18 for soliciting sex or loitering with intent to commit prostitution. Supporters of the law said it&rsquo;s designed to treat children involved in prostitution as victims rather than as criminals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does nothing, however, to legalize commercial sex acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People caught having sex with minors, soliciting sex with minors or arranging clients for them can still be charged with crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The key is that the children involved are not liable, not that the conduct has been legalized,&quot; said <a href=\"https://law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/chin/\">Gabriel Chin</a>, a criminal law professor at UC Davis School of Law, who analyzed the law upon our request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chin added that under the new law &quot;child prostitution is treated just as, say, the production of child pornography is.&quot; Adults involved are subject to criminal prosecution, while the children, who are seen as victims, are not, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives for Allen did not respond to our questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allen, who represents Orange County, <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/87908\">told KQED public radio</a> he rejects the criticism he&rsquo;s received over the column.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t care about any amount of legalistic spin that someone wants to put on it. When you decriminalize something, you legalize it,&quot; Allen said in the radio interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his initial claim in the op-ed that &quot;prostitution by minors will be legal,&quot; Allen adds some factual context in his second line by noting law enforcement can&rsquo;t &quot;arrest&quot; underage workers for soliciting sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few paragraphs later, however, he wrongly asserts that the new law means law enforcement can&rsquo;t &quot;interfere&quot; with minors engaging in prostitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law, in fact, includes provisions that officers who encounter these minors shall report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. It also authorizes officers to take a minor engaged in a commercial sex act into temporary custody under some circumstances, including in the event of immediate physical danger or when medical care is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bill&rsquo;s author responds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic state Sen. Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles, who authored Senate Bill 1322, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HollyJMitchell\">responded on Twitter</a> to the mischaracterizations of the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I denounce false claims made by Republicans on my bill<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SB1322?src=hash\"> #SB1322</a> that decriminalizes sexually exploited minors,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I proudly authored SB 1322 to protect minor victims of human sex trafficking from being further charged as criminals for commercial sexual exploitation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This notion, perpetuated by Assemblymember Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach), that my bill legalizes prostitution and commercial sex for minors is categorically untrue,&quot; she added. &quot;It remains unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to consent to sexual intercourse in the State of California and the law remains in effect and is not changed with the implementation of my bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/8173561/Holly%20Mitchell%20twitter%20capture.JPG\" style=\"height:675px; width:657px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>California state Sen.

Instead, officers will have the option of taking them into temporary custody if they are in immediate danger or need medical attention.
