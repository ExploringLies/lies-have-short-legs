But the point total claim raised the hackles of one of our sports gurus, who said the Senate had made a rookie mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When another reader started raising questions about the Senate resolution on Twitter, we went to <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?seasonType=REG&amp;offensiveStatisticCategory=GAME_STATS&amp;d-447263-n=1&amp;d-447263-o=2&amp;d-447263-p=1&amp;d-447263-s=TOTAL_POINTS_SCORED&amp;tabSeq=2&amp;season=2013&amp;role=TM&amp;Submit=Go&amp;archive=false&amp;conference=null&amp;defensiveStatisticCategory=null&amp;qualified=false\"><u>the official statistics page</u></a> at NFL.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the site, New England scored 444 points during the regular season. That put the team in <em>third</em> place, one point behind the Chicago Bears (with 445 points) and the Broncos (with a whopping 606).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third place isn&#39;t second place, so the claim seems to be False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the resolution doesn&#39;t specify regular season. If you include postseason play, which purists are loath to do when comparing all the teams in the NFL, New England does rank second. (The Bears didn&#39;t make the playoffs.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By that measure, the resolution is correct. Denver has logged 630 points, New England 487 points, and Kansas City 474 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(If you want to look at the postseason alone, New England ranks fifth out of 12 teams on point totals. San Francisco and San Diego have scored more points, but each team has played two games, while the Patriots have played just one.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sum, the claim <em>can</em> be accurate, but only if you combine regular-season and postseason play, which means comparing teams that competed in 16 games with those that have played 17 games (or in a few cases, 18 games). That&#39;s a sizable caveat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the statement needs clarification or additional information to be correct, we rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(With research by Michael McDermott, sports editor of The Providence Journal.
