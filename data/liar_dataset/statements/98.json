Fred Thompson combined his folksy charm (the truck) with a set of conservative principles (less government, lower taxes, more free markets) to win election to the U.S. Senate in 1994.\n<p>\n And, indeed, in February of that year Thompson trailed Democrat Jim Cooper by 19 points &mdash; 36 to 17 percent &mdash; according to polling at the time by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thompson went on to win the race, which was a special election to complete the term of Al Gore who became vice president, with 60 percent of the vote to Cooper's 39 percent (a 21 percentage-point spread). Thompson won re-election to a full term two years later, defeating Democrat Houston Gordon, 61 to 37 percent.\n</p>\n<p>\n The truck played a role for the lobbyist and actor. He leased it to campaign in the state, building his down-home bona fides among voters.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the same speech Thompson also pointed out, correctly, that President Bill Clinton won Tennessee twice. But it's worth noting that Thompson's first victory, 1994, came in a tidal wave year for Republicans, who took control of Congress.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"That was kind of a watershed year in Tennessee,\" said Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:36.305854", "ruling_date": "2007-10-02T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Driving his truck to victory", "ruling_headline_slug": "driving-his-truck-to-victory", "ruling_link_text": "Driving his truck to victory", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Transcript, Thompson speech to National Rifle Association, cq.com, Sept. 21, 2007\n<p>\n Almanac of American Politics, 1998 edition\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/34992/\">\n  \"The Actor,\" New York magazine, July 30, 2007\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Survey analysis, Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, 1994\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview, Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, Sept. 26, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Actor", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Fred", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Tennessee", "id": 20, "last_name": "Thompson", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "fred-thompson", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-fredthompson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/20/", "total_count": 16, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.imwithfred.com/"}, "statement": "\"With those first principles, it allowed a fellow like me to get in his truck and go from one end of the state to the other; started 20 points down and wound up 20 points ahead on election night.\"", "statement_context": "Washington, D.C.", "statement_date": "2007-09-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
