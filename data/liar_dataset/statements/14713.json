Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&#39;s this&nbsp;about?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats in the Erie County Legislature have not introduced legislation that would make Erie County a sanctuary county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Neither the county executive nor any Democratic legislator ever introduced any legislation calling for Erie County to be a sanctuary county,&quot; said Peter Anderson, a spokesman for Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any legislation introduced by any legislator -- liberal or not -- that would designate Erie County as a sanctuary county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson for the New York Republican State Committee said the mailer refers to legislation introduced by Republican Legislator Ted Morton in December 2016. Morton&rsquo;s resolution would have reaffirmed Erie County as a non-sanctuary county. It would not have changed any law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Morton&rsquo;s resolution didn&rsquo;t even make it to a vote in committee.&nbsp;Republican Legislator Kevin Hardwick, the chairman of the Legislature&#39;s Government Affairs Committee, told <a href=\"http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2016/12/erie-county-anti-sanctuary-community-resolution-stalls-in-committee/\">Spectrum News</a> at the time that he didn&rsquo;t think the issue was &quot;a huge pressing problem in Erie County.&quot; So the resolution was tabled and never brought up again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Democratic legislator, Patrick Burke, opposed the resolution because he thought Morton was creating a false narrative about undocumented immigrants in Erie County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke may have opposed Morton&rsquo;s bill, but he did not publicly advocate for Erie County to become a sanctuary county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mailer from the New York Republican State Committee said &quot;liberals in County Hall want our community to be a sanctuary county.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that&rsquo;s true.
