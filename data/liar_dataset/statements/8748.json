Those younger retirees will receive annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to their pensions that are 1 percent lower than the rate of inflation (full COLAs will continue to be given to &nbsp;military retirees who are over 62).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In defending the move, Ryan made a claim about military pensions that we want to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Civilian public employees have a 401(k) with the match, a defined-benefit pension and health care. They don&#39;t have (pension) COLAs at all if they retire before the age of 62. And they do contribute some to their pensions, and now we&#39;re having (newly hired employees) contribute more,&quot; the Janesville Republican told the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> editorial board Dec. 19, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The military doesn&#39;t contribute toward their pension. They don&#39;t have a paycheck &ndash; payroll deduction -- toward their pensions. And they do have a COLA before they&#39;re 62.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more public employees -- notably state and local government workers <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/09/scott-walker/most-public-employees-wisconsin-now-pay-12-13-thei/\"><u>in Wisconsin</u></a> -- contributing more toward the cost of their benefits, we wondered if Ryan was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do members of the military contribute nothing toward their pensions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evolution of military pensions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Military pensions have expanded in scope since the <a href=\"http://people.cas.sc.edu/finocchi/Pensions%20v.1.5.pdf\"><u>first national pension law</u></a> was passed in 1776, in the early stages of the Revolutionary War. At that time, pensions were strictly for those <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofmilitar00glasrich/historyofmilitar00glasrich_djvu.txt\"><u>&quot;losing a limb</u></a> in any engagement, or being so disabled in the service of the United States as to render him incapable of earning a livelihood.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next several decades, pensions were awarded to Revolutionary War veterans <a href=\"http://actuary.defense.gov/Portals/15/Documents/valbook2007.pdf\"><u>based on need</u></a> and later they became <a href=\"http://actuary.defense.gov/Portals/15/Documents/valbook2007.pdf\"><u>full pay for life</u></a>, regardless of need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1948, <a href=\"http://actuary.defense.gov/Portals/15/Documents/valbook2007.pdf\"><u>20 years</u></a> was established as the minimum requirement for voluntary retirement for the Army and Air Force, putting those services on par with the Navy. Since 1986, military pensions have been <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42087.pdf\"><u>&quot;inflation protected,&quot;</u></a> with annual cost-of-living adjustments tied to the Consumer Price Index.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://actuary.defense.gov/Portals/15/Documents/statbook12.pdf\"><u>military retirement system</u></a> now provides some <a href=\"http://actuary.defense.gov/Portals/15/Documents/statbook12.pdf\"><u>$52 billion</u></a> per year in pension payments to more than <a href=\"http://actuary.defense.gov/Portals/15/Documents/statbook12.pdf\"><u>2 million</u></a> military retirees and their survivors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(By the way, pensions for civilian federal employees were created in 1920. Social Security was created in 1935.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42087.pdf\"><u>individual level</u></a>, members of the military are guaranteed a specific monthly pension payment after 20 or more years of service. However, it is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition: Those who serve at least 20 years are fully vested, but those who leave the military earlier usually receive no retirement benefits. Only <a href=\"http://dbb.defense.gov/Portals/35/Documents/Reports/2011/FY11-5_Modernizing_The_Military_Retirement_System_2011-7.pdf\"><u>17 percent</u></a> of those who serve in the military end up getting a retirement benefit, <a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=364048\"><u>according</u></a> to the Defense Business Board and the House Budget Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, as Ryan indicated in his comments, military retirees begin receiving their monthly pension payments immediately, regardless of age. So, many begin drawing military pensions in their early to mid-40s, often while working in another career. Other public-sector employees, and those in the private sector, typically do not begin receiving an annuity until age 55, 60, or 65.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pension contributions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what about contributions toward pensions? In other words, where does the money for the military retirement checks come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/11-14-12-MilitaryComp_0.pdf\"><u>report</u></a> and a Department of Defense <a href=\"http://actuary.defense.gov/Portals/15/Documents/statbook12.pdf\"><u>report</u></a> cited by Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert say members of the military make no contribution toward their pensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So does a <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42087.pdf\"><u>report</u></a> we found from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. And, <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholar/andrew-g-biggs/\"><u>Andrew Biggs</u></a>, a public employee retirement expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That contrasts with all other federal employees (including civilian employees in the military). They contribute a portion of their pay toward pensions; the rates mainly depend on when they were hired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of pension contributions, according to data we collected from the Congressional Research Service, the federal Office of Personnel Management and the <a href=\"http://www.narfe.org/departments/home/index.cfm\"><u>National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association</u></a>, which advocates for pay and benefits for federal employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Type of federal employee</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Percentage of pay contributed by employee </strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Percentage of pay contributed by employer </strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Military personnel</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>41.8</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Civilian, hired before 1984*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>7</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>19**</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Civilian, hired 1984-2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>0.8</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>11.9</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Civilian, hired in 2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>3.1</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>9.6</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Civilian, hired in 2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>4.4</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>9.6</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>*Generally do not pay into or receive Social Security; employees hired after 1984 pay 6.2% toward Social Security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>**An aggregate figure.
