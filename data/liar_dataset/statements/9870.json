Scott Brown -- now running to return to the Senate -- hasn&rsquo;t officially made it through the Republican primary yet, but he&rsquo;s long been considered the frontrunner to take on incumbent U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., in November&rsquo;s general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown has been the subject of numerous attack ads by outside groups, including a recent ad by the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic-aligned group, that claimed that he voted to give oil companies huge tax breaks and, in exchange, took more than $400,000 in campaign contributions. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitFact New Hampshire</u></a> rated the claim in that ad <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/may/01/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-says-scott-brown-got-400k-big-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True</u></a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Brown finds himself the target of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mroNmJWvr8&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>similar ad,</u></a> this time directly from the Shaheen campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The big oil companies are the most profitable on the planet,&quot; a narrator says at the beginning of the 30-second ad titled &quot;Profitable.&quot; &quot;Scott Brown voted to give them more than $20 billion in taxpayer subsidies. Big Oil gave Scott Brown thousands of dollars within days of his votes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a visual in the ad puts a number on those &quot;thousands of dollars&quot; that Brown received: &quot;Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,&quot; the ad declares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This seemed like something PolitiFact should sort out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we&rsquo;ve already fact-checked <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/apr/30/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-says-scott-brown-voted-give-oi/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Brown&rsquo;s &quot;big oil&quot; votes</u></a>, we&rsquo;ll focus here on the breakdown of contributions to his campaign and the specific number cited in Shaheen&rsquo;s ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shaheen campaign pointed us to OpenSecrets.org, an independent website run by the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks money in politics. The site tracks donations of at least $200 in congressional and other elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time Shaheen&rsquo;s ad first aired, OpenSecrets&rsquo; website showed <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00031174&amp;type=I\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$454,260</u></a> in campaign contributions from oil- and gas-industry donors for Brown over the course of his career. That was precisely the number cited by Shaheen. By now, that&rsquo;s actually a little out of date; updated figures show Brown has received $488,010 from donors associated with the oil and gas industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total makes the oil and gas industry the 14th most popular sector giving &nbsp;to Brown. The biggest sectors Brown receives money from are retired individuals, securities and investment, lawyers and law firms, and real estate, each of which account for at least $1 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But these numbers don&rsquo;t tell the whole story. Calling Brown&rsquo;s donors &quot;Big Oil&quot; isn&rsquo;t entirely accurate, since many such donors are not huge corporations or high-powered CEOs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets defines <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/background.php?cycle=2014&amp;ind=E01\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>oil and gas companies</u></a> as &quot;multinational and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline service stations and fuel oil dealers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while this category includes what would widely be understood as &quot;big oil,&quot; it also includes smaller, independent companies, as well as low-level individuals who happen to work for an oil company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, a breakdown of the contributions made to Brown from the oil and gas industry shows that only $52,550 of the total came from &quot;major multinational oil and gas producers.&quot; That&rsquo;s just 11.5 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One other quibble: The ad makes it sound like the companies themselves are donating, but that&rsquo;s true only for a minority of the dollars donated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, $168,000 came from political action committees, which pool employee dollars and make donations in the employer&rsquo;s name. The other $287,760 came from individuals associated with oil and gas companies. The reasons for an individual&rsquo;s donation may have everything or nothing to do with the industry&rsquo;s policy agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaheen&rsquo;s ad said that &quot;Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260.&quot; Independently collected data shows that while Brown received roughly that much from donors categorized under the &quot;oil and gas industry,&quot; only about 11.5 percent of that haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider &quot;Big Oil.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. So we rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-05T17:45:15.893299", "ruling_date": "2014-09-05T17:40:27", "ruling_headline": "Jeanne Shaheen says 'Big Oil' gave Scott Brown $454,260", "ruling_headline_slug": "jeanne-shaheen-says-big-oil-gave-scott-brown-45426", "ruling_link_text": "Not all from Big Oil", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jeanne Shaheen ad, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mroNmJWvr8&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Profitable</u></a>,&quot; August 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WMUR, <a href=\"http://www.wmur.com/politics/shaheen-campaign-targets-brown/27779102#!bMnOES\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Shaheen campaign targets Brown</u></a>, August 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsmax, <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Brown-Shaheen-oil-hypocrisy/2014/08/29/id/591643/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Shaheen Ad Linking Brown to &#39;Big Oil&#39; Blasted for Hypocrisy</u></a>, August 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2014/may/01/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-says-scott-brown-got-400k-big-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate Majority PAC says Scott Brown got $400K in &#39;big oil&#39; contributions</u></a>, May 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Colin Reed, Scott Brown campaign spokesman, April 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Doug Weber, Center for Responsive Politics, April 30, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Ty Matsdorf, Senate Majority PAC spokesman, April 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=E01\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Oil &amp; gas</u></a>,&quot; accessed April 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00031174&amp;type=I\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sen.
