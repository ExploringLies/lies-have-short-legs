Sherrod Brown has a challenge on his hands this November. &nbsp;How serious depends upon how one reads the polls and regards the money being spent against him by third-party groups.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown is an incumbent Democrat. His Republican challenger, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, says things are definitely looking bad for Brown and cites <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012-archive.html\">a survey from a Democratic pollster</a> as proof.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel, in a fund-raising pitch sent by email on July 9, used the number 38 to make his case. The number represents &quot;the number of years Sherrod Brown has been a career politician,&quot; Mandel said. But &quot;38 is also Sherrod Brown&rsquo;s approval rating in a recent poll conducted by a Democratic polling firm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yes, you read that correctly,&quot; Mandel continued. &quot;His approval rating has plummeted to 38 percent among Ohio voters, and down to 33 percent among Independent voters!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat decline caught PolitiFact Ohio&rsquo;s attention. Has Brown&rsquo;s standing among voters dropped precipitously?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel&rsquo;s campaign communications director, Travis Considine, pointed us to the poll his boss had mentioned. <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_GovSen_OH_062712.pdf\">Published on June 27, the poll</a> was conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Raleigh, N.C., firm that represents Democratic candidates but that also conducts polling for general consumption. We turned to that poll, and to other surveys from PPP, as it is known.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA news release accompanying the latest PPP poll actually had a headline quite different from Mandel&rsquo;s point. The headline said, &quot;Sen. Brown holds steady, Kasich already in trouble.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first paragraph in the news release announcing the results said, &quot;Despite steady increases in name recognition for Republican challenger Josh Mandel, incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown continues to hold onto a modest lead in his first re-election bid.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this automated telephone poll, conducted June 21 to June 24, Brown led Mandel by 7 percentage points. This meant &nbsp;that Brown&rsquo;s lead had dropped by only 1 point in a month despite ads from the Mandel campaign and groups that support him. Furthermore, PPP reported, &quot;Independents support Brown over Mandel 43-34.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s more, most of it supporting Brown. &quot;Sherrod Brown continues to lead the contest by a healthy margin,&quot; the PPP release concluded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWait a minute. Didn&rsquo;t Mandel&rsquo;s fund-raising email suggest otherwise?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRead the language closely. Mandel did not pick a number reflecting how voters would have decided if the vote had been in late June. Those are the so-called horse race numbers we mentioned above that are important for getting a sense of where the race stands at any given time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in the PPP poll, 15 percent of Ohio voters were still undecided.This is why other poll questions mattered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor instance, what do voters think of the job Brown is doing in the Senate? Those job-approval ratings can be important because they suggest potential weakness or strength as the campaign season continues. Mandel&rsquo;s would not be the first campaign to look for an opponent&rsquo;s weakness, spotlight it and then try to close the sale by offering voters an alternative.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThus, the PPP poll question Mandel cited: &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of Senator Sherrod Brown&rsquo;s job performance?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe answer, from a sample of 673 Ohioans who voted in at least one of the last three general elections (2006, 2008 and 2010):<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t38 percent approve.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t42 percent disapprove.</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t18 percent are not sure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGiven the poll&rsquo;s 3.8 percentage-point margin of error, that difference between approval and disapproval is small -- perhaps inconsequential. But Mandel focused on other points, too.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe looked at changes in Brown&rsquo;s approval ratings since January. To better understand, we ran out the numbers from a series of PPP polls. Consider:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown had a 42 percent job approval rating in a PPP poll conducted Jan. 28 and 29. His disapproval rating was 34. By early May, his approval had dropped by 2 points, still inside the margin of error, while his disapproval rating rose by a mere single digit. &nbsp;No noteworthy changes, in other words.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen came the latest PPP poll. It coincided with an advertising push by Mandel as well as that of outside business and conservative groups that have spent more than $10 million in hopes of ousting Brown.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe latest PPP poll put Brown&rsquo;s approval rating at 38 percent. His disapproval had grown to 42 percent,<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPut those together -- the 4-point drop in approval and the 8-point rise in disapproval since January -- and it means that Brown&rsquo;s approval ratings &quot;have suffered a net loss of 12 points,&quot; Considine told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it fair to put those numbers together to get to a 12-point loss?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPPP director Tom Jensen told us yes. &quot;That&rsquo;s how we would usually do it,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s important to note that this is only one poll. We looked at the trend for Brown&rsquo;s job approval this year in polls by Quinnipiac University, and unlike PPP, Quinnipiac showed a barely perceptible change of a single digit in each direction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Mandel was specific. He clearly referred to &quot;a recent poll conducted by a Democratic polling firm.&quot; So there was a drop. And it&rsquo;s fair to consider it a 12-point drop on net, says the pollster.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings us to a final point of consideration: Has Brown&rsquo;s approval rating &quot;plummeted,&quot; as Mandel said?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t describe it as a plummet,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Both Brown&rsquo;s and Mandel&rsquo;s numbers have gotten worse&quot; as the two go after one another.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKarlyn Bowman, an impartial polling expert at the Washington think tank American Enterprise Institute, suggested the use of &quot;plummet&quot; is best left to wordsmiths. &quot;If I was looking at these numbers for Obama, I wouldn&rsquo;t use the word &lsquo;plummet,&rsquo; but it certainly is a significant change,&quot; Bowman said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur Webster&rsquo;s dictionary describes &quot;plummet&quot; as a sharp and abrupt drop. Most of the changes in Brown&rsquo;s approval ratings occurred over little more than a month. Polls are best read over the course of time, but Brown&rsquo;s drop in this one is relatively quick.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Mandel&rsquo;s statement is accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it bears noting that while he correctly cited data that showed Brown&rsquo;s approval rating had declined, the poll wasn&rsquo;t full of good news for Mandel, either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPPP found that only 24 percent of Ohio voters held a favorable opinion of Mandel. That&rsquo;s still better than the 14 percent he got in January. Most voters then didn&rsquo;t have an opinion of him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConversely, 39 percent of Ohio voters held an unfavorable view of Mandel in late June -- 14 points worse than in January, PPP data show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo both these candidates might have a problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Mandel&rsquo;s numbers left out the question that may matter most: For whom would you vote? He was selective in his data, ignoring the top line of the PPP finding that said Brown &quot;holds steady&quot; in his lead. The <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/presidential-swing-states-%28fl-oh-and-pa%29/release-detail?ReleaseID=1767\">latest Quinnipiac poll</a> gave Brown a whopping 16-point lead in the horse race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this context, you&rsquo;d expect a politician to choose his best data, however selective. Mandel&rsquo;s statement omits additional information that provides clarity. But the numbers he chose were accurate, despite the rhetoric.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s why we rate Mandel&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-12T17:58:30.865148", "ruling_date": "2012-07-13T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Josh Mandel campaign says Sherrod Brown's approval ratings have plummeted", "ruling_headline_slug": "josh-mandel-campaign-says-sherrod-browns-approval-", "ruling_link_text": "Selective use of data overlooks poll's bad news", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJosh Mandel fund-raising email, July 9, 1012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail between PolitiFact Ohio and Travis Considine, communications director for Mandel campaign, July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012-archive.html\">Public Policy Polling polls,</a> January, May and June, accessed July 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Tom Jensen, director, Public Policy Polling, July 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Karlyn Bowman, American Enterprise Institute, July 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute\">Quinnipiac University polls</a>, January, February, May and June, accessed July 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with <a href=\"http://cps.gwu.edu/facultyexperts/chrisArterton.html\">Christopher Arterton</a>, professor of political management, George Washington University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Political Management, July 10, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Ohio treasurer", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Josh", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 612, "last_name": "Mandel", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "josh-mandel", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/612/", "total_count": 31, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.tos.ohio.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSherrod Brown&rsquo;s approval rating &quot;has plummeted to 38 percent among Ohio voters&quot; in a poll by a Democratic pollster.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a fundraising email", "statement_date": "2012-07-09", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 165, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/165/", "subject": "Negative Campaigning", "subject_slug": "campaign-advertising", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Sherrod", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 387, "last_name": "Brown", "mostly_true_count": 9, "name_slug": "sherrod-brown", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-sherrod-brown2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/387/", "total_count": 37, "true_count": 14, "website": "http://www.brown.senate.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
