There's\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/aug/21/Obama-lobby/\">\n  a bit of fine print on this, however, as we've reported previously\n </a>\n . Obama does not take money from registered federal lobbyists, but he does take money from state lobbyists, retired lobbyists and spouses of lobbyists.\n</p>\n<p>\n The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has a broad definition of lobbyist money that includes contributions from spouses of lobbyists. By its reckoning, Obama has received $115,163 in money from lobbyists based on data released on March 20, 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\n We can't say how much of that comes from contributors connected with oil and gas lobbyists versus other kinds of lobbyists. Many lobbyists represent more than one industry.\n</p>\n<p>\n It's worth noting, however, that Obama's total lags his significantly behind Clinton, who got $865,290, from lobbyists, and John McCain, who got $590,952.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is it possible that Barack Obama took \"a dime\" from someone connected to oil and gas lobbyists? Yes. But it looks as if Obama took good-faith measures not to accept money from current lobbyists for any industry, including oil and gas.
