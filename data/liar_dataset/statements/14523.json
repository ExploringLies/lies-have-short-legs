More to the point, it is too soon to say that the U.S. response to Irma was the largest response to a hurricane, and it definitely was not the first time an aircraft carrier was deployed for that reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Military response to Hurricane Irma is significant, but it&rsquo;s too soon to say it&rsquo;s the largest ever</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurricane Irma struck the U.S. Virgin Islands as a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/09/06/extreme-category-5-irma-crashes-into-caribbean-sets-sights-on-florida-and-southeast-u-s/?deferJs=true&amp;outputType=default-article&amp;utm_term=.998b71cbbeed\">Category 5 storm</a>&nbsp;and skirted along Puerto Rico&rsquo;s coast with 185 mph winds. The storm continued on a track towards Florida, where it hit the Keys as a Category 4 hurricane in the Florida Keys and then again on Marco Island as a Category 3. The storm caused major, widespread damage from Miami to Naples to Tampa and Jacksonville.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to Irma, the Defense Department said on Tuesday that it had dispatched 10,000 service members to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and 20,700 <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1308102/update-dod-response-to-hurricane-irma-september-12-2017-500-pm-edt/\">in the eastern United States</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Guard <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USNationalGuard\">reported Sept. 12</a> that it had deployed more than 15,500 guardsmen in response to Irma. In addition to service members, the Pentagon has deployed nine ships and the USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier controlled by the Navy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These numbers could change as the department assesses what is needed. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, by numbers alone, the response to Irma at the time of this claim doesn&rsquo;t quite stack up against the Pentagon&rsquo;s response to Hurricane Katrina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Sept. 7, 2005, nine days after Katrina made landfall, operations included 17,417 active-duty troops, 42,990 National Guardsmen, 20 U.S. ships, 360 helicopters and 93 military planes, according to a Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33095.pdf\">report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whether the Irma efforts become the largest deployment of U.S. military forces after a natural disaster remains to be seen, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that more than 12,000 Department of Defense personnel assisted with Unified Assistance, and thousands were deployed after Hurricane Katrina,&quot; said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More broadly, if you consider all naval and Marine operations (not just hurricane relief), then Bossert&rsquo;s claim is even more inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Clearly this was nowhere near the biggest naval/Marine operation ever&mdash;it was dwarfed by big wartime operations from World War II and the Korean war and even Operation Desert Storm,&quot; said Michael O&rsquo;Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Is this the first time the United States has deployed an aircraft carrier?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Navy Office of Information confirmed that this was not the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed to help hurricane recovery efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Hurricane Katrina, the <a href=\"http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=19905\">USS Harry S. Truman deployed</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;rescue and recovery operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the USS Saipan was deployed after Hurricane Hazel in 1954. And it&rsquo;s not only hurricanes. In 1959, the USS Kearsarge deployed to Japan to help with relief efforts related to Typhoon Vera. The USS Abraham Lincoln was also sent to Sumatra to provide support for Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Bossert said the Defense Department&nbsp;had put together &quot;the largest-ever mobilization of our military in a naval and Marine operation.&quot; He also added that for the first time ever an &quot;Air Force carrier&quot; had been deployed in the effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bossert misspoke when he said &quot;Air Force&quot; carrier, but it&rsquo;s still not the first time an aircraft carrier has been used after a natural disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, it is too soon to say that the military response to Hurricane Irma was the largest ever.
