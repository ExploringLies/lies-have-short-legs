The tweet was posted on Aug. 12, 2018, two days before Wisconsin&rsquo;s primary elections. Schimel ran <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/page/candidates_on_ballot_by_election_for_partisan_prim_25992.pdf\">unopposed</a> in the Republican primary, seeking re-election as the state attorney general, where he leads the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text of Schimel&rsquo;s tweet noted that Wisconsin law requires a photo identification to vote. The reference to beer comes in the 40-second video, which also focuses on the voter ID law and was produced as part of his re-election campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Tweets: In Wisconsin, &quot;300,000 voters were turned away by the state&rsquo;s strict voter ID law&quot; in the 2016 presidential election. <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/07/tweets/were-300000-wisconsin-voters-turned-away-polls-201/\">False</a>.</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The video begins with words on the screen, echoed by a narrator, that say:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Integrity.

In fact, some stores have policies to ID everybody, regardless of whether age has shown its physical signs or not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Schimel didn&rsquo;t say you might be carded.
