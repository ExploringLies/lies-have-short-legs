A main one? There&rsquo;s no &quot;open borders bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/oct/08/trump-stump-his-reasons-fear-democrats-fact-checke/\"><em>Trump on the campaign trail: His 3 reasons to fear Democrats, fact-checked</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is misrepresenting a bill introduced in June by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3036/text\">Keep Families Together Act.</a> The intention of that bill isn&rsquo;t to create open borders, but to prevent the separation of immigrant families arriving at U.S. borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve fact-checked other Republican attacks on this bill and its companion in the U.S. House of Representatives. A <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/06/josh-hawley/hawley-misconstrues-mccaskills-support-keep-famili/\">False</a> claim in Missouri said the bill &quot;would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border.&quot; Similarly, a <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2018/oct/02/martha-mcsally/did-kyrsten-sinema-support-bill-encouraging-child-/\">False</a> claim in Arizona about the House bill said it was &quot;essentially encouraging child trafficking.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Keep Families Together Act is not &lsquo;Open Borders bill&rsquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein introduced the Keep Families Together Act at the height of family separations caused by Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jun/06/what-you-need-know-about-trump-administrations-zer/\">&quot;zero-tolerance&quot; immigration policy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill sought to prohibit federal agents and officers from separating a child from a parent or legal guardian at or near a port of entry or within 100 miles of U.S. borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separations would be allowed under specific circumstances: if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there&#39;s a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies could also separate a child from a parent if it&#39;s in the child&#39;s best interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point of Feinstein&rsquo;s bill is to prohibit separations as a policy to deter immigrants from coming to the United States, &quot;or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a &lsquo;pass&rsquo; &mdash; free or otherwise &mdash; to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States,&quot; David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank told us for a similar <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/06/josh-hawley/hawley-misconstrues-mccaskills-support-keep-famili/\">Missouri fact-check</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immigration experts have also told us that the Senate and House versions of Keep Families Together Act don&rsquo;t prohibit the removal or detention of adults and families. The proposals also don&rsquo;t supersede immigration laws. Immigrants would still have to go through proceedings to proof any claims for asylum or other relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein&rsquo;s bill also calls for annual reports on family separations. Such reports would include whether an adult was charged with a crime, the type of crime, if the adult was prosecuted, and the outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump routinely claims Democrats want &quot;open borders.&quot; He bases this attack line on Democrats&#39; general opposition to Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/\">promised U.S.-Mexico border wall</a>. Democrats favor other border security measures and argue that the wall would be too expensive, especially since Mexico refuses to pay for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders, and it&#39;s a bill, it&#39;s called the &lsquo;open borders bill&rsquo;,&quot; written by Feinstein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no such bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill introduced by Feinstein, and supported by all Senate Democrats, is meant to stop family separations at the border. The measure does not eliminate the enforcement of immigration laws.
