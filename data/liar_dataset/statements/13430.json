But to call it the deciding vote is misleading in that support from Feingold -- unlike some other senators who had to be persuaded to vote yes -- was never in doubt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qriNqE3etkg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">the chamber&rsquo;s ad</a>, which was released Oct. 28, 2016, makes more attacks on Feingold regarding the law, saying of Feingold:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He said we could keep our doctors and our plans. It was rated as the Lie of the Year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s give that claim an examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;Keep our doctors and our plans&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chamber cites <a href=\"http://lacrossetribune.com/news/opinion/russ-feingold-setting-the-record-straight-on-reform/article_966124aa-3faa-11df-919e-001cc4c002e0.html\">a column</a> Feingold wrote for the La Crosse Tribune during his 2010 campaign, which ended with a loss to Johnson. The column poses questions and answers about Obamacare. It does not mention doctors, but the first question covers plans:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I currently purchase my own insurance. Will this bill force me into a public plan?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold&rsquo;s answer:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>No. The health care law does not create a public plan. If you like the plan you purchase, the health care reform bill does not force you to change it.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the chamber&rsquo;s claim is that Feingold said &quot;we could keep our doctors and plans&quot; under Obamacare. Feingold, though answering a question about a &quot;public plan,&quot; essentially said the same -- that the law &quot;does not force you&quot; to change insurance plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we also found <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101028215458/http://www.russfeingold.org/issues/health-care.html\">this statement</a> about Obamacare on Feingold&rsquo;s 2010 campaign website:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You will be allowed to see the doctor of your choice and, if you like your current plan, you are free to keep it.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings us to the second part of the chamber&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;Rated as the Lie of the Year&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part claims that what Feingold said was rated as the Lie of the Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reference is to PolitiFact National&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/\">Lie of the Year for 2013</a>, which was this statement made repeatedly by Obama and others about the Affordable Care Act: &quot;If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Feingold campaign argues that insurance plans existing before 2010 were grandfathered in under the law, but that employers and insurance companies chose to make changes, causing cancellations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But our colleagues wrote that Obama&rsquo;s promise &quot;was impossible to keep&quot;:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>As cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized Obama&rsquo;s breezy assurances were wrong.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief. &nbsp;Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting they had been misunderstood all along. The stunning political uproar led to this: a rare presidential apology &hellip;.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Affordable Care Act tried to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called &quot;grandfathering,&quot; which basically said insurance companies could keep selling plans if they followed certain rules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe problem for insurers was that the Obamacare rules were strict. If the plans deviated even a little, they would lose their grandfathered status. In practice, that meant insurers canceled plans that didn&rsquo;t meet new standards.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. chamber says Feingold said that with Obamacare &quot;we could keep our doctors and our plans, it was rated as the Lie of the Year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold did make that statement about keeping doctors and insurance plans during his 2010 Senate campaign.
