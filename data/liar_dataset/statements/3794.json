Don&rsquo;t listen to the rhetoric,&quot; he said. High gas prices. A rising national debt. High unemployment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Forty-seven million people on food stamps,&quot; Cain said. &quot;That&rsquo;s 14 million more than when the current occupant of the White House took over.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFood stamps? your PolitiFact Georgia scribes wondered. What&rsquo;s with Georgia Republicans and food stamps lately?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast week, the state&rsquo;s other presidential contender, Newt Gingrich, said Obama deserves to be called &quot;the most successful food stamp president in American history&quot; because &quot;47 million Americans are on food stamps.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ruled Gingrich&rsquo;s statement Half True. For the most part, Gingrich got his facts straight but oversimplified who was to blame.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain, a former radio talk show host and Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza CEO, urged the crowd at his rally to &quot;look at the facts.&quot; PolitiFact Georgia is all to happy to oblige him. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFood stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, give certain low-income Americans vouchers to buy groceries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent data show roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits in February, the most recent data available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain&rsquo;s numbers aren&rsquo;t quite accurate, but he&rsquo;s close. The number of recipients has topped 44 million since December, which means his estimate is about 7 percent too high. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number of beneficiaries has climbed every single month since Obama took office, despite signs of an improving economy. According to historical data, February&rsquo;s count appears to be the highest in any month since the program was established in 1969.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama took office in January 2009. That month, nearly 32 million people received SNAP benefits. That means the number of food stamp recipients has increased by about 12.2 million since the start of his administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain placed the increase at 14 million, which is about 15 percent too high. Again, he&rsquo;s close, but not quite right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether Obama deserves the blame for the increase is far less clear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the Great Recession, which started more than a year before Obama took office. Conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether SNAP usage would have been lower if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to tell.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush because of policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tAnother reason assigning blame is tough is that there is typically a lag between when the broader economy begins to recover and when SNAP usage declines. The monthly growth has slowed for the past three months, and it could start declining in a month or two.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tCain&rsquo;s accusation against Obama was not as barbed as Gingrich&rsquo;s, but he did lay the blame for food stamp usage at the president&rsquo;s feet. We therefore give the presidential candidate a Mostly True.&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-23T16:38:02.959111", "ruling_date": "2011-05-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cain said food stamp program use up under Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "cain-said-food-stamp-program-use-under-obama", "ruling_link_text": "Former pizza CEO (almost) delivers on food stamp claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tHerman Cain, presidential campaign announcement rally, May 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-defends-calling-barack-obama-food-st/\">Newt Gingrich defends calling Barack Obama &quot;food stamp president&quot;</a>, May 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Food and Nutrition Service, <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34SNAPmonthly.htm\">monthly statistics for participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a>, October 2007 to February 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "", "false_count": 11, "first_name": "Herman", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 1021, "last_name": "Cain", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "herman-cain", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Herman_Cain.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1021/", "total_count": 27, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.caintv.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe U.S. has &quot;47 million people on food stamps.
