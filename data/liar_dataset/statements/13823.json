Facebook flagged the story as being potentially false as part of its efforts to fight fake news in users&rsquo; feeds. The story has been shared on Facebook more than 23,000 times since being posted less than a week ago. The <a href=\"http://www.interestingdailynews.com/man-pardoned-by-obama-3-months-ago-arrested-for-murder/\">tale has</a> <a href=\"http://usahealthylife.com/2017/03/02/man-pardoned-obama-3-months-ago-arrested-murder/\">wound up on</a> <a href=\"http://conservativeflashnews.com/man-pardoned-obama-3-months-ago-arrested-murder/\">other websites</a> since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post claims a Gainesville, Fla., man named James G. Winters was arrested for killing girlfriend Joanna Walker and leaving her body in a car trunk in Orlando. Winters, it says, was pardoned by Obama just 94 days ago, freeing him from a life sentence for drug trafficking and weapons charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These details are fake, although as in many fake news stories, there are some real roots to the premise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama granted <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/pardon/obama-pardons\">1,715 commutations and 212 pardons</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/20/obama-used-more-clemency-power/\">most of any president</a> since Harry Truman. Many of these criminals were nonviolent drug offenders serving exceptionally long sentences under strict federal guidelines from decades ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama had made easing these punishments a campaign promise, and had sought to aid hundreds of people who slipped through the cracks under sentencing revisions created through the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. Part of Obama&rsquo;s actions included granting pardons and sentence commutations. (We wrote an entire story about it, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/politifact/obameter/drug-sentencing/\">which you can read here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One story <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2016/03/crack-dealer-freed-early-under-obama-plan-murders-woman-2-kids/\">circulated by Obama detractors</a> was of Wendell Callahan, a convicted crack dealer who in 2016 was <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/12/0112-3-stabbed-to-death-on-north-side.html\">charged with killing a woman and her two children</a> in Columbus, Ohio. Callahan had been freed under changes in the 2010 law, which Obama supported and signed. Callahan&rsquo;s case is pending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Winters hadn&rsquo;t been freed by Obama, either by pardon or commutation. There is no James Winters on the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/pardon/obama-pardons\">list of 1,927 prisoners</a> affected by executive action. The photo on the story is of Avery Draughty, a California man <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article67628447.html\">convicted of killing his neighbor</a> in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A closer look at the story UndergroundNewsReport.com shows that the site purposely writes outlandish stories to trick readers. The site contains a disclaimer that says all articles &quot;are fiction, and presumably fake news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There also is a link at the end of the story that <a href=\"http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/breaking-satire-makes-fools-gullible-trump-supporters/\">redirects readers to an explanation</a> that the website&rsquo;s owner had created it to see if he could fool readers, specifically supporters of President Donald Trump. The article said the writer circulated his fake stories on &quot;Trump fan groups&quot; to see if they would take the bait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To my surprise, the Trump masses embraced my stories as fact, almost universally,&quot; the author wrote. &quot;It seemed that there wasn&rsquo;t anything I could write that was too wild or outrageous to be believed by this particular audience.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted him via email, the writer identified himself as James McDaniel, a 28-year-old U.S. citizen living in Costa Rica. (The site is <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/undergroundnewsreport.com\">privately registered</a> in Scottsdale, Ariz.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I admit I kind of stumbled into this on accident just playing around and didn&#39;t really expect to get any attention at first,&quot; McDaniel wrote. &quot;People proved to be far more gullible than I previously thought.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim rates Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-06T17:32:57.320066", "ruling_date": "2017-03-06T18:04:27", "ruling_headline": "Report of man pardoned by Obama being arrested for murder is fake", "ruling_headline_slug": "report-man-pardoned-obama-being-arrested-murder-fa", "ruling_link_text": "Author says he was trying to fool people", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>UndergroundNewsReport.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/man-pardoned-obama-2-months-ago-rapes-kills/\">Man pardoned by Obama 3 months ago arrested for murder</a>,&quot; Feb. 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Justice Department, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/pardon/obama-pardons\">Pardons granted by President Barack Obama (2009-2017)</a>,&quot; accessed March 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/20/obama-used-more-clemency-power/\">Obama used clemency power more often than any president since Truman</a>,&quot; Jan. 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/politifact/obameter/drug-sentencing/\">The Obameter: From drug sentencing to commutations, Obama altered prison landscape</a>,&quot; Jan. 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JudicialWatch.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2016/03/crack-dealer-freed-early-under-obama-plan-murders-woman-2-kids/\">Crack Dealer Freed Early Under Obama Plan Murders Woman, 2 Kids</a>,&quot; March 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Columbus Dispatch, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/12/0112-3-stabbed-to-death-on-north-side.html\">Man charged with killing woman, 2 daughters had early prison release</a>,&quot; Jan. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with James McDaniel, UndergroundNewsReport.com administrator, March 6, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3855, "last_name": "UndergroundNewsReport.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "undergroundnewsreportcom", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3855/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://undergroundnewsreport.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Man pardoned by Obama three&nbsp;months ago arrested for murder.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an Internet post", "statement_date": "2017-02-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
