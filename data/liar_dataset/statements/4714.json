We know what it takes. But we&rsquo;ve got so much more work to do. And I keep a checklist in my desk, and I kind of see, all right, I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign -- (laughter) -- and let me see, yes, I got that done -- (laughter) -- and that one, yes. No, that one&rsquo;s not done yet. (Laughter.) So we&rsquo;ve got about 60 percent done in three years but -- (applause) -- so I&rsquo;m pretty confident we can get the other 40 percent done in the next five years. (Applause.) But to do that, I&rsquo;m going to need your help.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few readers wondered what we thought about this figure, since we&rsquo;ve been using our Obameter to check how well Obama has been keeping 500-plus campaign promises since his inauguration. It is the most comprehensive look at what Obama promised during the campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked, the White House confirmed that it has indeed been using our Obameter as its yardstick.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;By PolitiFact&rsquo;s own independent assessment, the president has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda,&quot; Kate Bedingfield, a White House spokeswoman, told PolitiFact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, Bedingfield&rsquo;s standard -- &quot;achieved or made progress&quot; -- is different from what Obama said at the fundraiser, that he&rsquo;d gotten &quot;about 60 percent done.&quot; And that becomes a crucial difference as we rate Obama&rsquo;s original comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo explain, let&rsquo;s first provide some background on our promise meter, the Obameter. The promises we&rsquo;re tracking were all made during the campaign; they do not include promises made since Obama took office. We rate them as Promise Kept, Compromise, In the Works, Stalled or Promise Broken.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne caveat: we&#39;re constantly in the process of updating our list of promises, so the numbers change frequently. Given the sheer number of promises Obama made, we haven&rsquo;t managed to update some in a year or more. The bottom line is that any estimates from our work as it stands today should be made with a grain of salt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, here&rsquo;s the current breakdown of promises on the Obameter:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Promise Kept </strong>151, or 30 percent<br />\r\n\t<strong>Compromise </strong>46, or 9 percent<br />\r\n\t<strong>In the Works </strong>189, or 37 percent<br />\r\n\t<strong>Stalled </strong>68, or 13 percent<br />\r\n\t<strong>Promise Broken </strong>52, or 10 percent<br />\r\n\t<strong>Not Yet Rated </strong>2, or 0.3 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think it&rsquo;s reasonable to give Obama credit for accomplishing the promises rated Promise Kept or Compromise. Together, those account for 39 percent of all promises.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the same time, we think it&rsquo;s fair to say the president hasn&rsquo;t accomplished those rated Stalled or Promise Broken. Together, those account for 23 percent of all promises.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut to reach 60 percent, the White House needs to include a lot of promises rated In the Works in its count of what&#39;s been &quot;done.&quot; And that&rsquo;s a problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate promises In the Works if the administration or its allies in Congress have taken steps to implement the promise but haven&rsquo;t done enough to move it to either Promise Kept or Promise Broken. Generally speaking, we have had a low threshold for moving promises from Not Yet Rated to In the Works. For instance, if a House Member introduced a bill to enact the promise, we might move it to In the Works -- long before the bill was even considered by the House -- &nbsp;much less passed by Congress and signed by the president. Our threshold for moving a promise to Kept, Broken or Compromise is much more stringent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Bedingfield is accurate to say that Obama &quot;has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent&quot; of his promises, but Obama himself was wrong to say in his original statement that his agenda is &quot;60 percent done.&quot; In the Works, which in some cases may consist only of tiny steps toward accomplishment, is not &quot;done.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s still theoretically possible that Obama could get to 60 percent. To do so, he&rsquo;d have to score 108 Promise Kept or Compromise ratings out of the 189 promises currently rated In the Works. That would be 57 percent, a steep but not impossible figure. That also assumes he keeps all of his current Promise Kept ratings -- something that could be at risk from, say, an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling on his health care law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, getting the required 57 percent is going to be a huge challenge when facing a Congress where Republicans steadfastly opposed to his agenda control the House of Representative and have displayed great unity in blocking the president.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama&rsquo;s statement at the fundraiser was clearly in the past tense -- about having already &quot;done&quot; 60 percent of his promises in three years, and a White House spokeswoman made it clear he was relying on numbers from our Obameter. The White House&rsquo;s subsequent description -- that Obama &quot;has achieved or made progress on over 60 percent of his agenda&quot; -- is essentially accurate based on our data, but that&rsquo;s not what Obama himself said. By our numbers, the best he can claim for now is 39 percent. So we rate his statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-01T15:48:56.667501", "ruling_date": "2011-11-01T16:26:55", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says 60 percent of his promises are 'done'", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-60-percent-his-promises-are-done", "ruling_link_text": "\"In the Works\" does not equal \"done\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/25/remarks-president-campaign-event-0\">comments</a> at a fundraiser in Los Angeles, Oct. 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/\">Obameter main page</a>, accessed Nov. 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Kate Bedingfield, White House associate communications director, Nov. 1, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign. ...
