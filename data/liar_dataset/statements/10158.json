Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said college students on average are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt, we rated her claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/04/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-claims-college-students-graduate-300/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True</u></a>. Some reliable data indicated the figure is accurate, but other figures suggested it might be lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families, our rating was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/13/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-affluent-taking-advantage-student-loan/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly False</u></a>. He overstated the problem on both ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the governor&rsquo;s race, Democratic challenger Mary Burke has said easing student loan debt is one of her priorities. Her claim that there are 41,000 people on a waitlist for financial aid for Wisconsin technical colleges and universities earned a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/02/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-41000-people-are-waitlist-financia/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>. The number wasn&#39;t totally firm, but pretty solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has touted his tuition freeze at University of Wisconsin System schools rather than discussing college financial aid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on Oct. 27, 2014, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>run TV ads</u></a> criticizing Walker, released <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr-r3pdHr6s&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>another ad</u></a> making this claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Scott Walker opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Refinancing proposals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out the Greater Wisconsin Committee doesn&rsquo;t have any proof that Walker opposed a state proposal to help students refinance student debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, the group contends that since Walker didn&rsquo;t speak, or take action, in favor of the plan&nbsp;proposed by Democrats, he opposed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker &quot;has had every opportunity to show support for this legislative proposal. He specifically chose not to express support and has instead avoided the topic altogether,&quot; the group&rsquo;s executive director, Rich Judge, told us in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judge referred to <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/studentdebtbill.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>legislation</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/bill-sponsored-by-wisconsin-democrats-would-ease-student-loan-debt-b99125859z1-228938911.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>announced</u></a> in October 2013 to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Legislative committee hearings were held on the proposal in February 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no votes were ever taken by a committee or the full Legislature, so the issue never reached Walker&rsquo;s desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judge also noted that Walker refused an April 2014 request from Democrats to hold a special session of the Legislature. But he noted that request was to take up not only the refinancing proposal but a number of other bills, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Judge cited a September 2014 <a href=\"http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/09/walker-pushes-uw-tuition-freeze-downplays-deficit/15359739/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news article</u></a> in the Green Bay Press-Gazette about a Walker campaign appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker did not speak specifically about student loan debt during the stop, but did say he prefers controlling tuition over government-subsidized financial aid, the newspaper reported. Walker was quoted as saying: &quot;We know it&#39;s not just about providing more financial assistance, it&#39;s about providing a great price for a UW education that&#39;s low to begin with.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of the above shows opposition by the governor to the refinance proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found another September 2014 <u><a href=\"http://journaltimes.com/news/local/walker-highlights-tuition-freeze-in-parkside-stop/article_7e874809-20bf-589a-8c3d-0b02452bd138.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">news article</a>,</u>&nbsp;in the Racine Journal Times. That article reported that Walker said he would be willing to look at measures like the refinancing bill, but questioned whether the proposal is &quot;more than just politics&quot; because Democrats had not enacted it when they controlled the Legislature and the governor&rsquo;s office prior to his election in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If it was a good idea, I&rsquo;m sure they would have passed it four years ago when they controlled the Assembly and the Senate and the governorship,&quot; Walker was quoted as saying in response to questions from reporters. &quot;They not only did not do it then, they presided over a state government that saw 5.5 percent average annual increases in tuition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker certainly isn&rsquo;t declaring support for the refinancing authority, but he isn&rsquo;t stating opposition, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greater Wisconsin Committee says Walker &quot;opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group acknowledged it has no evidence that Walker opposed a 2013 Democratic proposal to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Walker may not support the idea, but he hasn&rsquo;t fought it, either -- as the group claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date":
