Rick Perry proudly signed legislation into law allowing illegal immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify &mdash; if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they&#39;re able to do so. As of 2008, 22,697 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates. More than 10,000 were enrolled in fall 2008 &mdash; the latest count available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTuition varies among Texas public colleges and universities, which make their own tuition policies and set their own rates on top of the base tuition set by statute: $50 per semester credit hour at four-year universities for Texas residents and $327 for non-residents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry, responding to a reporter&#39;s question, recently said that the Texas Education Agency verifies that undocumented students are making good on their sworn promise to apply for permanent residency.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered if that was so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the second GOP gubernatorial debate Jan. 29, Len Cannon, KHOU-TV Houston news anchor, asked Perry: &quot;You pointed out that for illegal immigrants to get the in-state tuition they have to apply for legal residency, correct?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCannon: &quot;According to the bill it says you have to promise to apply. Does the state then follow up to verify that the application has been made for residency?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry: &quot;It is my understanding, yes, sir, absolutely.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCannon: &quot;And what agency?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry: &quot;TEA.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwice, Cannon repeated the question, with the same result. He tried again one more time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCannon: &quot;TEA does that?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry: &quot;Yes, sir. Texas Education Agency.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClearly, Perry believes the TEA follows up on public college students who enroll as illegal immigrants. But is it true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot according to Suzanne Marchman, TEA spokeswoman, who said the agency oversees primary and secondary public education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The law (at issue) applies to colleges and universities,&quot; she said of House Bill 1403, the measure Perry signed in June 2001 permitting undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at higher education institutions. &quot;Our agency doesn&#39;t oversee any of that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCatherine Frazier, deputy press secretary at the Perry campaign, immediately conceded the governor&#39;s misstatement. Frazier said: &quot;Each university is supposed to follow up on whether undocumented immigrants are pursuing citizenship and report to the (Texas) Higher Education Coordinating Board.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat so? Not exactly, at least not at the University of Texas at Austin: &quot;There&#39;s no requirement in the law that we follow up on that,&quot; said Deana Williams, UT&#39;s assistant director of admissions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWilliams, a UT admissions official since before the 2001 law took effect, said the coordinating board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, has told the schools to collect undocumented students&#39; affidavits and check their transcripts to confirm that they&#39;ve lived in Texas for at least the three years required to be eligible for in-state tuition. Williams said UT keeps the affidavits on record indefinitely but it&#39;s &quot;never required to report or check&quot; whether those students are actively pursuing permanent residency .<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAndy Kesling, the coordinating board&#39;s director of communications, said the board doesn&#39;t follow up with benefiting students at all. Indeed, there&#39;s nothing in the statute requiring it to.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, carried the legislation in the Senate that had been authored in the House by then-Rep. Rick Noriega. Van de Putte told us: &quot;There&#39;s nobody checking, but they technically could &mdash; there&#39;s nothing prohibiting them from checking and there&#39;s nothing that mandates them to check.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd while undocumented students can apply for permanent residency, current immigration laws generally preclude them from obtaining a green card without an employer&#39;s sponsorship. The DREAM Act, proposed federal legislation that has several times failed to pass Congress, would allow undocumented students to obtain permanent residency after two years of college or military service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s almost like a Catch-22,&quot; Van de Putte said. &quot;There&#39;s so many hoops and barriers. Getting the education is just one part.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the moment, it appears that no state agency checks up on whether students benefiting from HB 1403 pursue permanent residency. We rate both Perry&#39;s claim &mdash; and his campaign aide&#39;s attempted correction &mdash; False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-11T12:45:51.681528", "ruling_date": "2010-02-14T20:11:51", "ruling_headline": "Perry says the TEA checks whether undocumented students are applying for permanent residency", "ruling_headline_slug": "perry-says-tea-checks-whether-undocumented-student", "ruling_link_text": "TEA: No way", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTexas Legislature, <a href=\"http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Authors.aspx?LegSess=77R&amp;Bill=HB1403\" target=\"_blank\">House Bill 1403,</a> accessed Feb. 9, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTexas Debates, Jan. 29, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNational Conference of State Legislature, <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Immigration/InStateTuitionandUnauthorizedImmigrants/tabid/13100/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">In-state tuition and unauthorized immigrant students,</a> revised Jan. 28, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Catherine Frazier, Texans for Rick Perry deputy press secretary, Feb. 9, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Suzanne Marchman, spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, Feb. 5, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Andy Kesling, communications director for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Feb. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Deana Williams, University of Texas at Austin assistant director of admissions, Feb. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with <a href=\"http://www.vandeputte.senate.state.tx.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Sen.
