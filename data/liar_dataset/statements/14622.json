It was developed by the <a href=\"http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\">Gun Violence Archive</a>, a group that logs shootings across the country by crowdsourcing media reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under its definition, which does not require that anyone is necessarily killed, there have been more than 270 mass shootings so far this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there have been far fewer of these crimes where, as Clinton termed it, &quot;four or more people are killed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More restrictive criteria</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/\">database</a> compiled by <em>Mother Jones</em>, a liberal magazine, shows there have been only three mass shootings so far&nbsp;this year that meet&nbsp;the&nbsp;four-or-more measurement expressed by Clinton at the speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magazine itself shows seven mass shootings so far this year because it uses three or more deaths as its criteria. It excludes more conventional crimes such as armed robberies and gang violence in its count, focusing instead on &quot;the distinct phenomenon of mass shootings.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gun Violence Archive, meanwhile, which includes gang shootings and home invasion robberies as mass shootings, had tallied 19 shootings in which four or more people were killed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the federal government has used the more restrictive criteria of four or more killed to define a mass shooting. We found there&rsquo;s no widely accepted definition that doesn&rsquo;t create its own share of questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Clinton pointed to the Gun Violence Archive&rsquo;s definition for mass shootings, but did not immediately provide an explanation for Clinton&rsquo;s misstatement of that definition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton in her UC Davis speech said there have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States so far this year. She defined the events as &quot;where four or more are killed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research has shown that a broad definition of mass shootings requires four or more people to be killed <em>or injured.</em> There have been more than 270 of those horrific crimes so far this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Clinton left out the key words <em>&quot;or injured,&quot;</em> dramatically changing the criteria for these shootings. There have been a much smaller number of mass shootings that meet this stricter criteria of &quot;four or more people killed,&quot; nowhere near the 270 she claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Clinton&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-10-10T17:44:05.188532", "ruling_date": "2017-10-10T15:51:26", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s False claim on mass shootings", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clintons-false-claim-mass-shootings", "ruling_link_text": "Clinton misstates key part of mass shooting definition", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtws4TzKso4\">speech</a>, Oct. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick Merrill, spokesman for Hillary Clinton, email exchange Oct. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mother Jones</em>, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/\">US Mass Shootings, 1982-2017: Data From Mother Jones&rsquo; Investigation</a>, Oct. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\">Gun Violence Archive</a>&nbsp;website, accessed October 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact California, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2017/oct/04/mass-shooting-what-does-it-mean/\">How is a &lsquo;mass shooting&rsquo; defined?</a>, Oct. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/04/tammy-baldwin/was-las-vegas-mass-shooting-273rd-year-or-seventh-/\">Was the Las Vegas mass shooting the 273rd this year?
