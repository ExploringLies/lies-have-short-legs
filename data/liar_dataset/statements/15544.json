(<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">Read more</a> about our partnership with Facebook.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One of Twitter&#39;s senior engineers has admitted to hacking the president&#39;s private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice,&quot; the Neon Nettle story said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline is based on comments made by a Twitter engineer, but the engineer never said he had leaked information to the Justice Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story cited a <a href=\"https://www.projectveritas.com/2018/01/09/undercover-video-sr-network-security-engineer-reveals-twitter-ready-to-give-trumps-private-dms-to-doj/\">video</a> from Project Veritas, an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James O&rsquo;Keefe, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/us/politics/27landrieu.html\">pleaded guilty</a> to a misdemeanor count in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building and was <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/03/james-okeefe-federal-lawsuit/\">sued</a> for $1 million in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project Veritas has a <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/10/18/project-veritas-election-videos/\">proven history</a> of using <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/what-you-dont-see-in-okeefe-video-may-be-as-important-as-what-you-do/2017/06/28/dcb67446-5b7c-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d39ef4a0cce4\">undercover reporting</a>, hidden cameras and selectively-edited video recordings to serve a predetermined narrative. In 2017, the organization <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7dcd86aed726\">sent</a> a woman posing as a sexual assault victim of Roy Moore &mdash; a candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama &mdash; to the <em>Washington Post</em> in an apparent effort to discredit the paper&rsquo;s investigation into Moore&rsquo;s predatory behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this particular sting video, Project Veritas used hidden cameras to surreptitiously record two separate conversations between undercover journalists and Clay Haynes, a senior network security engineer at Twitter, according to LinkedIn. The journalists, dressed in disguises, asked leading questions in a clear effort to elicit certain responses from Haynes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation (into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election),&quot; Haynes, who also expressed his personal disdain for Trump, said at one point. &quot;Basically, giving them every single tweet that he&rsquo;s posted. Even the ones he&rsquo;s deleted, any direct messages, any mentions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second interview, Haynes said of the possibility of turning over Trump&rsquo;s messages, &quot;We have a subpoena process for that very reason.&quot; When asked whether Twitter was working with the Justice Department, he declined to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both interviews occurred in January 2018, and Twitter issued a statement after Project Veritas published its video. &quot;The individual depicted in this video was speaking in a personal capacity and does not represent or speak for Twitter,&quot; a company spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/project-veritas-twitter-video-company-responds-allegations-it-can-share-trumps-2639802\">said</a>. &quot;Twitter only responds to valid legal requests, and does not share any user information with law enforcement without such a request.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We deplore the deceptive and underhanded tactics by which this footage was obtained and selectively edited to fit a predetermined narrative,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;Twitter is committed to enforcing our rules without bias and empowering every voice on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is unclear from the video whether Haynes knew he was being recorded, though he does not seem to be aware. It is <a href=\"http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/california-recording-law\">illegal</a> to record a private conversation without the consent of both parties in California, where the video was taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Snopes previously <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/10/18/project-veritas-election-videos/\">noted</a>, Project Veritas&rsquo; videos are &quot;virtually impossible to fact check without complete clips of the involved conversations&quot; because they use &quot;stitched-together, out-of-context remarks with no indication of what occurred or what was discussed just before and after the included portions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Twitter&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-law-enforcement-support\">Help Center</a>, legal processes are required to trigger the release of private messages. &quot;Non-public information about Twitter users will not be released to law enforcement except in response to appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal process,&quot; the company policy said. &quot;Requests for the contents of communications &hellip; require a valid search warrant or equivalent from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Twitter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haynes did not say that Twitter leaked private messages from Trump. He said only that the company would be &quot;more than happy to help the DOJ&quot; were such help ever triggered by a legal process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any reports that Twitter was cooperating in this fashion with special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s probe into the 2016 election, although the company did <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-senate-committee-russia-bots/\">meet</a> with the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss Russian bot accounts on its site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even if we were to take Project Veritas&rsquo; video at face value, the Neon Nettle headline was misleading. The video showed Twitter to be capable of granting access to Trump&rsquo;s private messages &mdash; a capability that most technology companies maintain &mdash; but the company was not caught leaking them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neon Nettle did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-28T10:24:09.213991", "ruling_date": "2018-06-28T10:46:37", "ruling_headline": "Website falsely claimed Twitter caught leaking private Trump messages to the Justice Department", "ruling_headline_slug": "website-falsely-claimed-twitter-caught-leaking-pri", "ruling_link_text": "An old falsehood", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Neon Nettle, <a href=\"http://www.neonnettle.com/features/1306-twitter-caught-leaking-donald-trump-s-private-messages-in-undercover-sting\">&quot;Twitter Caught Leaking Donald Trump&rsquo;s Private Messages in Undercover Sting,&quot;</a> January 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project Veritas, <a href=\"https://www.projectveritas.com/2018/01/09/undercover-video-sr-network-security-engineer-reveals-twitter-ready-to-give-trumps-private-dms-to-doj/\">&quot;UNDERCOVER VIDEO: Sr Network Security Engineer Reveals Twitter Ready to Give Trump&rsquo;s Private DMs to DOJ,&quot;</a> January 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter Help Center, <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-law-enforcement-support\">&quot;Guidelines for law enforcement,&quot;</a> accessed June 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International Business Times, <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/project-veritas-twitter-video-company-responds-allegations-it-can-share-trumps-2639802\">&quot;Project Veritas Twitter Video: Company Responds To Allegations It Can Share Trump&#39;s Deleted, Direct Messages,&quot;</a> January 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/10/18/project-veritas-election-videos/\">&quot;Project Veritas&rsquo; Election 2016 &lsquo;Rigging&rsquo; Videos,&quot;</a> October 18, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Twitter caught leaking Donald Trump&rsquo;s private messages in undercover sting.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-01-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 177, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/177/", "subject": "Criminal Justice", "subject_slug": "criminal-justice", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 35, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/35/", "subject": "Ethics", "subject_slug": "ethics", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
