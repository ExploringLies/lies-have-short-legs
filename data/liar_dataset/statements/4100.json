They only pave the way for a court battle, should the law ultimately be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Does it allow Floridians to opt out if it&rsquo;s successful? Yes,&quot; said Christie Herrara, director of ALEC&rsquo;s health task force. &quot;A lawsuit would have to be filed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;opt out,&quot; in that case, would come as the result of a legal challenge by states that would argue their constitutions prohibit the implementation of the federal health care law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s a long shot any federal court would side with the states&rsquo; argument.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There is a whole body of case law that is very consistent,&quot; said Barry Richard, a Tallahassee-based constitutional law attorney who represented George W. Bush in the 2000 vote recount. &quot;This is not a close call.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLawyers and legal scholars say the states&rsquo; challenge would be tossed aside because of <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html\">Article VI of the U.S. Constitution</a>, and a paragraph known as the supremacy clause.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpecifically, the clause states that the U.S. Constitution, and federal treaties and laws are the &quot;supreme Law of the Land.&quot; It requires state judges to follow federal law in any conflict with state laws or constitutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this situation, the federal law requires that people have health insurance, a provision commonly called the &quot;individual mandate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHaridopolos&rsquo; amendment to the Florida Constitution would prohibit laws that compel people to have health care coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is precisely what the supremacy clause was meant to deal with, when you have the federal government saying one thing and the state saying something else,&quot; said Mike Allen, a constitutional law professor at Stetson University in Gulfport.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt would be impossible to comply with both laws at once, he said. And in such instances, he said, the federal law almost always wins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s necessary, says Steve Valdeck, a law professor at American University, to preserve the structure of the U.S. government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think we have settled the question that the Constitution makes the federal government supreme over the states. If one state could decide on its own they want to withdraw from a federal law, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop other states from doing it,&quot; Valdeck said. &quot;Pretty soon you&rsquo;ve destroyed the central premise on which our country is founded, which is a central federal government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow there is one scenario in which Haridopolos&rsquo; amendment could protect Floridians from an individual mandate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately rules in favor of the 26 states suing to stop implementation of the individual mandate, Florida&rsquo;s constitutional amendment would be moot as far as federal health care reform is concerned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, the state constitutional amendment would prohibit future state Legislatures from enacting an individual mandate if they ever decide to put forward their own health care plan, as Massachusetts did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Haridopolos didn&rsquo;t mention protecting Floridians from a state law. He referred specifically to Obama and the federal law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBottom line: All the state constitutional amendment guarantees is standing for a lawsuit against the federal government. Floridians could only &quot;opt out&quot; of the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s individual mandate if the U.S. Supreme Court rules against the supremacy of the federal law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a major, gigantic if. There&rsquo;s at least a remote enough chance that the court would rule in favor of Florida in a lawsuit, so Haridopolos&rsquo; statement doesn&rsquo;t warrant a Pants On Fire ruling. However, it&rsquo;s clearly False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-13T11:53:08.107770", "ruling_date": "2011-07-13T14:58:51", "ruling_headline": "Mike Haridopolos says Florida law could allow state to 'opt out' of federal health care plan ", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-haridopolos-says-florida-law-could-allow-stat", "ruling_link_text": "The chances are slim, and slim", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMike Haridopolos Twitter account, June 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with attorney Barry Richard, July 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Mike Allen, profess of law at Stetson University, July 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Steve Valdeck, professor of law at American University, July 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.alec.org/AM/PDF/hhs/State_Leg_Guide_to_Repealing_ObamaCare.pdf\">State Legislators Guide to Repealing ObamaCare</a>, accessed July 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.azsos.gov/election/2010/Info/PubPamphlet/english/Prop106.htm%20\">Model legislation from the American Legislative Exchange Council</a>, accessed July 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/article/4371%20\">Goldwater Institute Health Care Freedom Act Q&amp;A</a>, accessed July 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://election.dos.state.fl.us/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=10&amp;seqnum=77%20\">Florida&rsquo;s Health Care Freedom Act</a>, accessed July 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html\">The U.S. Constitution</a>, accessed July 8, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Florida Senate President", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 840, "last_name": "Haridopolos", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "mike-haridopolos", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_FLSC112_MIKE_HARIDOPOLOS.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/840/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.flsenate.gov/Legislators/index.cfm?Members=View+Page&District_Num_Link=026&Submenu=1&Tab=legislators&chamber=Senate&CFID=238117333&CFTOKEN=61418412"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tFlorida&rsquo;s proposed Health Care Freedom Act &quot;will allow Floridians to opt out of Obama&rsquo;s govt. takeover of healthcare!&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a posting on Twitter", "statement_date": "2011-06-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
