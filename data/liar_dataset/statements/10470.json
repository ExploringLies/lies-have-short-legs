But as fact-checkers, we were interested in whether a statistic viewed by perhaps 110 million people was accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Nationwide but didn&rsquo;t hear back. The company did, however, release a statement on their website after the public&rsquo;s reaction began to mount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Preventable injuries around the home are the leading cause of childhood deaths in America. Most people don&rsquo;t know that,&quot; Nationwide <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.com/about-us/020115-make-safe-happen.jsp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>wrote</u></a>. &quot;The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance. We want to build awareness of an issue that is near and dear to all of us&mdash;the safety and well being of our children. We knew the ad would spur a variety of reactions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement continued, &quot;While some did not care for the ad, we hope it served to begin a dialogue to make safe happen for children everywhere.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks death by cause. One category is &quot;unintentional injuries,&quot; which encompasses everything from car accidents and falls to drownings and the accidental discharge of a firearm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unintentional injuries&quot; are indeed quite common across most age groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the data, unintentional injury was the leading cause of death in 2013 for Americans among children and adults up to age 44, with one exception: infants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For infants &mdash; children below 1 year of age &mdash; congenital anomalies, or birth defects, resulted in 4,758 deaths in 2013, CDC reported, making them the top killer. Unintentional injuries were fifth with 1,156.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Birth defects continue to claim lives after children pass their first birthday. Through age 14, there were 5,574 cumulative deaths<strong> </strong>from such complications in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare that to unintentional injuries that resulted in deaths. There were 3,993 cumulative deaths in<strong> </strong>2013 among children through age 14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: From birth to 14, the most common cause of death is birth defects. From one year old to 14, the most common cause is accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the question becomes: How do you define &quot;children&quot; -- when childhood starts, and where it ends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a child reaches the mid-to-late teens, the rate of deaths caused by birth defects drops significantly, to about 30 a year for each of the following ages: 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19. But conversely, the number of accidental deaths rises in years 15 through 19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? It&rsquo;s partly because around that time, kids start getting behind the wheel, and the number of transportation accidents increases dramatically. While there are about 500 deaths from transportation-related injuries from ages 10 to 14 combined, it&rsquo;s double that from age 15 to 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the cumulative deaths by accident for each age and how they compare to total deaths by birth defect in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none; width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&lt;15</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&lt;16</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&lt;17</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&lt;18</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&lt;19</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Birth defect</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>5,609</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>5,643</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>5,674</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>5,707</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>5,740</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Accident</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>4,293</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>4,754</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>5,444</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>6,455</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>7,645</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not until you include 18-year-olds in the data does death by accident surpass birth defects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a good argument that this is all semantics. &quot;Infants&quot; can be considered<strong> </strong>distinct from &quot;children,&quot; which would suggest that congenital anomalies of babies should not be factored in. By the same token,<strong> </strong>some might question whether 18- and 19-year-olds are still children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the CDC itself, it tends to separate children under the age of 1 from other age groups in most of their data sets, and an agency spokesman didn&rsquo;t contest the notion that accidents are the leading cause of death among children. And if so, that&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>been the case for a while. In 1999, the earliest year of data that&rsquo;s publicly available, unintentional injury caused the most deaths from age 1 to 34.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This raises another bit of missing context: The number of deaths caused by accidents among children in 2013 is essentially half of what it was 15 years ago. So while it&rsquo;s still the No. 1 killer, it has dropped rather significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A postscript: While we&rsquo;re checking the actual ad in this item, Nationwide erred when it phrased its after-the-fact defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s statement claimed that &quot;preventable injuries <em>around the home</em> are the leading cause of childhood deaths.&quot; Actually, transportation injuries are the top cause of accidental deaths among kids. From age 1 to 14, nearly half of all accidental deaths are related to<strong> </strong>motor vehicles or other types of land transportation. And that rate only increases once you start including older children in their mid-to-late teens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Super Bowl ad, Nationwide claimed, &quot;The No. 1 cause of childhood deaths is preventable accidents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is based on hard numbers from the CDC, and the general trend has been consistent for the last decade and a half. However, there are different ways to slice the numbers, and if infants are counted as children, then congenital anomalies top the list for certain age ranges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-02T16:40:33.821548", "ruling_date": "2015-02-02T17:27:01", "ruling_headline": "Nationwide Super Bowl ad claims accidents are the leading cause of death among children", "ruling_headline_slug": "nationwide-super-bowl-ad-claims-accidents-are-lead", "ruling_link_text": "Mostly depressing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Nationwide&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKUy-tfrIHY\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Super Bowl ad</u></a>, Feb. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationwide, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nationwide.com/about-us/020115-make-safe-happen.jsp\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Nationwide Responds to Super Bowl Reaction</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,<a href=\"http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcaus10_us.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>&nbsp;Leading Causes of Death Reports, National and Regional, 1999 - 2013</u></a>, accessed Feb. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/nvsr62_06.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>National Vital Statistics Reports; Deaths: Leading Causes for 2010</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder Database, &quot;<a href=\"http://wonder.cdc.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Underlying Cause of Death, 1999-2013 Results</u></a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>2013 Mortality Multiple Cause Micro-data Files</u></a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medline Plus,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001915.htm\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Death among children and adolescents,</u></a>&nbsp;Aug. 30, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 3065, "last_name": "Nationwide", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "nationwide", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NrXyl2fF.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3065/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.nationwide.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The No. 1 cause of childhood deaths is preventable accidents.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an ad during the Super Bowl", "statement_date": "2015-02-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 202, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/202/", "subject": "Public Health", "subject_slug": "public-health", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 173, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/173/", "subject": "Public Safety", "subject_slug": "public-safety", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
