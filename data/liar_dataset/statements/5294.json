Nathan Deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s no misprint folks, Gov. Deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal won&rsquo;t be tackling anyone or stiff-arming defenders. Instead, he will appear in a 60-second ad urging Georgia motorists to get a ride home if they&rsquo;ve had too much alcohol on Super Sunday. Of course, there&rsquo;s an app for that. It&rsquo;s called Drive Sober Georgia, and it lists phone numbers for programs that drive tipsy motorists home for free. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No one wants to stop you from enjoying the game,&quot; Deal says in the public service announcement. &quot;However, having too much to drink and getting on the road endangers not only your life, but the lives of others. One out of every three automobile fatalities can be attributed to alcohol.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia wondered: Did Deal score a truth touchdown with this alcohol fatality statistic or should the governor get flagged for a misleading statement?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe consulted the top authorities on drunken driving data. They all cite numbers from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Its Fatality Analysis Reporting System collects yearly statistics on deadly traffic crashes, including ones involving drunken drivers<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NHTSA defines &quot;alcohol-impaired&quot; crashes as those that involve a driver with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher. A sober driver could be at fault.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the NHTSA, 10,839 people were killed in crashes involving alcohol-impaired driving in 2009. This accounts for 32 percent of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe percentage dropped slightly in 2010, when 10,228 people died in alcohol-impaired crashes or 31 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia&rsquo;s percentage of crashes involving alcohol-impaired driving sits well below the national average. In 2010, it was 24 percent, or 298 out of 1,244 fatalities in the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Peach State&rsquo;s neighbor, South Carolina, had the highest percentage of DUI traffic-related fatalities -- 44 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Georgia apparently has a smaller percentage of DUI traffic-related fatalities than most states, some advocates against drunken driving believe the Peach State can do more on the issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMothers Against Drunk Driving advocates were at the state Capitol this week to urge lawmakers to support Senate Bill 41, which would require first-time offenders of Georgia&rsquo;s DUI laws to have an ignition interlock device in their car for at least six months. Georgia law currently requires the device for repeat DUI offenders. An ignition interlock device works like a Breathalyzer. It measures a driver&rsquo;s blood-alcohol content and prevents the car from starting if the reading surpasses a certain level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;MADD believes Georgia can do better,&quot; said Frank Harris, the group&rsquo;s state legislative affairs director.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, back to Deal&rsquo;s claim. Is he right? Can one out of every three automobile fatalities be &quot;attributed&quot; to alcohol?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal&rsquo;s numbers are right. But his language is slightly off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the NHTSA&rsquo;s definition, the drunken driver doesn&rsquo;t have to be at fault for the crash to count as an &quot;alcohol-impaired&quot; wreck. Deal would have been more accurate to say that one out of every three automobile fatalities involves a drunken driver.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, this is a minor point. Deal&rsquo;s overall point holds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t dock him on this technicality. He earns a True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-02T14:44:20.278867", "ruling_date": "2012-02-03T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Deal DUI Super Bowl ad cites good statistic ", "ruling_headline_slug": "deal-dui-super-bowl-ad-cites-good-statistic", "ruling_link_text": "Truth touchdown!", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html\">Impaired Driving fact sheet</a>, accessed Jan. 31, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeorgia Senate <a href=\"http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/pdf/sb41.pdf\">Bill 41</a>, accessed Feb. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMADD state-by-state <a href=\"http://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/campaign/state-stats/\">DUI statistics</a>, accessed Jan. 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with Frank Harris, Mothers Against Drunk Driving state legislative affairs director, Jan. 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, <a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811385.pdf\">2009</a> data, accessed Jan. 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Transportation, <a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811554.pdf\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, State Motor Vehicle Fatalities, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Harris Blackwood, director, Governor&#39;s Office of Highway Safety, Feb. 1, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Nathan", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "", "id": 441, "last_name": "Deal", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "nathan-deal", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NathanDeal.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/441/", "total_count": 52, "true_count": 13, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;One out of every three automobile fatalities can be attributed to alcohol.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television commercial", "statement_date": "2012-01-31", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 186, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/186/", "subject": "Alcohol", "subject_slug": "Alcohol", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 161, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/161/", "subject": "Drugs", "subject_slug": "drugs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
