Barr told Congress that 155 taxpayers making $200,000 or more found a legal way to not pay any taxes on their 1966 income.\n</p>\n<p>\n That shook lawmakers into creating the alternative minimum tax in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. (For comparison's sake, $200,000 in 1966 is nearly $1.3-million in 2007, according to government-run inflation calculators.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Because of the law, people who are able to use deductions and legal shelters to lower their tax bill too much must pay a minimum income tax, the AMT. Under the law, taxpayers who meet the AMT threshold must pay the higher tax bill, whether it's their actual bill or the AMT.\n</p>\n<p>\n But because of the way the law calculates who meets the threshold, more and more people have been swept into the program. By 2006, 3.5-million taxpayers fell under the AMT, which equates to about 4 percent of American taxpayers, according to the Congressional Research Service. That brought in $24-billion in taxes. But that was with a \"patch\" by Congress that limited how many taxpayers are affected.\n</p>\n<p>\n Without a change for 2007, 23.4-million taxpayers are going to be paying the AMT, sending $70-billion to the federal government, according to an estimate by the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.\n</p>\n<p>\n Policymakers have been talking for years about changing the formula that triggers the AMT so that it only catches the very wealthiest taxpayers, but so far the rewrite hasn't happened.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:33.261269", "ruling_date": "2007-11-01T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tax for the rich only, but not anymore", "ruling_headline_slug": "tax-for-the-rich-only-but-not-anymore", "ruling_link_text": "Tax for the rich only, but not anymore", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "\"The Alternative Minimum Tax was never intended to hit people in middle income, upper middle income.
