During her tenure, one nomination was made by President <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/\">Barack Obama</a>, a Democrat, and two were by Republican President <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Senate <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-kavanaugh-supreme-court-confirmation-hearing-20180907-story.html\">expected</a> t<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kavanaugh-hearing-dle/index.html\">o vote</a> on <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/sep/07/fact-checking-brett-kavanaughs-senate-confirmation/\">Kavanaugh&rsquo;s nomination</a> before the end of September 2018, let&rsquo;s go to the Flip-O-Meter to review how Baldwin has considered the three nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>1. Merrick Garland</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>March 2016: </strong>Obama <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/president-obama-to-nominate-merrick-garland-to-the-supreme-court-sources-say/2016/03/16/3bc90bc8-eb7c-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html?utm_term=.8ef3aa9ac9be\">nominated</a> Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., to replace the late Justice <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/antonin-scalia/\">Antonin Scalia</a>. The same day, <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/statement-judge-merrick-garland\">Baldwin praised Garland</a>, saying he had &quot;strong federal judicial experience.&quot; She said: &quot;I now plan to do my job by reviewing Judge Garland&rsquo;s experience and qualifications for our highest court. I also look forward to meeting with Judge Garland. I hope my Republican colleagues will do the same thing&quot; and give him &quot;fair consideration.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>April 2016:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/14/baldwin-meets-with-obamas-supreme-court-nominee-garland/84901638/\">Baldwin met with Garland</a>, saying it &quot;strengthened my conviction that this is a very well qualified and experienced judge who deserves a hearing and a vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>January 2017: </strong>Garland&rsquo;s nomination <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/merrick-garlands-nomination-to-supreme-court-expires-without-a-senate-hearing-2017-01-03\">expired</a> with the Republican-led Senate refusing to hold a confirmation hearing or vote -- leaving the seat open for Trump to fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Baldwin didn&rsquo;t state a position on Garland&rsquo;s nomination and she met with him, prior to any possibility of confirmation hearings being held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she made a point of saying those not of the same party as the president -- in this case, Republican senators -- should consider Garland&rsquo;s full record, give it &quot;fair consideration&quot; and meet with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would change with the next two nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>2. Neil Gorsuch</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>January 2017:</strong> Trump announced Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Colorado, as his nominee. The same day, Baldwin criticized the choice, saying Gorsuch had a &quot;deeply troubling record. But she also said she would &quot;fully review&quot; the record, meet with Gorsuch and give his nomination <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/statement-on-president-trump-scotus-nomination\">&quot;fair consideration</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, however, Baldwin said she not only <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/02/tammy-baldwin-vote-no-trump-pick-neil-gorsuch-supreme-court/97402842/\">would vote against</a> Gorsuch, she would filibuster the pick by forcing Republicans to meet a 60-vote threshold to confirm him. Baldwin said Gorsuch did not have a &quot;mainstream record&quot; and cited judicial rulings of his on cases involving disabled students, workers and women&rsquo;s reproductive health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>February 2017: </strong><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/02/16/sen-baldwin-meets-gorsuch-restates-her-opposition/98022166/\">Baldwin met with Gorsuch</a> and reiterated her plans to vote against him and to support a filibuster against his nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate held its <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/sep/07/fact-checking-brett-kavanaughs-senate-confirmation/\">confirmation hearing</a> for Gorsuch the next month and he was confirmed by the Senate the following month. To overcome the filibuster, Republicans deployed the so-called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html\">nuclear option</a>, voting to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as she did with Garland, Baldwin met with Gorsuch before his confirmation hearing &nbsp;&mdash; but it&rsquo;s hard to argue that the meeting was part of Baldwin giving &quot;fair consideration&quot; to Gorsuch, since she had already come out against him.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">3. Brett Kavanaugh</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>July 2018:</strong> Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court.html\">nominated</a> Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C. He would replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. The same day, Baldwin said she <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/baldwin-statement-on-nomination-of-judge-brett-kavanaugh-for-supreme-court\">would review his nomination</a> with an eye toward women&rsquo;s health and other issues. Three days later, Baldwin announced she <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/statement-on-scotus-nominee-brett-kavanaugh\">would not support Kavanaugh</a>, saying he was backed by &quot;powerful special interests.&quot; Her statement did not make mention of whether she would meet with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>August 2018: </strong>Baldwin reiterated her plans to vote against Kavanaugh, <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/politics/msnbc-host-presses-baldwin-political-decision-oppose-kavanaugh-meeting/\">but said</a> she <a href=\"https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/tammy-baldwin-attempts-to-put-single-payer-health-care-price/article_a3f59641-ba90-55a7-b19a-c4bdde281905.html\">plans to meet </a>with him. She had not done so, however, before his confirmation hearing, which was held in early September 2018. Her campaign told us that Baldwin&rsquo;s Senate office has reached out to the White House about a meeting but hasn&rsquo;t received a response. However, other Democratic senators <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/democrats-continue-camera-shy-ways-brett-kavanaugh\">have met with Kavanaugh</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin met with Garland, who was nominated by Obama, and urged GOP senators to consider his record and to meet with him. She didn&rsquo;t announce a position on the nomination of Garland, who ultimately was denied a vote by the GOP-controlled Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with Gorsuch, who was nominated by Trump, Baldwin announced her opposition almost immediately -- lessening the value of meeting with him, in terms of giving his nomination consideration, though she did meet with him, prior to his confirmation hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Trump nominee Kavanaugh, Baldwin also announced her opposition almost immediately. She says she plans to meet with him, but no meeting occurred before his confirmation hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin&rsquo;s approach to how she considers Supreme Court nominees has varied in each of the three cases -- with a notable shift for those nominated by a Republican. For a partial change in position, we give her a Half Flip.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-11T14:45:08.036714", "ruling_date": "2018-09-13T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Half Flip: Tammy Baldwin partially shifts position on how she considers U.S. Supreme Court nominees", "ruling_headline_slug": "half-flip-tammy-baldwin-partially-shifts-position-", "ruling_link_text": "Change from Obama nominee to Trump nominees", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt, Sept. 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, White House spokesman Raj Shah, Sept. 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Leah Vukmir campaign spokesman Jahan Wilcox, Sept. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/14/baldwin-meets-with-obamas-supreme-court-nominee-garland/84901638/\">&quot;Baldwin meets with Obama&rsquo;s Supreme Court nominee Garland,&quot;</a> April 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/12/tammy-baldwin-oppose-u-s-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh/776660002/\">&quot;Tammy Baldwin to oppose U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh,&quot;</a> July 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/22/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-changes-views-how-quickly-act-suprem/\">&quot;Tammy Baldwin changes views on how quickly to act on a Supreme Court nomination,&quot;</a> Feb. 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/02/tammy-baldwin-vote-no-trump-pick-neil-gorsuch-supreme-court/97402842/\">&quot;Tammy Baldwin will vote no on Trump pick Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court,&quot;</a> Feb. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/02/16/sen-baldwin-meets-gorsuch-restates-her-opposition/98022166/\">&quot;Sen.
