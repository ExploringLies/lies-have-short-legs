Ted Cruz said in February that &quot;it&rsquo;s been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year,&quot; also saying that not approving a nomination in an election year is a long tradition. It&rsquo;s been 76 years, but these openings are rare, so it&rsquo;s not much of a tradition. We rated Cruz&rsquo;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-supreme-court-nomination-tradition/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also claimed in February that &quot;it&rsquo;s been 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court Justice.&quot; President Ronald Reagan, in his second term, nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy in November 1987. He confirmed Kennedy while still in office in February 1988. We rated Rubio&rsquo;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/14/marco-rubio/rubio-exaggerates-sayig-its-been-80-years-lame-duc/\">Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, turning back the history book once again, we decided to look at Flake&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Checks out </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flake spokesman Jason Samuels emphasized that the Arizona senator&rsquo;s statement included &quot;confirmed by the opposition party&quot; and &quot;vacancy occurred during an election year&quot; when we reached out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samuels referred us to the Senate&rsquo;s list of Supreme Court nominations <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/Nominations.htm\">going back to 1789</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we spoke with generally agreed with Flake&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Flake&rsquo;s statement is &quot;technically correct.&quot; She noted that there are no 20th century examples of a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year that the opposition party in the Senate refused to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only seat left vacant was Sherman Minton&#39;s, who resigned in October 1956, one month before the election. &nbsp;The (Democratic-controlled) Senate had already adjourned for the elections, so (Republican) President Eisenhower gave William Brennan a recess appointment, and he was later nominated and confirmed in 1957,&quot; Binder said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recess appointment isn&rsquo;t the same as submitting a nominee, according to Russell Wheeler, an expert on federal courts at the Brookings Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Eisenhower didn&rsquo;t submit a nominee; he recess appointed Brennan then nominated him the following January. It helped that Brennan was a Democrat,&quot; Wheeler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Justice Kennedy instance aids Flake&rsquo;s statement too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Jeff chose his words very, very carefully. There have been vacancies during election years that were filled -- including Anthony Kennedy -- by an opposition Senate. But the vacancy occurred shortly before the election year,&quot; said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. &quot;Fundamental to this statement is the reality that we have not had a vacancy occurring in an election year with an opposition Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flake said, &quot;One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president&rsquo;s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flake&rsquo;s carefully crafted statement rules out potential exceptions, such as Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s 1988 election year confirmation, but 1987 nomination, or the 1950s case with President Eisenhower and a Democratic Senate in adjournment&nbsp;when a Supreme Court vacancy came up a month before the November election. This seems to be because a vacancy just hasn&rsquo;t happened to occur under these circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Flake&rsquo;s claim as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-14T13:48:30.734008", "ruling_date": "2016-03-14T14:55:01", "ruling_headline": "Arizona senator claims confirming Supreme Court nominees in an election year is rare", "ruling_headline_slug": "arizona-senator-claims-confirming-supreme-court-no", "ruling_link_text": "Specific situation hasn't happened", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sen.
