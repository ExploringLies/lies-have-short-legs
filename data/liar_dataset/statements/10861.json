That&rsquo;s not working out so good for Wisconsinites.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The</em> deciding vote on Obamacare?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same claim has been made against a number of other Democratic senators over the past five years.

Without that move to prevent Republican filibusters, a final vote on the bill would have been blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Invoking cloture requires 60 votes -- and the Democrats got <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00395\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>exactly 60</u></a>. All 58 Democratic senators, including Feingold, along with two independents voted yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day,the Senate passed Obamacare. Obama signed the measure into law in March 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&#39;s spokeswoman, Melinda Schnell, argued to us in an email that all 60 votes for cloture were decisive, because any one of the senators &quot;could have, on her or his own, stopped the measure by voting otherwise.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. But Johnson&#39;s claim is that Feingold cast <em>the</em> deciding vote, not one of 60 votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So was there a single<strong> </strong>deciding senator? Arguably yes, but not Feingold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four days before the cloture vote was held, Senate Democrats <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/12/20/democrats_grab_final_vote_for_health_bill/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>announced</u></a> they had clinched the 60th vote they needed by reaching a compromise with Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, who had concerns about abortion-related provisions in the bill. Nelson even appeared at a news conference to explain his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in the process, according to a detailed <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/24/nation/la-na-health-ticktock24-2009dec24/2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>recounting</u></a> by the Los Angeles Times, reluctant Democratic Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, as well as Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, were persuaded to vote yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, based on accounts in the <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/24/nation/la-na-health-ticktock24-2009dec24/2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Los Angeles Times</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/health/policy/20health.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New York Times</u></a> and the <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/12/20/democrats_grab_final_vote_for_health_bill/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Boston Globe</u></a> -- there is no mention that Feingold&#39;s vote for cloture was ever in doubt. And Johnson didn&rsquo;t cite any evidence that it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A footnote before we close:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A week before the Obamacare cloture vote, Feingold played a pivotal role on a different cloture vote. Republicans threatened to filibuster an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the Obamacare measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get around that, according to the Los Angeles Times, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had to convince Feingold -- an opponent of the defense bill -- not to join the Republican blockade. Feingold agreed to vote with his party. The effect was to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30773.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>advance</u></a> the health care bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson said Feingold &quot;was the deciding vote on Obamacare.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an element of truth in Johnson&#39;s claim. Obamacare backers needed 60 yes votes on a crucial vote in the Senate that paved the way for final Senate passage of the health care reform bill. Feingold cast one of those votes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to call it <em>the</em> deciding vote is misleading in that support from Feingold -- unlike some other senators who had to be persuaded to vote yes -- was never in doubt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Johnson&#39;s statement Mostly False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-21T13:53:59.453744", "ruling_date": "2015-05-27T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Russ Feingold cast deciding vote on Obamacare, Ron Johnson says", "ruling_headline_slug": "russ-feingold-cast-deciding-vote-pave-way-obamacar", "ruling_link_text": "His vote was 1 of 60", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/304192491.html?ipad=y\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Johnson talks 2016 rematch with Feingold,&quot;</u></a> May 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, U.S. Sen.
