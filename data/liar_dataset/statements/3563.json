Then Governor Chafee proposed nearly doubling fees at state beaches. It hit us like a bucket of ice water. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the plan, the price for a season pass would increase to $60 for Rhode Islanders from $30. Daily rates for state residents would jump to $10 from $6 during the week and to $14 from $7 on weekends and holidays. Fees for out-of-staters would also increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile discussing the proposed fees on WJAR-TV&rsquo;s &quot;10 News Conference&quot; on April 3, Richard Licht, director of the Department of Administration, asserted they weren&rsquo;t out of line.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;For $30 more, you are getting a season pass to one of the greatest sets of beaches in the country. &hellip;You still, at $60, are less than some of the town beaches charge &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an inordinate burden on the people of Rhode Island,&quot; Licht said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCould the fees at <a href=\"http://www.riparks.com/listing.htm\">state beaches</a> still be lower than town beaches &mdash; even if doubled?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we inquired where Licht got his information, the governor&rsquo;s spokesman, Michael Trainor, told us we&rsquo;d hear back by the next day. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile we waited, we made some phone calls and found 14 coastal communities that charge admission to their beaches. Most of the beach fees have been set for the season.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike a beach ball on a breezy day, the fees are all over the place. And there are many different categories, covering residents, non-residents and seniors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t (The Chafee administration ultimately referred us to the state Department of Environmental Management, which cited many of the same figures we found in our survey.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to focus on the fee that the majority of state residents -- who don&rsquo;t live in beach communities -- would pay for a season pass or a single day at the shore. If they visit a state beach, they&rsquo;d all pay the new fees. If they visit a town beach, they&rsquo;d pay that community&rsquo;s non-resident fee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most expensive non-resident season pass costs $175 for Little Compton&rsquo;s South Shore Beach. Middletown&rsquo;s Sachuest Beach, also known as Second Beach, charges $140. Next comes Charlestown, at $90. Passes go for $80 at Newport&rsquo;s Easton&rsquo;s Beach and South Kingstown Town Beach and $70 at Wuskenau Town Beach in Westerly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how does the state&rsquo;s proposed $60 season pass compare? Of the eight towns that offer passes to non-residents, the state fee would be less than all but Portsmouth, which collects $50 for a pass to Sandy Point Beach, on the Sakonnet River.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo far, so good for Licht.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what about daily fees? (Remember, we&rsquo;re comparing state fees to local non-resident fees, setting aside favorable pricing for residents.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s begin with weekdays. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chafee administration wants to increase the $6 daily state fee to $10.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree towns -- Warren, Bristol and Tiverton -- charge just $5 per day. Westerly charges $6 and Portsmouth charges $7. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrices are higher at the ocean beaches: $10 in Charlestown, Narragansett, Middletown and Newport; $12 in Little Compton; and $15 a day in South Kingstown and Jamestown. (Narragansett also charges a separate fee to walk onto the beach.) Two towns -- Barrington and North Kingstown -- don&rsquo;t allow non-residents to park at their beaches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the $10 state fee would be less than 5 of the 12 towns that welcome out-of-towners. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn weekends and holidays, the state&rsquo;s new fee would be $14 -- less than fees in 8 of the 12 beach towns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo when Licht says the new state fees are less than &quot;some&quot; of the town beaches, we can&rsquo;t &nbsp;disagree. In fact, the state fees are lower in many instances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t kick any sand at Licht on this one. &nbsp;We rate his claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">True.</a></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-08T18:42:20.105436", "ruling_date": "2011-04-10T00:00:01", "ruling_headline": "Licht says proposed fees for R.I. state beaches are still less than fees at some municipal beaches", "ruling_headline_slug": "licht-says-proposed-fees-ri-state-beaches-are-stil", "ruling_link_text": "Who can put a price on a day at the beach?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTurnto10.com, <a href=\"http://www2.turnto10.com/news/2011/apr/01/licht-defends-chafee-budget-10-news-conference-ar-440349/\">&quot;10 News Conference: April 3, 2011,&quot; </a>accessed on April 4, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interviews with municipal officials and clerks in 15 coastal communities in Rhode Island, April 4-6, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Providence Journal, <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/beach_fees_03-30-11_KIN8NSN_v27.1bd2375.html\">&quot;Day at Beach Less Sunny,&quot;</a> March 30, 2011, accessed on April 5, 2011.
