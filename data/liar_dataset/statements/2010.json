That point was clear during this week&#39;s segment of ABC&#39;s <em>This Week</em>. Talking about stimulus spending and unemployment benefits, the round-table discussion eventually turned to the question of debt and long-term fiscal sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You begin to get in a situation where the interest payments on the debt become unsustainable, the debt becomes unsustainable, and there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty. There&#39;s uncertainty now about the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the impact that&#39;ll have on the economy, the impact on health care, the Obamacare spending, what impact that will have, possible cap and trade. And people are just sitting on the sidelines saying, &#39;Where does this end?&#39;&quot; said Daniel Senor, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Bush administration official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To demonstrate his point, Senor brought up Japan as an example of a country whose debt is unsustainable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I mean, if you look at just the interest payments alone that the Japanese government pays, it accounts for 25 percent -- the interest on its own debt, 25 percent of its national budget,&quot; said Senor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That comment caught the attention of Paul Krugman, a Princeton economist who was also at the round-table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s just not right,&quot; objected Krugman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jake Tapper, the show host, moved the argument along, but not before inviting PolitiFact to act as an objective judge. So we decided to investigate. We&#39;ll leave the debate about Japan&#39;s financial stability to economists, however, and focus on the numbers. Is a quarter of Japan&#39;s budget going solely to the interest payments on its debt?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The details of Japan&#39;s fiscal condition are nicely summarized in a document put out by the Japan Ministry of Finance in February 2010. Page two of the report indicates that Japan spends 22.4 percent of its budget on &quot;national debt servicing.&quot; Debt servicing consists of interest rate payments <em>and </em>bond redemption, which is essentially a repayment of the loan principal. Looking at interest rate expenses alone, that percentage is 10.6 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One can also look at the percentage as compared with the budget that does not include debt-related expenditures. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=%289808.7%2F%2892299.2-20649.1%29%29*100&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=b3ecb06aec28b7b7\" target=\"_blank\">That works</a> out to 13.7 percent. Either way, Senor was off by a significant amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked with Senor, who told us that even if we go with the 13.7 percent, his broader point stands -- Japan&#39;s debt is not sustainable. As we said before, that&#39;s a mess we&#39;ll leave to the economists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal was to see if Senor was using the correct figures, and we found that he wasn&#39;t. Even if we go with the higher of the two figures, Senor missed the target by nearly half. For that, we give him a False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-06T18:16:43.756676", "ruling_date": "2010-07-06T18:14:58", "ruling_headline": "Senor inflates Japan's interest payments", "ruling_headline_slug": "senor-inflates-japans-interest-payments", "ruling_link_text": "13 is the new 25, apparently", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, This Week segment <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-mccain/story?id=11083929&amp;page=4\" target=\"_blank\">transcript</a>, July 4, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJapan Ministry of Finance, <a href=\"http://www.mof.go.jp/english/budget/pamphletjpffs2010s.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese Public Finance Fact Sheet</a>, Feb. 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaul Krugman, Blog post: <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/japanese-interest-payments/\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese Interest Payments</a>, July 4, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE-mail and phone interview, Daniel Senor, Council on Foreign Relations, July 6, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE-mail interview, Raymond Robertson, Macalester College, July 6, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, Daniel Senor <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/bios/14206/daniel_senor.html\" target=\"_blank\">biography page</a>, accessed July 6, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCBS News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20000384-503544.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Senor Could Challenge Gillibrand for Senate Seat</a>, by Stephanie Condon, March 12, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at Council on Foreign Relations", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Daniel", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 502, "last_name": "Senor", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "daniel-senor", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Senor.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/502/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Japan&#39;s &quot;interest on its own debt&quot; is &quot;25 percent of its national budget&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "ABC's 'This Week'", "statement_date": "2010-07-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 151, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/151/", "subject": "This Week - ABC News", "subject_slug": "abc-news-week", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
