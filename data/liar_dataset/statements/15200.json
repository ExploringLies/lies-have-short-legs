Section 4015 stated &quot;a state agency shall be required to use an immigration status verification system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That provision drew scant media attention. Some news stories mentioned in a single sentence that the farm bill banned illegal immigrants, college students, lottery winners and dead people from getting food stamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason the immigration section may not have been a key part of the debate? Federal law already generally banned immigrants in the country illegally from getting food stamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/104/plaws/publ193/PLAW-104publ193.pdf\">Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996</a> restricted access for immigrants to get food stamps. But subsequent legislation restored access for certain immigrants, including refugees and lawful permanent residents with a proven work history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the 2014 farm bill required states to use an immigration status verification system, <a href=\"https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/SNAP%20Questions%20and%20Answers%20Concerning%20the%20Agricultural%20Act%20of%202014%20Sections%204005%2C%204007%2C%204008%2C%204009%2C%204015%2C%204022%2C%204025%2C%204031.pdf\">most states already had procedures</a> in place to meet that requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, which advocates on behalf of low-income people, said the farm bill didn&rsquo;t change <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/snap-policy-non-citizen-eligibility\">immigrant eligibility rules</a> for food and nutrition assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Why DeSantis voted against the farm bill</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The section on immigration wasn&rsquo;t the motivation behind DeSantis&rsquo; vote against the farm bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He voted against the bill because of the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-03-31/farm-bill-costs-are-exploding\">high costs</a>. He believed that the bill failed to overhaul a food stamp program that was growing too large, said campaign spokesman Brad Herold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RepDeSantis/posts/729844280360845\">2014 Facebook post</a>, DeSantis said the farm bill was a &quot;bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms,&quot; such as work requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herold said DeSantis does not believe in granting any form of benefits to immigrants in the country illegally. He has voted&nbsp;in favor of amendments related to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/230\">work requirements</a> for <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/house-amendment/231\">food stamps</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the 2014 farm bill didn&rsquo;t alter the pre-existing policy that illegal benefits are not eligible for SNAP benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Voting against a bill that expanded farm subsidies and failed to enact welfare reforms is not a vote to confer benefits on illegal immigrants,&quot; Herold said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacob Engels, publisher of the Central Florida Post and author of the article inked from the Uncle Sam website, directed PolitiFact to an article by the <a href=\"https://cis.org/North/SNAP-Still-Gives-Preference-Illegals-over-Citizens\">Center for Immigration Studies</a>, an organization that advocates for low levels of immigration. The story was more nuanced, saying that a family that has some citizens and some immigrants in the country illegally could still get some benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Uncle Sam&rsquo;s Misguided Children said that DeSantis &quot;voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article fails to point out that even before the farm bill passed, undocumented immigrants were already generally blocked from getting food stamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The farm bill that DeSantis voted against was a sweeping piece of legislation that mentions immigrants only briefly in the context of requiring states to verify their status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeSantis stated at the time of his vote against the bill that he thought it was a bad deal for taxpayers and failed to rein in the food stamp program. By voting &quot;no&quot; he took a stand against the overall piece of legislation &mdash; that&rsquo;s not evidence that he &quot;voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-29T15:38:01.595798", "ruling_date": "2018-03-29T17:13:56", "ruling_headline": "A ridiculous attack on Ron DeSantis about food stamps and immigrants", "ruling_headline_slug": "misleading-attack-ron-desantis-about-farm-bill-foo", "ruling_link_text": "He opposed a sweeping bill", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Uncle Sam&rsquo;s Misguided Children,<a href=\"https://news.unclesamsmisguidedchildren.com/desantis-voted-in-favor-of-food-stamps-for-illegal-immigrants/\"> &quot;DeSantis voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants,</a>&quot;
