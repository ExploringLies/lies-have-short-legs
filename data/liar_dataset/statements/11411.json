They are seeking to replace longtime Republican incumbent John Watkins, who is not seeking re-election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Sturtevant TV ad features a bike racer pedaling hard while the narrator says Gecker is in &quot;a race to raise your taxes.&quot; Among the ensuing charges is that Gecker &quot;voted&quot; to &quot;double vehicle registration fees, costing us $6 million in one year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We investigated whether Gecker really did vote to double the fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt Brown, campaign manager for Sturtevant, told us the claim is based on Gecker&rsquo;s actions last year, when the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors was considering the county&rsquo;s 2014-15 capital improvement plan and its budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the proposals was to increase the county&rsquo;s $20 car registration fee to $40, to raise $7.5 million for local transportation needs that the state would match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposal was controversial and, at Gecker&rsquo;s request during a supervisors meeting April 23, 2014, it was pulled from the capital improvement plan and voted on separately. The $20 increase passed, 3-2, with Gecker voting against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tape of the meeting shows Gecker offered no explanation at the time of his vote. But about 10 minutes later, he said it should be a higher priority for the county to dedicate long-term revenues for clean-water programs mandated by the federal government than to raise fees for transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gecker did not push for the clean water funding, however, saying he realized his view was in the minority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given Gecker&rsquo;s clear vote against the fee increase, what evidence does Sturtevant offer that his opponent actually voted for it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, in an email, replied that Gecker later that same April day voted for the entire capital improvement plan &mdash; which funds long-term construction projects &mdash; and then for the county&rsquo;s operating budget. The two are connected, because revenues from the car registration fee flow into the county&rsquo;s operating budget and then are allocated to the capital improvement plan. Brown said this counts as two Gecker votes for the raised fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should point out that the 134-page capital improvement plan was filled with line items for projects totaling $848 million over five years. The 208-page operating budget funded $766 million of services, including education, public safety and health programs. Gecker told us that while he didn&rsquo;t agree with every line item, he supported the overall benefits of the spending plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown cited a third vote, as well, that occurred Feb. 26, 2014 &mdash; almost two months before the budget was approved. Gecker concurred in the Chesterfield board&rsquo;s unanimous vote to advertise all fee and tax rate increases being considered in the budget &mdash; including the car registration increase &mdash; and to set a public hearing on them March 26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be noted that this is a required step in budget deliberations and that the mere advertisement of possible tax rate increases doesn&rsquo;t obligate local board or council members ultimately to support them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sturtevant says Gecker &quot;voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing county residents $6 million annually in additional fees.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple truth is just the opposite. When the $20 increase came up for a vote before the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors in April 2014, Gecker opposed it. Despite his opposition, it passed on a 3-2 vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sturtevant, in trying to justify his claim, dismisses this obvious vote. His campaign instead argues that Gecker subsequently voted to pass massive spending plans that fund all of the county&rsquo;s public services and public improvement projects. The new registration fees were a tiny part of these plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sturtevant camp also notes that Gecker, in 2014, voted to advertise that the board was considering the $20 increase. But that&rsquo;s not tantamount to voting in support of the increase. Local governing boards are required to give notice for a public hearing whenever a fee or tax increase is on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep your eye on the ball. Again, the only time the fee increase came up for a direct vote, Gecker opposed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Sturtevant&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-12T11:57:09.354808", "ruling_date": "2015-10-12T11:59:03", "ruling_headline": "Glen Sturtevant says Dan Gecker voted to double car registration fee", "ruling_headline_slug": "glen-sturtevant-says-dan-gecker-voted-double-car-r", "ruling_link_text": "Just the opposite", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sturtevant for Senate flier, &quot;On higher taxes, Dan Gecker says we need flexibility,&quot;
