Chris Christie&rsquo;s recent changes to the state&rsquo;s education policy don&rsquo;t exactly quell rumors that he plans to enter the 2016 GOP presidential field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On May 28, Christie announced the end of the existing Common Core standards in New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;It&#39;s now been five years since Common Core was adopted. And the truth is that it&#39;s simply not working,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating new ones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is not the first time critics have accused Christie of flip-flopping on Common Core -- the state-based educational standards aimed at improving students readiness for college and workplace. (Read our past&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/oct/21/fact-checking-common-core-school-standards/\">fact-checks</a>&nbsp;of claims and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/08/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-change-position-common-core/\">flops</a>&nbsp;relating to Common Core.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Christie&rsquo;s decision to nix Common Core is not unexpected, but it is notable considering his initial stance in support of the standards. &quot;This is one of those areas where I&rsquo;ve agreed more with the the president than not,&quot; Christie said in 2011, a year after he implemented them in New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With an upcoming presidential campaign&nbsp;seeming increasingly likely, we decided to check how Christie&rsquo;s position on Common Core registers on our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/about/\">Flip-O-Meter</a>. It is important to note that we are not passing judgment on decisions to change positions. Rather, we are just determining whether they did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Christie in support of Common Core</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Common Core was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nga.org/cms/home/news-room/news-releases/page_2009/col2-content/main-content-list/title_forty-nine-states-and-territories-join-common-core-standards-initiative.html\">set into motion</a>&nbsp;in June 2009 as a collaboration between 49 states and territories. Christie signed off on the standards, and New Jersey adopted them in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2011, the Christie administration and New Jersey&nbsp;acting Education Commissioner Chris Cerf worked to implement the standards. Christie praised Common Core standards as &quot;a building block in our state&rsquo;s education system meant to ensure that teachers and districts can innovate within a framework of high expectations and accountability.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Common Core Standards were set to be implemented over a three-year period, and the state Department of Education offered 300 presentations within the first year to provide educators with information about the new initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In August 2013, Christie maintained a positive view of the standards. &quot;We&rsquo;re doing Common Core in New Jersey and are going to continue,&quot; he said. He attributed majority Republican opposition to the standards as a &quot;knee-jerk reaction &hellip; that if the president likes something, the Republicans in Congress don&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Christie in opposition to Common Core</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Christie&rsquo;s 180-degree turn on Common Core occurred in slow-motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In December 2014 he said in an NJTV interview, &quot;I have real concerns about the Common Core.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then in February 2015, he expressed &quot;grave concerns about the way this has been done, especially the way the (Obama) administration has tried to implement it through tying federal funding to these things.&quot; Christie stated publicly that Common Core was &quot;in the midst of re-examination&quot; in New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/25/joe-leibham/federal-government-required-states-adopt-common-co/\">fact-checked</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/30/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-wants-nationalize-curricu/\">several</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/24/sondy-pope/how-much-federal-government-involved-common-core-s/\">claims</a>&nbsp;that Common Core is a federal program or mandate. It&rsquo;s not. Rather, Christie is referring to the Obama administration using the promise of federal funding to incentivize adoption of Common Core standards. But, despite improving the state&rsquo;s chances of winning federal money if they adopt educational standards, Common Core itself remains a state-based, voluntary program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nonetheless, on May 28, 2015, Christie made the full switch, saying the standards have &quot;brought confusion and frustration to parents. I&rsquo;ve heard it every day. It&rsquo;s brought distance between our teachers and the communities where they work, and instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating morale problems in those classrooms and at home.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Christie&rsquo;s spokesperson pointed to a document released prior to the governor&rsquo;s speech on May 28, 2015. The document outlines various efforts Christie made throughout 2014 to canvass the state&rsquo;s educators and parents about their experiences with Common Core after its three-year implementation that began in 2011. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In July 2014 he&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/552014/approved/20140714a.html\">established</a>&nbsp;a study commission to review, among other student assessments,&nbsp;Common Core. Then, in November 2014, Christie announced that he was in the midst of evaluating the Core&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Christie attributed his change of heart in May 2015 to the negative feedback he received from the aforementioned study commission and educators&rsquo; reviews. In an interview on June 7 on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-june-7-2015-christie-de-blasio/\">CBS&rsquo;s <em>Face the Nation</em></a>, Christie said, &quot;I&rsquo;m changing because I gave it four years to work &hellip; but in four years, we did not have educators or parents buy into the Common Core.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, there is one element of the standard&rsquo;s implementation he&rsquo;s not phasing out:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/education/assessment/\">PARCC testing</a>. Christie has said PARCC testing will continue, and those tests were developed in line with Common Core standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;PARCC is a set of assessments meant to test progressions to the standards,&quot; stated Ashley Jochim, who studies Common Core at the Center for Reinventing Public Education. She added, &quot;the tests have been developed separately but are meant to align with the Common Core.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Christie was a supporter of Common Core, but five years following its implementation he has become a critic. He attributes his changed stance to negative reviews from educators and parents within the state. We rate his change of position a Full Flop.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-24T11:53:14.082045", "ruling_date": "2015-06-24T15:26:16", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie says parent and teacher complaints prompted change on Common Core", "ruling_headline_slug": "christie-says-parent-and-teacher-complaints-prompt", "ruling_link_text": "Says he changed after hearing parent and teacher complaints", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPxeCWBD6fg\">Gov.
