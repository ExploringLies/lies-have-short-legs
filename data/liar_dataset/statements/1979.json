He pointed to a program created  during his days as DeKalb County's chief executive officer. In July  2005, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners approved Jones' plan to  convert methane gas into electricity from one of its landfills and sell  it to Georgia Power.<br /><br />\"I have a record on the environment of  creating green energy by capturing methane gas at our landfills and  selling it to Georgia Power and they in return selling it back as green  energy -- taking trash and turning it into cash,\" Jones told the  audience at the June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta.<br /><br />It's  been five years since the county government signed on with Georgia  Power. So we decided to take a look at the initiative and see how it's  working out. Is DeKalb, as Jones claimed, \"taking trash and turning it  into cash\"?<br /><br />First, a brief explanation on how this works.  Landfill gas is largely composed of methane and carbon dioxide. By  burning gas in boilers, Georgia Power can produce steam for power  generation, according to its Web site. The company said the landfills  can produce as many as 8 megawatts of electric power, enough to power  eight Super Wal-Marts. More than 500 agencies across the nation have  similar programs. DeKalb is doing it at the Seminole landfill, located  near the county's southern edge.<br /><br />The environment is a big issue  for Jones, who was CEO from 2001 through 2008. Jones won several awards  for his efforts to preserve more green space in the county, primarily  through a $125 million bond referendum that voters approved in 2001.<br /><br />Jones  is also hoping to capitalize on a major concern in Georgia --  unemployment. His campaign slogan is \"Jobs First,\" and Jones is trying  to convince voters that some of his economic development efforts, like  the gas to energy program, are reasons why they should give him a shot  in Washington. The state's unemployment rate in May was 10.2 percent. It  was 9.5 percent a year earlier.<br /><br />In 2006, the county built a  facility to convert the gas to electricity at a cost of $5.3 million.  DeKalb has since spent $1.6 million on maintenance and operations,  county spokeswoman Angela Walton said.<br /><br />And how much has DeKalb  collected from the program? Walton said $3.9 million thus far. DeKalb  projects it will collect nearly $1.1 million this year and slightly more  in 2011.<br /><br />Some environmental protection groups, such as the  Sierra Club, dispute the potential profit margin for DeKalb and other  facilities that convert gas to electricity. They said the operating  costs will eventually exceed profits when governments spend more money  to pay for the environmental impact of methane -- which has high global  warming potential -- leaking during the conversion process. (The Sierra  Club said a higher percentage of methane leaks into the atmosphere when  you convert gas to electricity.) The Sierra Club's board of directors  voted last year to oppose the creation of any new landfill gas-to-energy  facilities.<br /><br />\"Methane is a dangerous gas that needs to be  controlled,\" said Mark Woodall, the Sierra Club's Georgia chapter  chairman. \"It doesn't need to be regarded as the answer to all renewable  energy needs.\"<br /><br />For the record, the Sierra Club has endorsed the  incumbent congressman, Hank Johnson, in this race. <br /><br />Since 2006,  DeKalb has spent about $6.9 million on the gas-to-electricity program.  It has collected $3.9 million in revenue in that time span, with an  estimated $2.1 million on the way in the next two years.<br /><br />Most  business ventures have start-up costs, and DeKalb had some in this  project. The revenue is on pace to soon exceed the start-up costs and  expenses. DeKalb is, Jones said, converting \"trash into cash.\" We rate  this claim as Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-29T16:33:18.122277", "ruling_date": "2010-06-30T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jones says he helped turn \"trash into cash.\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "jones-says-he-helped-turn-trash-cash", "ruling_link_text": "Jones says he turned green energy into gold for DeKalb", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia jobless rate dips again, June 18,  2010<br /><br />E-mail from DeKalb County spokeswoman Angela Walton, June  16, 2010<br /><br />Georgia Power Web <a href=\"http://www.georgiapower.com/green/methane.asp\" target=\"_blank\">site</a>.<br /><br />Interview  with Mark Woodall, Sierra Club Georgia chapter chairman, June 22, 2010<br /><br />Sierra  Club <a href=\"http://www.sierraclub.org/policy/conservation/landfill-gas-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on Landfill-Gas-To-Energy, Jan. 5, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Vernon", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 478, "last_name": "Jones", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "vernon-jones", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/vernonjones.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/478/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\"I have a record on the environment of creating green energy ... taking  trash and turning it into cash.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a candidate forum", "statement_date": "2010-06-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Vernon", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 478, "last_name": "Jones", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "vernon-jones", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/vernonjones.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/478/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
