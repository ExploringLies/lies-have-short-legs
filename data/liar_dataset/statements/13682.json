A full third of them are kids under 12 years old.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellison, who is vying to lead the Democratic National Committee, accurately cited data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We previously explored the demographic makeup of Syrian refugees when Trump, as a candidate, made <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-syrian-refugees-are-mostly-men/\">false</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-refugees-migrants-are-mo/\">claims</a> that most <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/06/scott-walker/federal-government-doesnt-give-information-syrian-/\">Syrian refugees</a> were actually strong men.

About 17 percent relocated to Egypt, Jordan, Iraq or Lebanon are boys and about 16 percent are girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know if the demographics were similar for the larger pool of 2.8 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. They are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Turkey, about 70 percent of registered Syrian refugees are women of all ages and males under 18. About 30 percent are children under 12 years old, <a href=\"https://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=224\">according to data last updated Jan. 12</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women of all ages and boys under 12 years old represent about 62 percent of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A demographic report for the estimated 29,000 refugees in North Africa (Egypt included in other UNHCR report) was not available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geoffrey Mock,&nbsp;Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, said there&#39;s a large Syrian community in Libya and that it&#39;s likely many Syrian refugees there have not been registered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flow of Syrians to Libya after 2011 has been much greater than 29,000, Mock said. Syrian refugees have also gone to Tunisia, though the number there is <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/561e4fef6.pdf\">less than 1,000</a> registered Syrian refugees according to a UNHCR fact sheet, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States accepted 12,587 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 (Oct. 1, 2015-Sept. 30, 2016) and fewer than 2,000 in fiscal 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to that, the most Syrian refugees the Obama administration had accepted was 105,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wrapsnet.org/admissions-and-arrivals/\">according to data</a>&nbsp;from the State Department&#39;s Refugee Processing Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ireports.wrapsnet.org/Interactive-Reporting/EnumType/Report?ItemPath=/rpt_WebArrivalsReports/MX%20-%20Arrivals%20for%20a%20Demographic%20Profile\">a breakdown</a>&nbsp;of fiscal year 2016 admissions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Total: 12,587</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Male: 6,571</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Female: 6,016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Boys and girls under 14 years old: 6,118 (about 48.61 percent of admissions)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellison said, &quot;About three-quarters of (Syrian refugees) are women and children.
