Trainor, &nbsp;aired on Sept. 1, 2011 on WPRO&rsquo;s &quot;The Buddy Cianci Show.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause it wasn&rsquo;t the first time that Cianci had made the comment -- and because a bankruptcy judge had &quot;discharged&quot; most of Trainor&rsquo;s debt nearly a year ago -- we thought it was worth looking into.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrainor has built a career in public relations representing some of the state&rsquo;s high-profile politicians and corporate players. He was an advisor and spokesman for Lincoln Chafee during Chafee&rsquo;s successful 2010 run for governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Trainor has had his own public relations problems ever since it became known late last year that he and a business partner from Connecticut defaulted on a $250,000 federal small business loan granted through the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the EDC and bankruptcy court documents, &nbsp;here&rsquo;s what happened:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe duo and two of their partners started a Rhode Island company, called Genesis Distribution &amp; Marketing, in 2006 to distribute and market retractable window screens and hurricane shutters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrainor and his partners had already bought a company in Connecticut that distributed and installed hurricane shutters. And they planned to buy three more in the South that made the shutters. In January 2007, the EDC loaned &nbsp;the business $250,000 through the federally funded Small Business Loan Fund to buy inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment and hire three employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the business was short-lived.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust two months after receiving the EDC loan, the partners fell behind on their payments. In 2008, the company folded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrainor and his partner from Connecticut, who had pledged their homes as collateral for the loan, talked with representatives from the EDC about a settlement. But the talks broke off in August 2009, when Trainor notified the agency that he was filing for bankruptcy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy then, the housing market had tanked along with the value of Trainor&rsquo;s house. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe partners had repaid $36,326 of the loan; with interest and late fees, the debt on the loan at the time totaled $250,723.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn September 2010, a bankruptcy judge granted Trainor&rsquo;s petition for Chapter 7 <a href=\"http://bankruptcy.is/\">bankruptcy.</a><br />\r\n\tAn explanation of the ruling in the bankruptcy court documents states: &quot;The chapter 7 discharge order eliminates a debtor&#39;s legal obligation to pay a debt that is discharged.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe EDC loan was written off on Nov. 30, 2010. The agency concluded that it couldn&rsquo;t recover any money from its lien on Trainor&rsquo;s home because the mortgage balance exceeded the property&rsquo;s value.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn December, 2010, Trainor, who was being considered for a job in the Chafee administration, told <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/TRAINOR_LOAN_12-02-10_VAL8D68_v50.3c00c29.html\">The Providence Journal</a> that he had not walked away from his obligations, saying he&rsquo;d like to negotiate a settlement with the EDC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernor Chafee discussed Trainor&rsquo;s situation on Channel 12 &quot;Newsmakers&quot; in December 2010, saying that there would be an effort made to repay the EDC. &quot;[We&rsquo;ll] make sure Mike does that,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it certainly sounded then as though Chafee and even Trainor himself believed that Trainor still owed the EDC the money. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChafee hired Trainor as spokesman when he took office in January, a job that paid $129,235.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat month, Trainor also repaid the state $20,788.75 in taxes -- which were not &nbsp;dischargeable in the bankruptcy -- owed on his failed business. In return, the state Division of Taxation removed the lien on his property.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSix months later, in July, the bank sold his house at a foreclosure auction.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTrainor served seven months as Chafee&rsquo;s spokesman before he was transferred, in August, to the Department of Higher Education. His salary has dropped to $88,177.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, does he still owe the $250,000, as Cianci claims?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That debt was discharged,&rsquo;&rsquo; Andrew S. Richardson, a lawyer and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee in the Trainor case, said. &quot;(He) can no longer be forced to pay the obligation -- nor can the creditor take any steps to try and collect it.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, Richardson said, there&rsquo;s no legal obligation that Trainor repay the loan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut other lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy see it differently.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Most people understand (bankruptcy) as destroying the debt &hellip; but technically the discharge in bankruptcy doesn&rsquo;t destroy the debt at all,&rsquo;&rsquo; Jason Kilborn, a lawyer, law professor and resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Virginia said. &quot;It does not destroy the obligation from a moral or even a legal obligation. It just prevents the creditors from collecting on that debt.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.abiworld.org//AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home\">The American Bankruptcy Institute</a> was founded in 1982 to provide Congress and the public with unbiased analysis of bankruptcy issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, the debt remains, even though the creditors are forced to write it off as uncollectable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo if the debt remains but Trainor isn&rsquo;t obligated to repay it, does he really &quot;owe&quot; the state money?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Cianci and challenged him on his use of the term &quot;owes.&quot; &nbsp;Trainor&rsquo;s bankruptcy discharge, he maintained, doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Trainor still owes the EDC the $250,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Maybe it was discharged,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, &quot;but in the mind of the taxpayer who fronted the 250 grand? Yeah, he still owes it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSaid Richardson, the trustee: &quot;I think it depends on whose point of view you&rsquo;re looking at, the creditor or the debtor.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe agree.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPractically speaking, the bankruptcy ruling and the fact that the mortgage on the Trainor&rsquo;s home exceeded its value made it impossible for the EDC to recoup its money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut even after the debt was discharged in bankruptcy Trainor and Chafee both said they&rsquo;d make an effort made to repay the EDC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter all, a debt can be owed even if it&rsquo;s never collected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that reason, we rule Cianci&rsquo;s statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-09T19:08:08.778384", "ruling_date": "2011-09-11T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Cianci says Chafee staffer Michael Trainor still owes $250,000 to R.I.", "ruling_headline_slug": "cianci-says-chafee-staffer-michael-trainor-still-o", "ruling_link_text": "The debt was never repaid", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.projo.com/economy/TRAINOR_LOAN_12-02-10_VAL8D68_v50.3c00c29.html\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.004060219177385305\">The Providence Journal, </a>&quot;Chafee advisor and partners defaulted on $250,000 EDC loan,&rsquo;&rsquo; Dec. 2, 2010, accessed Sept. 2, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/trainor_job_12-30-10_GFLN6KC_v11.3492ee.html\">The Providence Journal,</a> &quot;Chafee to retain his spokesman,&quot; Dec.30, 2010, accessed Sept. 1, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.projo.com/generalassembly/political_scene_5_09-05-11_V6Q3DTB_v26.7133f.html\">The Providence Journal</a>, &quot;Political Scene: Governor&rsquo;s staff continue to grow,&rsquo;&rsquo; Sept. 5, 2011, accessed Sept. 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChannel 12 &quot;NewsMakers&quot; interview with Governor Chafee, December 2010, accessed Sept. 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mails,Melissa Chambers, spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corp., Sept. 2, 6, 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews,Michael F.
