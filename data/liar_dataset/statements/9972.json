Scott Walker is returning to a theme that&rsquo;s been a constant in his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW2kSHJnRgE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">TV ad</a>, the first-term Republican governor peers into the camera and declares: &quot;Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker then asks: &quot;What are you going to do with your savings?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of regular-lookin&rsquo; folks enthusiastically answer: Buy clothes and school supplies, buy 96 gallons of gas, new truck tires, 2,700 diapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke has criticized Walker&rsquo;s tax cuts as tilted to the rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/25/mary-burke/scott-walker-cut-taxes-rich-raised-them-families-m/\">Half True</a> her claim that Walker cut &quot;taxes for the wealthiest&quot; and raised taxes &quot;on 140,000 Wisconsin families.&quot; That claim left out important information, namely that Walker has also cut income taxes across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what about Walker&rsquo;s claim of $322 in savings for an &quot;average family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Walker spokesman Tom Evenson for back up for the $322 figure, he pointed to a series of income tax cuts and property tax relief policies enacted by Walker and GOP lawmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evensen said the figure is based on an &quot;average family&quot; as having four people and a median household income of $81,000. The time frame for the claimed savings, he said, is the 2014 tax year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census figures show that a family of four in Wisconsin has a median income of that amount, or slightly higher. A family of four is a common measuring stick. About one in five family households in Wisconsin is that size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But according to the census bureau, a family of two is much more common, making up almost half of those households. There are also more three-person households than four-person ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More notably, we found the median income across all family sizes in Wisconsin is lower than what Walker used -- $65,618. Because it&rsquo;s a broader figure, it&rsquo;s arguably a more representative &quot;average family&quot; income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To figure out a typical tax cut for a typical Wisconsin family, the $65,618 figure would be the income figure to use, &nbsp;said Tamarine Cornelius, analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this plays out under both scenarios. We&rsquo;ll break our calculations into the two major parts -- property taxes and income taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Property taxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Special injections of state property tax relief provided in the form of aid to schools &nbsp;and technical colleges helped drop the property tax bill for a median-valued home taxed at statewide average rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That hypothetical, &quot;average&quot; property owner will see a decrease of $151 on the 2014 property tax bill compared to what they would have without the relief measures, according to estimates from the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not every family at the average income level will see that savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For one thing, not every family owns a home or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while the Fiscal Bureau estimate is widely cited by both parties as an illustration of &nbsp;changes in property taxes statewide, the bottom line on tax changes can vary widely depending on a variety of factors at the municipal level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Income taxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Walker&rsquo;s &quot;average family&quot; income figure of $81,000, the income tax cuts enacted under Walker would top $200 in 2014, based on our reading of the <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/sendem/LegislativeMemos/LFB%20memo%20to%20Sen%20%20Shilling%20re%20Distributional%20Information%20on%20Individual%20Income%20Tax%20Rate%20Reduction%20(7%2028%2014).pdf\">Fiscal Bureau&rsquo;s analysis</a> of two income tax rate reductions enacted under Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the $65,618 income figure, the average tax owed would drop more than $185.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining the two types of tax cuts shows a reduction of more than $330 in 2014 for a property-owning family at the median income level for Wisconsin families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the higher &quot;average family&quot; income for four people -- the one cited by Walker -- pushes the average savings over $350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, the figures support the ad&rsquo;s claim of $322.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker tells TV viewers that &quot;Thanks to our reforms, the average family will have an extra $322 to spend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using some solid sources, the governor accurately pegs the combined estimated savings for a median-income family from his income- and property-tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim needs clarification, though, because not every average family is in circumstances to receive a cut of that size, particularly if they are not property owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-26T14:29:46.629823", "ruling_date": "2014-09-26T13:54:33", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says tax cuts amount to $322 for average family ", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-tax-cuts-amount-322-average-fami", "ruling_link_text": "Being a homeowner is key", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Walker campaign TV ad, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW2kSHJnRgE&amp;list=UUEeJwPqSAkPNxIR-HZ89fvw\">&quot;Savings,&quot;</a> Sept. 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Tamarine Cornelius, research analyst, Wisconsin Budget Project, Sept. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Tom Evenson, Walker campaign spokesman, Sept. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Fred Ammerman, program supervisor, Transportation and Property Tax Relief section, Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Sept. 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Rob Reinhardt, program supervisor, Tax Policy, Children and Families and Workforce Development section, Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Sept. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislative Fiscal Bureau, &quot;Distributional Information on Individual Income Tax Rate Reduction,&quot;
