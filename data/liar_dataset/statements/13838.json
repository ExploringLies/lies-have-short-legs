Speaking on MSNBC, Sanders said the House plan isn&rsquo;t really a health care plan at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a tax cut package, he says, that overwhelmingly helps the wealthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look at it as a tax plan with $275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more,&quot; Sanders said on <em><a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5057703?21\">All In With Chris Hayes</a></em> March 8. He said the change amounted to a transfer of wealth from working families to the wealthiest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; office told us they got their tax numbers from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional committee that lawmakers rely on for core fiscal data. The committee estimated the impact of repealing two taxes on the wealthy in the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One is a <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4988\">0.9 percent payroll tax on earnings</a> and the other is a <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4984\">3.8 percent tax on net investment income</a> for individuals with incomes over $200,000 and couples with incomes over $250,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the decade between 2017 and 2026, the committee said dropping both measures would cut taxes by $274.9 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tax Policy Center, a joint fiscal analysis project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, confirmed Sanders&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/big-tax-changes-house-gop-health-plan\">number for the total tax cut</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two caveats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Sanders&rsquo; fixation on the top 2 percent is not quite right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the latest survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, households making <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-finc/finc-07.html\">$250,000 and above</a> accounted for the top 4.4 percent. Sanders&rsquo; office cited an <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/2017/01/12/clemente-pollack-obamacare-repeal-helps-rich-hurts-poor/96493130/\">op-ed</a> from two advocacy groups that asserted that those making that much fell into the top 2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, said Sanders left out a couple of &quot;nuances.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House Republican plan&nbsp;includes other forms of tax relief that will benefit a broader swath of Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Repealing ACA taxes delivers small tax cuts to most people throughout the income distribution,&quot; Mermin said. Plus, he added, removing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance would benefit people regardless of income, though for low and moderate income families, &quot;the overall average impact is small,&quot; Mermin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said that the Republican House health care plan would cut taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent by $275 billion. While Sanders didn&rsquo;t specify the time frame, that is a 10-year estimate from a neutral congressional committee. Estimates that look a decade ahead are typical in budgeting circles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one point where Sanders erred most was in labeling the affected taxpayers as the &quot;top 2 percent.&quot; According to government data, a more accurate number is 4.4 percent. But that&rsquo;s still a small sliver of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-09T15:09:25.815396", "ruling_date": "2017-03-09T15:48:02", "ruling_headline": "Sanders: GOP health care plan gives wealthiest a $275 billion tax break", "ruling_headline_slug": "sanders-gop-health-care-plan-gives-wealthiest-275-", "ruling_link_text": "Makes those wallets healthier", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>MSNBC, <em><a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5057703?21\">All In With Chris Hayes</a></em>, March 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Republican Leadership, <a href=\"https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/\">Introducing the American Health Care Act</a>, accessed March 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joint Committee on Taxation, <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4984\">Description of budget reconciliation legislative recommendation relating to repeal of the net investment income tax</a>, March 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joint Committee on Taxation, <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4988\">Estimated revenue effects of budget reconciliation legislative recommendations relating to repeal and replace of certain health-related tax policy provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act</a>, March 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/big-tax-changes-house-gop-health-plan\">The big tax changes in the House GOP health plan</a>, March 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-finc/finc-07.html\">Family Income in 2015</a>, accessed March 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361\">The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2013</a>, June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/income-rank/\">How close are you to the top 1%?</a>, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today</em>, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/11/obamacare-repeal-helps-rich-hurts-poor-column/96371652/\">How Obamacare repeal helps rich, hurts poor: Column</a>, Jan. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Gordon Mermin, senior research associate, Tax Policy Center, March 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Michael Briggs, communications director, Office of Sen.
