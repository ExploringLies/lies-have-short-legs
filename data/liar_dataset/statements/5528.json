Calling the super PACs&rsquo; impact &quot;scandalous,&quot; the lawyer and former Texas House member said: &quot;In our race on the Republican side, already, there are four super PACs -- four super PACs -- and it is a distortion of our democracy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuch PACs are weighing in heavily this election season, raising eyebrows in some cases because they can accept money from certain tax-exempt groups that don&rsquo;t have to disclose their donors&rsquo; names. According to the nonpartisan research group Center for Reponsive Politics&rsquo; <a href=\"http://opensecrets.org/\">opensecrets.org</a>, super PACs have <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/superpacs.php\">spent $65 million</a> in the 2012 cycle so far supporting presidential candidates -- including President Barack Obama, who as PolitiFact noted February 7, 2012, executed a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/07/barack-obama/obama-campaign-says-officials-will-now-appear-supe/\">Full Flop</a> in his stance on fundraising for super PACs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut four in our little ol&rsquo; U.S. Senate race?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJeff Rotkoff, spokesman for Sadler&rsquo;s campaign to succeed retiring Sen.

The FEC <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\">website</a> displays those memos for three of the PACs that Sadler referred to.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the fourth, we asked Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller to confirm its super PAC status. Keller told us by email that the club&rsquo;s Action PAC is its super PAC, distinct from its traditional Club for Growth PAC, which Keller said has endorsed Ted Cruz.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, yep: All four are supers. We set out to learn what we could about their activities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom websites and what the four PACs had reported to the FEC through March 6, 2012, we gleaned these thumbnails, keeping in mind that only the Club for Growth super PAC has existed long enough to have filed reports of contributions and expenditures:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:13px;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">\r\n\t\t<strong>Texas Conservatives Fund</strong>: Created in January 2012 by Paul Kilgore, according to its <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00510941\">statement of organization</a> filed with the FEC.
