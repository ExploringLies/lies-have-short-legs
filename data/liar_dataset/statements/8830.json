Rick Scott may have signed a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/nov/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-cut-k-12-13-billion-/\">$1.3 billion cut to K-12 education</a> in his first year, but he&rsquo;s now touting &quot;record&quot; funding for public schools and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/may/01/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-every-florida-teacher-gets-pay-rai/\">teacher pay raises</a> later in his term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott unveiled his education budget proposal at a Delray Beach elementary school on Jan. 27, 2014. In an accompanying <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/news/2014/2014_01_27.asp\">press release</a>, he said, &quot;The $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered: If the state Legislature goes along with Scott&rsquo;s request, would $18.8 billion in total -- including the state&rsquo;s portion of $10.6 -- be the highest in Florida history? Let&rsquo;s pull out our calculators and budget documents from past years and find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Total dollars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott made <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/feb/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-budget-proposal-has-highest-st/\">similar</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/mar/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-his-education-plan-third-state-st/\">claims </a>about proposing record K-12 education spending last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine whether a budget proposal is a &quot;record,&quot; we have to examine the total size of the pot, the state portion and the per-pupil spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Education Finance Program, the main source of dollars for K-12 education, is by law a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars called the &quot;required local effort,&quot; with an amount dictated by the state. In some recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, Scott signed a budget that included <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/fefp/pdf/fefpdist.pdf\">$18.3 billion</a> for K-12 education, including the state&rsquo;s contribution of $10.5 billion for 2013-14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott&rsquo;s $18.8 billion proposal for 2014-15 -- including $10.6 billion in state dollars -- would be an increase by about <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2014/01/scott-proposes-542-million-increase-to-education-spending.html\">$542 million</a> in raw dollars. (Of course, we&rsquo;ll have to wait to see if the Legislature goes along with that plan when it convenes in March.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t fully answer the question about whether Scott is on track for record K-12 education spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Per-pupil spending</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because another way to compare education funding over time is to look at per-pupil spending. Scott&rsquo;s budget request equals $6,949 per student, compared with&nbsp;$6,780 this year. That means Scott requested a per-pupil increase of about $169. (That&rsquo;s an estimate, since we don&rsquo;t know yet how many more or fewer students the state will have next year.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem for Scott is that $6,949 per student is not a record for per pupil spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chart comparing state spending over a decade through Scott&rsquo;s recommendation last year show that per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 -- before the recession -- at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/1r6kzU6bTZMP4djy3pmBslCKebVDaZetswhaMDjV5X_gMbpn1BoluVa7mQHyD/edit\"><u>$7,126</u></a>. At the time, Charlie Crist was governor; he was then a Republican and is now running as a Democrat against Scott to win his old job back. In 2007-08 Florida had about 67,000 fewer students than it does today, and the state&nbsp;spent more money per student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inflation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to measure whether Scott is proposing a record amount of spending is to&nbsp;use an inflation calculator, in order to fairly compare amounts spent during different years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we take the $9.7 billion in state spending for 2007-08 and <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">adjust for inflation</a>, it would equal about $10.5 billion in 2013 -- so Scott would still be correct that his proposed $10.6 billion in state spending is higher. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; Consumer Price Index inflation calculator doesn&rsquo;t show 2014 yet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if we take the total spending for 2007-08 -- $18.75 billion -- and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">adjust for inflation</a>,&nbsp;that would equal $20.29 billion in 2013, which is still higher than Scott&rsquo;s recommendation for total spending of $18.8 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott said of his budget proposal that &quot;the $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is correct that both the sheer dollar total and the state&rsquo;s portion are larger than in past years. However, per-pupil spending was higher under Crist. Also, factoring in inflation for the total amount for 2007-08 would make it larger than Scott&rsquo;s current proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate Scott&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-28T15:07:57.261326", "ruling_date": "2014-01-29T14:42:42", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott says his K-12 education budget proposal is highest in Florida's history", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-says-his-k-12-education-budget-proposal", "ruling_link_text": "In sheer dollars yes but not in per pupil", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Florida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/news/2014/2014_01_27.asp\">Press release announcing Gov.
