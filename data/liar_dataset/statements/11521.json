Marco Rubio portrayed Hillary Clinton as lying about the circumstances of the Benghazi attack when she said the attacks were the result of an anti-Muslim video instead of al-Qaida-like terrorists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was not a single person on the ground in Benghazi who believed that it was a spontaneous uprising,&quot; he said in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RUUD88oLHM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview on CNN</u></a> on Oct. 29, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN&rsquo;s Chris Cuomo asked Rubio how it could be a lie if the CIA told Clinton it was due to a demonstration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio replied: &quot;She consistently, privately told people, over and over again, including in the early aftermath of it, that this was led by al-Qaida-like elements. There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that<strong> </strong>this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on, irrespective of what the administration is telling you now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to fact-check what Rubio said about what the CIA understood, drawing on the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/12/hillary-clinton/clinton-there-have-been-7-benghazi-probes-so-far/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>seven congressional investigations</u></a> that followed, as well as news articles provided by Rubio and testimony by officials that the Clinton campaign sent us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found is a very murky situation. It seems like there were indications early on that the attacks were not the result of simple protests. But also early on, some in the government did seem to think that demonstrations over the video were a factor. That constitutes something of a &quot;shred,&quot; contrary to what Rubio said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Timeline of reports about what prompted the attacks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To try to sort out the evidence, we created a timeline to show when information was shared about the reason for the attacks.

Four Americans die in the attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sept. 11, 2012: </strong>Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met with Defense Department officials a couple hours after the attack &quot;to discuss the Benghazi attack and other violence in the region in reaction to the anti-Muslim video,&quot; according to a <a href=\"http://www.collins.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/81d5e2d9-cc8d-45af-aa8b-b937c55c7208/Flashing%20Red-HSGAC%20Special%20Report%20final.pdf#page=6\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> from the bipartisan Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.

The first said the U.S. facilities were under attack, while the second linked the attacks to Ansar al-Sharia.

Meanwhile, analysts &quot;received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi.&quot; Fourteen of those reports were issued from the Open Source Center (a CIA intelligence center), while the rest came from the CIA, the Defense Department and the NSA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/press/benghazi.pdf#page=34\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>found issues</u></a> with the reports because they included information from early news reports, not just original intelligence.

We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. ... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rubio campaign evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for whether there was never&nbsp;&quot;a single shred of evidence&quot; presented that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the attack was spontaneous despite what Clinton said, a&nbsp;spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to news articles in conservative media about what Clinton and the former acting CIA director <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/31/former-cia-chief-analysts-never-said-the-video-was-a-factor-in-the-benghazi-attacks/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Michael Morell</u></a> said about the attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in an Oct. 23, 2015,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/23/diary-entry-from-benghazi-victims-dad-gave-hillary-hug-blamed-filmmaker/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fox News report</u></a>, Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods, who died in the Benghazi attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton on Sept. 14, 2012. The two spoke at a ceremony when the victims&rsquo; bodies were flown back to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son,&quot; the entry said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Morell&rsquo;s 2015 book<em> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=yqmdBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177&amp;lpg=PT177&amp;dq=the+demonstration+and+violence+in+Cairo+were+sparked+by+people+upset+over+a+YouTube+video&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w6LNylxvNj&amp;sig=25ArHXjFq9cruPRysdt7PY9T4RE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwA2oVChMI9_3Al-P0yAIVC5UeCh0aVQY7#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20demonstration%20and%20violence%20in%20Cairo%20were%20sparked%20by%20people%20upset%20over%20a%20YouTube%20video&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Great War of Our Time</u></a></em>, Morell wrote, &quot;Still others might have been motivated by the video -- although I should note our analysts never said the video was a factor in the Benghazi attacks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clinton campaign evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign also pointed to statements made by government officials who described initial confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think that the first week after 9/11, there was significant uncertainty about what had happened and disagreement among key people who shaped opinion,&quot; State Department Office Director for Maghreb Affairs <a href=\"http://askedandanswered-democrats.benghazi.house.gov/question.php?q_id=5\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>William Roebuck</u></a> told the Democratic Staff Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in August 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to the confusion was that the Benghazi attack occurred around the same time as protests over the anti-Muslim video in Cairo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was some confusion about have you had -- was this the same thing, were these two incidents the same, were they different?&quot; Roebuck said. &quot;The interagency was trying to sort that out. They were also trying to sort out the conflicting information from Benghazi itself. ... Like I said, there was a dispute among people who were looking very carefully at all of the evidence on the ground, and there was a legitimate disagreement about what had sort of been the precursor to the attack.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said on CNN, &quot;There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was some initial confusion about what sparked the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. Although investigations showed that some officials thought it was a terrorist attack immediately, there at least appeared to be some question about whether the video could have played a role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio exaggerates when he said there wasn&rsquo;t a &quot;single shred of evidence.&quot; There were several suggestions that it was because of a protest. However, he has a point that much of the early evidence pointed strongly to terrorism. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d256b515-5bde-440a-9f3b-6f423cf6741c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d256b515-5bde-440a-9f3b-6f423cf6741c</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-04T13:16:04.611254", "ruling_date": "2015-11-04T15:46:10", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio said there was never evidence that the attacks on Benghazi were spontaneous", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-portrays-hillary-clinton-liar-her-stat", "ruling_link_text": "There was initial confusion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RUUD88oLHM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Interview with Sen.
