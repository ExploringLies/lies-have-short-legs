(Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But this notion that this is really bad or worse for Obama, it&rsquo;s actually right in the average, and if anything impressive because we&rsquo;re in such a super polarized time period.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He spoke over a bar chart showing approval ratings of the presidents he mentioned &quot;about 1,750 days&quot; into their second term. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gG1Ew7pttJ1CdCOWc-9OX5ITv5trfMyzoLBnfhLYLc86qCyUEr5BNp6l709akD-rayaIKJrROj7z2s-K0pRz8sDLLUkra7JTKclghmxqi6C5clHeuWfHFGJ5-Q\" style=\"height:370px; width:596px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intrigued by his point, we looked into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview with PunditFact, Melber told us he used data from Gallup&rsquo;s<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx?ref=interactive\"><u>Presidential Job Approval Center,</u></a> an interactive tool that allows users to compare Gallup approval ratings of each president since President Harry Truman (1945-53) at various points in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melber isolated Johnson, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. For all but Johnson, the 1,750th or so day falls around the first full week of November. (Johnson&rsquo;s 1,750th day does not fall around the same time because he finished out Kennedy&rsquo;s term before being re-elected, so his comparable rating is from September 1968, just months before he left office.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama&rsquo;s 1,750th day fell during the week of Nov. 4-10, when his job approval rating was at 41 percent. For the comparable week, Johnson&rsquo;s was 42 percent, Bush&rsquo;s was 40 percent, and Clinton&rsquo;s was 59 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melber said he chose to compare those presidents because Bush is recent and the others are Democratic two-termers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We created the graphic of four presidents&#39; ratings in order to reference those four presidents -- not all presidents,&quot; Melber said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even by this narrow comparison, it&rsquo;s not accurate to say Obama&rsquo;s poll numbers are &quot;right in the average.&quot; But we&rsquo;re not sure viewers would think Melber was comparing Obama with just three other presidents -- particularly when he said &quot;over the entire history of second-term presidents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you expand the pool, how does Melber&rsquo;s claim stand up?

Truman.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Approval rating for presidents in their 1,750th day in office</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"height:200px; width:600px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>President</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Percent</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Obama</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>41 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>George W.

He looked at the monthly average of polls for presidents in the first November of their second term. He argued this way smooths out weekly blips, and offers a more accurate portrayal of Truman and Johnson, who shared first terms with predecessors who died in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing by the number of days served puts Johnson well into his second term in September 1968, when his approval rating began to sour over the Vietnam War, Newport said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That exaggerates the disparity. Using Newport&rsquo;s methodology, second-term presidents had an average approval rating of about 51 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Melber is correct about one thing: This is one of the most polarized eras in American history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sometimes it seems to me that the American people are living in different countries, or different universes,&quot; she said. &quot;Republicans and Democrats have completely different impressions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bowman also would have gone about the comparison in a different way, starting by including Reagan over Johnson, and by looking at different polls, too. (A <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57613067/poll-obamacare-support-obama-approval-sink-to-new-lows/\"><u>CBS News poll</u></a> released Wednesday, after Melber&rsquo;s segment, put his approval rating at 37 percent. Gallup&rsquo;s three-day rolling average for Nov. 17-19 was down to <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/113980/gallup-daily-obama-job-approval.aspx\"><u>40 percent</u></a>.) She said the political climate was so different in Truman and Eisenhower&rsquo;s time that she, like Melber, would have left them out. She empathized with Melber trying to make a point in a tight crunch on television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People pick and choose polling data they want to highlight,&quot; Bowman said. &quot;I think he should have been more precise in his wording, but I&rsquo;m not gonna give him darts and arrows for this kind of thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melber said:&nbsp;&quot;As to the approval numbers, it&rsquo;s very important to understand, we look at Gallup over the entire history of second-term presidents, and you&rsquo;ve got in the 40s this president. At the same point, 1,700 days or so in, that&rsquo;s exactly about where (George) W. Bush was, it&rsquo;s where LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) was. (Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer.&quot; Depending on what presidents you pick, and how you gauge the time frame, Melber comes close. Obama&rsquo;s approval ratings are roughly in the range of some presidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But looking at the numbers other ways produce vastly different results. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melber&rsquo;s claim is partially accurate but take things out of context.
