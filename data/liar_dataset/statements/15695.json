teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An earlier version of the GOP attack, which we fact checked in 2017, <a

Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/08/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-mostly-misfires-attack-governor-cand/\">As we reported</a> in the earlier fact check, Harris was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the state GOP continued to hammer on the case in 2017, it was <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/daniel-bice/2017/11/02/bice-gop-rips-tony-evers-not-ousting-porn-viewing-teacher-accused-sexually-crude-remarks/824842001/\">later reported</a> that a fellow staff member had told the school district&rsquo;s investigators Harris also had made crude remarks to staffers about the appearances and chest sizes of female students. However, Evers&rsquo; department said neither the department nor the arbitrator could determine whether Harris actually made the sexually crude comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. The arbitrator concluded that Harris&rsquo; behavior did not endanger any students &nbsp;&mdash; a key finding, based on state law at the time &mdash; and the decision to give Harris back his job was upheld by two courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real punch in the Republican Party&rsquo;s attack, though, is aimed at Evers. So, where does he come in?</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/politifact.wisconsin/\">Like us on Facebook</a>.

The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator, who ruled the teacher had been fired improperly and gave the teacher back his job.
