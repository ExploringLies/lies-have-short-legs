It&rsquo;s based on lies by the environmental community. And yes -- they went there -- it&rsquo;s a tax on sacks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a public hearing, Mark Daniels, a vice president from Hilex Poly Co., said the proposal would force consumers to &quot;pay a tax on paper bags.&quot; To that, bag-ban champion <a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/legislators/Mark-Hass/\">Sen. Mark Hass</a>, D-Beaverton, jumped in and said the nickel charge is not a tax, and pointed to a Legislative Counsel opinion showing so. The next day, the Taxpayer Association of Oregon, which is opposed to the bag ban, <a href=\"http://oregoncatalyst.com/7219-senator-hass-tries-to-censor-the-word-tax-from-bag-tax-bill.html#more-7219\">accused Hass of trying </a>to censor speech.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we wanted to know, is a nickel charge on a paper bag a tax? Is it a de-facto tax?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA tax has a very specific definition in Oregon government. It&rsquo;s so specific that the state constitution calls for a higher number of votes-- three-fifths of each chamber -- to pass a tax than to pass a fee, which only requires a simple majority. Voters approved the change in May 1996, embedding the provision into the Oregon Constitution. In any case, to be a tax, it must raise revenue for the general treasury.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFormer legislative counsel Greg Chaimov agrees with the current Legislative Counsel opinion that the nickel provision is neither a tax nor a fee. &quot;It&rsquo;s whatever the grocers want to call it. For constitutional purposes, a fee or a tax is at issue only if it is bringing money into the government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDexter Johnson, the current legislative counsel, said the bag charge would be most similar to the bottle bill deposit, also known as the &quot;container deposit law.&quot; In Oregon and in other states, you have to pay a nickel extra for beer, soft drinks and bottled water; that money stays with distributors unless you return the bottle to the grocer for your nickel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd here&rsquo;s another charge that doesn&rsquo;t count as a tax or a fee. In 1999, state lawmakers ordered utility companies to assess a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/PUC/consumer/Public_Purpose_Charge.pdf?ga=t\">public purpose charge</a>&quot; on electricity and gas bills. Much of the money goes to the nonprofit Energy Trust of Oregon, with some proceeds going to weatherize schools and low-income homes. Again, it doesn&rsquo;t &quot;raise revenue&quot; because the money doesn&rsquo;t go into state coffers -- even if the government dictates how the money should be spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to the bag charge. The state doesn&rsquo;t get any of that money. Grocers can spend the money however they want. And shoppers -- and this is critical -- don&rsquo;t need to pay a nickel for a paper bag. They are free to bring in their own carrying devices, from gym bags to multi-use plastic bags to previously used paper bags. There is no constitutional right to a disposable sack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnna Richter Taylor, a lobbyist representing Hilex, argues that for Oregonians who have never before had to pay for a supermarket bag, this is a tax. &quot;The Legislature can call it what they want, but government -- and not grocers -- is forcing consumers to buy a reusable bag or a paper bag,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon doesn&rsquo;t like paying for something that once was free. But remember, television used to be free. Bottled drinks were once 5 cents cheaper. Utility companies used to not charge 3 percent extra for energy programs. Frankly, we think it&rsquo;s easier to avoid the 5 cent charge on bags than it is to bypass bottled drinks or the public purpose charge on utility bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/02/politifact_oregon_is_a_paper_b.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-11T12:06:46.345702", "ruling_date": "2011-02-13T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mark Daniels says Oregon\u2019s proposed paper bag fee is a tax", "ruling_headline_slug": "mark-daniels-says-oregons-proposed-paper-bag-fee-t", "ruling_link_text": "Shoppers can avoid the charge", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>The</em><em> Oregonian, </em><a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/02/plastic_bag_ban_debate_green_m.html\">&quot;Plastic bag ban debate: Green milestone for Oregon or a new tax on groceries?&quot;</a> Feb. 8, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>The Oregonian</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2011/02/the_proposed_oregon_plastic_ba.html\">The proposed Oregon plastic bag ban: tax or not?</a>&quot; Feb. 9, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLetter from Legislative Counsel Dexter A.
