Really familiar. As it turns out, the web version of Kristof&rsquo;s column sourced a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/18/mark-shields/pbs-commentator-mark-shields-says-more-killed-guns/\">PolitiFact article</a> from Jan. 18, 2013, that fact-checked commentator Mark Shields&rsquo; claim that since 1968, &quot;more Americans have died from gunfire than died in &hellip; all the wars of this country&#39;s history.&quot; (Shields used the year 1968 because it was the year presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated by gunman Sirhan Sirhan.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated the claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two and a half years later, we wondered whether the statistic still held up, so we took a new look at the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deaths from warfare</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf\"> published by the Congressional Research Service</a> on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for up-to-date deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website<a href=\"http://icasualties.org/\"> icasualties.org</a>. Where possible, we&rsquo;ve used the broadest definition of &quot;death&quot; &mdash; that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one change we&rsquo;ve made since our initial fact-check is to revise upward the number of Civil War deaths. As <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/mar/11/mailbag-what-are-you-kings-truth/\">several readers pointed out</a> after we published our earlier fact-check, the CRS report cited 525,000 Union and Confederate dead, but a subsequent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/civil-war-toll-up-by-20-percent-in-new-estimate.html\">study</a> revised that estimate upward to 750,000. The study&rsquo;s author acknowledged a great deal of uncertainty about the proper figure, and some experts <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/the-civil-war-death-toll-reconsidered/\">later questioned</a> whether it&rsquo;s wise to include so many deaths from disease &mdash; perhaps two-thirds of the 750,000 figure &mdash; since disease in an era of relatively primitive medicine was so widespread that it&rsquo;s unclear what share of fatal disease during that period was really a result of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we&rsquo;ll err on the side of the higher estimate and use the 750,000 figure this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of deaths by major conflict:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Deaths</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Revolutionary War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>4,435</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>War of 1812</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,260</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mexican War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>13,283</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Civil War (Union and Confederate, estimate)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>750,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Spanish-American War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,446</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>World War I</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>116,516</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>World War II</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>405,399</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Korean War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>36,574</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Vietnam War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>58,220</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Persian Gulf War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>383</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Afghanistan War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,363</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Iraq War</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>4,492</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Other wars (includes Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>362</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>TOTAL</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1,396,733</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gunfire deaths</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we did in our previous fact-check, we used a conservative estimate of data from a <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00023655.htm\">1994 paper published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to count gun-related deaths from 1968 to 1980.

That&rsquo;s 120,130 more gun deaths than war deaths -- about 9 percent more, or nearly four typical years worth of gun deaths. And that&rsquo;s using the most generous scholarly estimate of Civil War deaths, the biggest component of American war deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll offer some added thoughts for context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These figures refer to all gunfire-related deaths, not just homicides. In fact, homicides represent a minority of gun deaths, with suicides comprising the biggest share. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun-related deaths were from suicides, 33 percent were from homicides, and roughly 1 percent each were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a risk in using a statistic like this to decry mass homicides carried out with guns. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in our view, Kristof framed this comparison with care. He mentioned suicides not once but three times in his column, and he referred broadly to the &quot;unrelenting toll of gun violence,&quot; not specifically to the toll of gun homicides. Indeed, at one point, Kristof specifically referenced the impact that stricter gun laws can have on gun suicides, writing that in 1996, after a mass shooting in Australia, lawmakers tightened gun laws. &quot;The firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved,&quot; according to data published in the Journal of Public Health Policy, Kristof wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll note that Kristof&rsquo;s wording differed ever so slightly from the claim by Shields that we checked previously. While Shields said that &quot;more Americans have died from <em>gunfire</em>,&quot; Kristof wrote that &quot;more Americans have died from <em>guns</em>.&quot; Some may argue that guns don&rsquo;t kill people, people do. However, that&rsquo;s a philosophical judgment and beyond our ability to fact-check. Here, we&rsquo;ll stick to the numbers, and we find they&rsquo;re on Kristof&rsquo;s side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kristof wrote, &quot;More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even using a significantly higher estimate for Civil War deaths than we did the last time we fact-checked this claim, the comparison still holds up. The number of gun deaths since 1968 &mdash; including, as Kristof was careful to note, both homicides and suicides &mdash; was higher than war fatalities by roughly 120,000 deaths, or almost four years&rsquo; worth of gun deaths in the United States.
