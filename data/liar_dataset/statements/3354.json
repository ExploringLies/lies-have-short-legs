The average total compensation figure for teachers exceeded $100,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked MacIver spokesman Brian Farley if he had any additional evidence. He cited a February 2011 <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/115824814.html\">posting</a> from the School Zone blog on JSOnline.com, which reported slightly different numbers than those in MacIver&rsquo;s video.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe posting quoted MPS&rsquo; budget manager as saying that in 2011-2012 (the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2011), the average MPS teacher would receive total compensation of $101,091 -- $59,500 in salary and $41,591 in benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe double-checked with MPS spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin and she confirmed the figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to compare the $101,091 for MPS teachers to other teachers, but the <a href=\"http://dpi.state.wi.us/lbstat/newasr.html\">latest </a><a href=\"http://dpi.state.wi.us/lbstat/newasr.html\">figures</a> compiled by the state Department of Public Instruction are for 2009-2010, two years earlier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose figures show for 2009-2010, MPS teachers earned, on average, $56,095 in salary plus $30,202 in benefits, for a total of $86,297.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was lower than eight other school districts in Milwaukee County, including Greendale, Greenfield, Shorewood, Cudahy, Fox Point, South Milwaukee, Franklin and Nicolet, which was highest at just over $103,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s return to the MacIver Institute claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe conservative think tank said the average annual compensation for a Milwaukee Public Schools teacher would exceed $100,000 in 2011.
