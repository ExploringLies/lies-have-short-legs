We thought it merited a fresh look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports from left-leaning think tanks reaffirm Clinton&rsquo;s claim. A 2015 <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>study</u></a> from the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Economic Policy Institute</u></a> found that CEOs from 350 top firms make an average of $16.3 million a year, including stock options and other forms of compensation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>That averages out to about 303 times the pay of an &quot;average worker,&quot; which matches up with Clinton&rsquo;s ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other pro-worker sources support this claim. Labor giant AFL-CIO issues an annual <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/Corporate-Watch/Paywatch-2015\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Executive Paywatch</u></a>&quot; report, which highlights the disparity between low-income workers and well-compensated CEOs. Its 2014 report says the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 373 to 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Nevada, Reno economics professor Elliott Parker agreed with the studies and said in an email that the number cited by Clinton was &quot;in the ballpark.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that variances in the studies are due to the fact that different groups use different metrics and methods to crunch the numbers. PolitiFact Virginia previously <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2014/oct/19/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-ceos-make-350-times-more-workers/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>addressed this issue</u></a> and found that there&rsquo;s no standard formula for determining salary and compensation for both average workers and CEOs. This makes it hard to accurately compare the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right-leaning groups have poked holes in the numbers. American Enterprise Institute economist Mark Perry <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/publication/lots-of-problems-with-the-afl-cios-ceo-to-worker-pay-analysis-including-using-part-time-worker-pay/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>takes issue</u></a> with the methodology behind the AFL-CIO study and called it &quot;bogus/exaggerated/distorted&quot; in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He says the AFL-CIO analysis makes misleading comparisons and cherry-picks data in order to make the wage gap look as high as possible. Perry says limiting the data to the top 350 companies isn&rsquo;t representative for the majority of workers, and that CEOs at those highly-valued companies should be duly compensated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The value of Apple stock ($521 billion) is more than the value of the entire stock market in Brazil,&quot; he wrote in an email. &quot;If Tim Cook makes 300 times more than a plumber in Kansas, so what?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the difficulty is that there&rsquo;s no way to accurately gauge the average salary for workers at the companies headed by the 350 &quot;top CEOs.&quot; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>These variances in crunching the numbers may soon be resolved. Part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill requires public companies to disclose CEO and median worker compensation, and <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-160.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>takes effect in 2017</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s ad states that &quot;it takes 300 Americans working for a solid year to make as much money as one top CEO.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no standard metric used to measure income disparity, but Clinton&rsquo;s ad seems to land on the safe side of many recent studies. Clinton hedges by sticking to a smaller number, but there are still imperfections in the methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-12T11:07:07.662556", "ruling_date": "2016-02-12T12:01:22", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton ad says it takes a year for 300 working Americans to earn as much as a top CEO", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-ad-says-it-takes-300-working-ameri", "ruling_link_text": "Top CEOs make an awful lot", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Mark Perry, University of Michigan, Flint, Feb. 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Elliott Parker, University of Nevada Economics Professor, Feb. 3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AFL-CIO website, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/Corporate-Watch/Paywatch-2015\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Executive Paywatch: High-Paid CEOs and the Low-Wage Economy</u></a>,&quot; Accessed Feb. 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Top CEOs Make 300 Times More than Typical Workers</u></a>,&quot; Lawrence Mishel and Alyssa Davis, <em>Economic Policy Institute</em>, June 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.aei.org/publication/lots-of-problems-with-the-afl-cios-ceo-to-worker-pay-analysis-including-using-part-time-worker-pay/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Lots of problems with AFL-CIO&rsquo;s &lsquo;CEO-to-worker pay&rsquo; analysis including small sample size and using part-time worker pay</u></a>,&quot; Mark J.
