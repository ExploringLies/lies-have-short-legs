Our jobless rate is almost 12%, but Rubio still opposes extending unemployment benefits to the workers who need it most right now.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes the AFL-CIO detail Rubio&#39;s position correctly?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a little background: When workers lose full-time work through no fault of their own, they are usually eligible for unemployment benefits, small weekly payments intended to partially make up for lost wages. Employers pay taxes to fund the program, and states administer it based on federal guidelines. How much a person gets and how long benefits are paid varies by state. Usually, the benefits last about six months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn tough times, though, Congress often extends benefits, because of the difficulty of finding new jobs when unemployment is very high, as it has been since 2008, when the economy floundered.<b>&nbsp;</b>As a result, Congress has been arguing this summer about extending benefits again after extending them five times since Obama took office in 2009. Recent extensions have been structured so that workers in states where unemployment is higher receive additional weeks of benefits. In the states where unemployment is highest, some unemployed workers have been paid benefits for close to two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis summer, Republicans in the House and Senate balked at extending jobless benefits to about 3 million Americans without first finding a way to offset the $34 billion cost. Republicans proposed to pay for the extension with unspent funds from the 2009 economic stimulus package. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/jul/11/john-cornyn/mcconnell-proposed-extending-unemployment-benefits/\" id=\"x:rp\" title=\"Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky even offered a specific proposal\">Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky even offered a specific proposal</a> to extend benefits for two months while cutting the deficit $1.7 billion, he said. How? By adjusting Medicaid payments, trimming stimulus-funded food stamps in 2014, cutting $600 million in stimulus-supported programs to expand broadband Internet access and eliminating a provision letting qualified residents receive their earned-income tax credit throughout the year instead of&nbsp;at the end of the tax filing season.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDemocrats rejected McConnell&#39;s proposal, saying that the stimulus money would be needed elsewhere to boost job growth. They also accused Republicans of playing political games and noted correctly that emergency extensions typically never include cost offsets.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Senate passed the extension on July 21, without cost offsets, by a vote of 59-39. Maine Republicans Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins joined all but one Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, in supporting the extension without a way to pay for it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe House passed the benefits extension the next day 275-152. <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4213:@@@R\" id=\"nzhg\" title=\"Six Florida Republicans supported the extension in the House\">Six Florida Republicans supported the extension in the House</a> -- Gus Bilirakis, C.W.
