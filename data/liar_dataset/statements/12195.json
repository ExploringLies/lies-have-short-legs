They are praised as a way to prevent fraud and criticized as being a barrier for some citizens, including college <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/scott-walker-limited-early-voting-made-it-harder-c/\">students</a> and those who don&rsquo;t have a valid drivers <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2016/mar/21/kip-kendrick/rep-kip-kendrick-half-right-voter-id-statement/\">license</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said in June 2015 that most Americans support voter ID laws, we rated his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-most-americans-support-voter-id-/\">Mostly True</a>. Polls showed strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker signed Wisconsin&rsquo;s voter ID law in 2011, but the requirement was in place for only the spring 2012 primary election before being blocked by court challenges. Those eventually failed and the requirement was reinstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The April 2016 primary was the first <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/from-presidential-primary-to-local-races-stakes-are-high-b99699667z1-374539331.html\">high-turnout</a> election since the reinstatement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Similar claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A claim similar to Pocan&rsquo;s was made in August 2015, days after Texas&rsquo; voter ID law was ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas&quot; than find in-person voter fraud, U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/cory-booker/\">Cory Booker</a>, D-New Jersey, said in a national television interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National rated Booker&rsquo;s statement, which Booker said was about voter fraud by impersonation, as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/18/cory-booker/lightning-strikes-more-common-person-voter-fraud-s/\">True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The probability of being struck by lightning in Texas was 1 in 1.35 million. Based on the number of in-person voter fraud cases identified in Texas versus the number of ballots cast, those odds were lower -- 1 in 18 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan&rsquo;s claim is somewhat different -- it is about actual numbers, not odds, and is national in scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lightning strikes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Weather Service tracks lightning strikes. The <a href=\"http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml\">most recent figures</a> -- in terms of injuries as well as deaths caused by lightning strikes -- cover the 10-year period from 2004 through 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On average, the number of deaths and injuries reported each year was 267 -- 33 deaths, plus 234 injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weather service believes that total figure is higher, however, because some injuries from lightning strikes are not reported. It estimates that the total number of casualties per year is actually 330 -- 33 deaths plus 297 injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documented cases of voter fraud by impersonation are far fewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Voter fraud</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Election administration expert <a href=\"http://www.lls.edu/aboutus/facultyadministration/faculty/facultylistl-r/levittjustin/\">Justin Levitt</a>, who has been tracking allegations of voter fraud since 2000, most recently <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">wrote</a> on the topic in the Washington Post in August 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said in the piece that dating back to 2000 he found around the country 31 &quot;credible allegations of potential fraud that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls&quot; -- that is, possible fraud involving impersonation. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other election experts, including <a href=\"http://minnite.camden.rutgers.edu/\">Lorraine Minnite</a> of Rutgers University, also have used the lightning strike <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/04/24/the-myth-of-voter-fraud\">comparison</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say, however, that impersonation cases can be hard to count in that they are hard to prove -- particularly when no photo ID requirement is in place and a voter can cast a ballot simply by stating the name of a registered voter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the number of cases of in-person fraud by impersonation may be higher than that cited by Levitt, but no independent source suggests it is higher than the number of lightning strikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan said: &quot;More people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud&quot; by impersonation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roughly 300 people per year are struck by lightning in the United States.
