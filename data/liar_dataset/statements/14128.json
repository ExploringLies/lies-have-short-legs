The site has a banner reading &quot;Fox News: The FB Page,&quot; and several other posts resembling news stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This particular post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fake, part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to battle fabricated stories in news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story built on a real news story from NPR about the Big Easy replacing Confederate icons around the city.

It also added that the Davis monument would be &quot;melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the crude composite image plastered on the story, we saw a familiar sight: A real bronze statue of Obama <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-puerto-ricos-resident-commissi-20160903-photo.html\">installed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, back in 2012</a>. When last we saw this statue, it was erroneously cited as being erected in the White House (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/27/blog-posting/fake-news-theres-no-bronze-statue-president-barack/\">read here for more about&nbsp;that contrived tale</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TDAlliance.com appears to alter existing news stories, or make subtle changes to comments from officials in myriad posts.
