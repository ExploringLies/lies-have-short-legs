She repeated the claim hours later at a rally in Tempe, Ariz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has spoken out against marriage equality before, but we wondered if he still held that view. While he&rsquo;s said gays and lesbians deserve protection under the law, he has also said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would want to overturn the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;I am for traditional marriage&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first indication of Trump&rsquo;s feelings on same-sex marriage go back to an interview in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+%22gay+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-RWWTeCDEuLeiAKun8WdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ%20-%20v=onepage&amp;q=%22Donald%20Trump%22%20AND%20%22gay%20rights%22&amp;f=falselonghttp://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+%22gay+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-RWWTeCDEuLeiAKun8WdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Donald%20Trump%22%20AND%20%22gay%20rights%22&amp;f=false\">The Advocate in 2000</a>, when Trump was allegedly considering running for president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,&quot; Trump said. He added that he favored a domestic partnership law that would give same-sex couples the same legal benefits as married couples. (He voiced support for Elton John&rsquo;s 2005 civil union with David Furnish in a post on his <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060507020036/http://donaldtrump.trumpuniversity.com/default.asp?item=121537\">now-defunct Trump University blog</a>, however.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than a decade later, in a March 2011 interview as he mulled a presidential run, Trump <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2011/03/30/donald-trump-sits-down-bill-oreilly/\">told Fox News host Bill O&rsquo;Reilly</a> that he was against marriage equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I just don&#39;t feel good about it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I don&#39;t feel right about it. I&#39;m against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it&#39;s like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I&#39;m opposed to gay marriage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years later, Trump hedged a bit: &quot;I think I&rsquo;m evolving, and I think I&rsquo;m a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage. I am for traditional marriage, I am for a marriage between a man and a woman,&quot; he <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/thomas-roberts/thomas-roberts-donald-trump-interview\">told MSNBC in 2013</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Trump announced he <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-announces-2016-presidential-campaign-make-country/story?id=31799741\">really was running for president</a> on June 16, 2015, and he quickly reiterated he didn&rsquo;t support marriage equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html?_r=0\">U.S. Supreme Court ruling came out</a> on June 26, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/614434531861512193\">tweeted</a>, &quot;Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, Trump <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/06/28/donald-trump-on-cnns-state-of-the-union-im-in-it-to-win-it-i-will-make-our-country-great-again/\">told CNN&rsquo;s Jake Tapper</a> on CNN that he was &quot;just for traditional marriage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the next month that he thought pushing a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/07/05/donald-trump-punching-back/\">would not be a realistic approach</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by October 2015, he began to indicate that he would seek to overturn the Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have some very terrible Supreme Court justices, and frankly, they should have at least had that as a state&#39;s right issue,&quot; he <a href=\"http://www1.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2015/10/02/donald-trumps-faith-report-on-the-700-club\">told CBN News</a>. He also said he considered the ruling the law now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/31/ted-cruz-attacks-donald-trump-financial-record-trump-responds/\">Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace</a> on Jan. 31, 2016, that he disagreed with the court&rsquo;s 5-4 decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If I&#39;m elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things,&quot; Trump said. &quot;They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I don&#39;t like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state &mdash; it should be a states&#39; rights issue. And that&#39;s the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for a concise answer, Wallace asked Trump if he would &quot;try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I could strongly consider that, yes,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His position didn&rsquo;t change during the litany of GOP primary debates, although he hasn&rsquo;t strongly reiterated how he wanted to appoint judges who would reverse the decision. In March 2016, he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/03/04/in-debate-gop-candidates-rail-against-supreme-court-marriage-ruling/\">said at a Detroit debate</a> that he agreed with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz&rsquo;s opposition to the ruling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would certainly have rather left it to the states,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I was very surprised when they came up with that decision. I would preferred it had been left to the states, and I think most people would have preferred that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, Trump has said little about same-sex marriage. Trump&#39;s campaign didn&#39;t respond to our request for comment, and Clinton&#39;s spokesman didn&#39;t add any further comment.&nbsp;His stump speeches tend to avoid same-sex marriage, and we couldn&rsquo;t find any instance of a traditional media outlet directly asking him about it since the debates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the GOP <a href=\"https://www.gop.com/platform/renewing-american-values/\">unveiled its party platform</a> during this summer&rsquo;s Republican National Convention, which urged the reversal of &quot;the Supreme Court&rsquo;s redefinition of marriage,&quot; Trump&rsquo;s influence was downplayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump &quot;has not really tried to weigh in on the platform,&quot; Wyoming Sen. John Barasso, the platform committee chairman, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/07/13/485899139/republican-platform-tilts-right-of-trump-on-lgbt-issues\">told NPR in July</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said Trump &quot;wants to undo marriage equality.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While he&rsquo;s waffled slightly at times, Trump has said repeatedly that he supported &quot;traditional marriage.&quot; He also has said he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices that would reverse the 2015 ruling allowing same-sex marriage. He has not said much on the subject in recent months, other than to reiterate he felt it should have been a state-level decision. But he has not recanted his earlier views, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90e8c49a-2cdf-46ae-be02-4f6c876eacad\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90e8c49a-2cdf-46ae-be02-4f6c876eacad</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-03T14:26:47.519424", "ruling_date": "2016-11-03T15:38:00", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump 'wants to undo marriage equality'", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-wants-undo-marri", "ruling_link_text": "Wants judges he thinks \"maybe could change things.\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EiZW41bVF9I\">Las Vegas campaign rally</a>, Nov. 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Advocate</em>, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+%22gay+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-RWWTeCDEuLeiAKun8WdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ%20-%20v=onepage&amp;q=%22Donald%20Trump%22%20AND%20%22gay%20rights%22&amp;f=falselonghttp://books.google.com/books?id=smMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+%22gay+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-RWWTeCDEuLeiAKun8WdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Donald%20Trump%22%20AND%20%22gay%20rights%22&amp;f=false\">Donald Trump interview</a>, February 2000 (via Google Books)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump University&rsquo;s The Trump blog, &quot;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060507020036/http://donaldtrump.trumpuniversity.com/default.asp?item=121537\">Elton John&#39;s Wedding</a>,&quot; Dec. 22, 2005 (via Wayback Machine)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2011/03/30/donald-trump-sits-down-bill-oreilly/\">Donald Trump Sits Down With Bill O&#39;Reilly</a>,&quot; March 30, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/thomas-roberts/thomas-roberts-donald-trump-interview\">Trump says he&rsquo;s &lsquo;evolving&rsquo; on gay marriage</a>,&quot; Nov. 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-announces-2016-presidential-campaign-make-country/story?id=31799741\">Donald Trump Announces 2016 Presidential Campaign: &#39;We Are Going Make our Country Great Again&#39;</a>,&quot; June 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html?_r=0\">Supreme Court Ruling Makes Same-Sex Marriage a Right Nationwide</a>,&quot; June 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/614434531861512193\">Twitter comment</a>, June 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/06/28/donald-trump-on-cnns-state-of-the-union-im-in-it-to-win-it-i-will-make-our-country-great-again/\">Donald Trump on CNN&#39;s State of the Union: &lsquo;I&#39;m in it to win it...
