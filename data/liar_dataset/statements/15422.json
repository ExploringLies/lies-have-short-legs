In an early morning tweet, he offered what seemed to be proof, from none other than former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a tweet, Trump appeared to quote Clapper as saying, &quot;Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign.&quot; Trump followed that with, &nbsp;&quot;No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever people might think amounts to spying (and we wrote that there&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2KLeob3\">no agreed-upon definition</a>), Clapper didn&rsquo;t say what Trump claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clapper said the opposite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clapper was interviewed May 22 on ABC News&rsquo; <em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/2d03yjXRPtI\">The View</a></em>. Here&rsquo;s the exchange with co-host Joy Behar:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Behar: </strong>&quot;I ask you, was the FBI spying on Trump&#39;s campaign?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Clapper:</strong> &quot;No, they were not. They were spying on &mdash; a term I don&#39;t particularly like &mdash; &nbsp;but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage and influence which is what they do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Behar:</strong> &quot;Well, why doesn&#39;t he like that? He should be happy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Clapper: </strong>&quot;He should be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House press office confirmed that Trump was referring to Clapper&rsquo;s ABC interview. But that wasn&rsquo;t the only time Clapper addressed the question of spying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clapper repeated his point the same day in an interview on CNN&rsquo;s <em>Anderson Cooper 360</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The objective here was actually to protect the campaign by determining whether the Russians were infiltrating it and attempting to exert influence,&quot; Clapper said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Trump&#39;s tweet, Clapper said May 23 on CNN it was &quot;a distortion of what I said.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3416775-DIOG-Redactions-Marked-Redacted.html\">FBI&rsquo;s guidelines</a> say direct investigation of a campaign should only come after a high-level review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is not invariably illegal to spy on a campaign or people in it,&quot; said Robert Litt, former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence. &quot;The question is, why are you doing it? Are you doing it for legitimate investigative purposes &ndash; for example if you have information that people in the campaign are engaged in criminal activity &ndash; or is your purpose to glean information that you would provide to the candidate&rsquo;s opponents for political use?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that Clapper had affirmed that the FBI had spied on the Trump campaign. That does not reflect Clapper&rsquo;s words. In two separate interviews Clapper said that the FBI was looking for Russian interference in the election with the aim of protecting the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He specifically said that the FBI had not spied on the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump turned Clapper&rsquo;s statements upside down and for that, we rate this claim False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-23T16:17:52.922173", "ruling_date": "2018-05-23T17:25:22", "ruling_headline": "Did ex-intelligence chief Clapper say FBI spied on Trump campaign?
