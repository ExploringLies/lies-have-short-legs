Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, highlighted the substantial role the United States plays in funding the U.N. during the confirmation hearing for U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When all of our taxpayers are paying roughly 22 percent of the budget, I think they do expect to see a more efficient and an organization that&#39;s more objective and more in keeping with our values,&quot; Portman said on <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?421753-1/un-ambassador-nominee-governor-nikki-haley-testifies-confirmation-hearing&amp;start=10332\">Jan. 18, 2017</a>. &quot;How do you intend to support U.S. national security interests, but also ensure that the U.N. is a more effective body toward promoting a more peaceful and less volatile world?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.N. and U.S. budget documents show Portman&rsquo;s number is correct, and if peacekeeping is included, the percentage gets even higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current U.N. regular budget calls for <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/gaab4185.doc.htm\">$5.4 billion</a> over two years. By a formula based on the size of a country&rsquo;s economy and other factors, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/245\">America&rsquo;s assessment</a> is set at 22 percent, or about $1.2 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/252179.pdf\">last Obama administration budget</a>, the United States provided $1.2 billion to the U.N. over two years, and Portman is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s just for the U.N.&rsquo;s regular budget. There are over a dozen other U.N. agencies and operations that American dollars also support. The single largest is peacekeeping with a price tag of about <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/C.5/70/24\">$7.8 billion</a> this year alone. The U.S. share of that cost is over 28 percent, or $2.2 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next three U.N. agencies -- all roughly in the $100 million per year range -- are the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, the United States provides about $3.3 billion a year to finance U.N. activities. A 40 percent cut would save taxpayers about $1.3 billion out of the current <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/nov/09/john-kerry/yep-most-people-clueless-us-foreign-aid-spending/\">$4.1 trillion U.S. federal budget</a>. The impact on the U.N. would be substantial, although the precise effect would depend on how the cuts are spread around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman said American taxpayers cover 22 percent of the U.N. budget. Budget documents from the U.N. and the United States confirm that. The percentage for peacekeeping operations is even higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63427eda-6b4a-44ef-8a7b-173dcc05f504\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63427eda-6b4a-44ef-8a7b-173dcc05f504</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-01T14:39:05.577637", "ruling_date": "2017-02-01T16:12:08", "ruling_headline": "How much does the United States contribute to the UN?", "ruling_headline_slug": "us-contribution-un-22-percent", "ruling_link_text": "Even more for peacekeeping", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?421753-1/un-ambassador-nominee-governor-nikki-haley-testifies-confirmation-hearing&amp;start=10332\">U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Confirmation Hearing</a>, Jan. 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/gaab4185.doc.htm\">Fifth Committee Recommends $5.4 Billion Budget for 2016-2017 Biennium</a>, Dec. 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/245\">Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations</a>, Dec. 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations, <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/N15/460/37/PDF/N1546037.pdf?OpenElement\">Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2016-2017</a>, Dec. 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. State Department, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/252179.pdf\">FY 2017 State Department budget request</a>, accessed Feb. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/financing.shtml\">Financing peacekeeping</a>, accessed Jan. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/contributors/2016/dec16_1.pdf\">Contributors to U.N. peacekeeping operations</a>, Dec. 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/world/americas/trump-un-funding-order.html?_r=0\">Trump Administration Holds Off on Issuing U.N.
