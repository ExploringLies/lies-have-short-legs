Facebook flagged the post as part of its initiative to eliminate fake news from its news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story cited ChristianTimesNewspaper.com as reporting Clinton filed a divorce petition in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know the story isn&rsquo;t real, because this exact same hoax has circulated online before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, which was a website that trafficked in fake news, tried to sell people the exact same story on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161115022102/http://christiantimesnewspaper.com/clinton-divorce/\">Nov. 10, 2016</a>, after Clinton lost the election to President Donald Trump. The website, which <a href=\"http://christiantimesnewspaper.com/?reqp=1&amp;reqr=\">now appears to be offline</a>, did not carry a disclaimer identifying its news as fabricated. It did say it &quot;does not take responsibility for any of our readers&#39; actions that may result from reading our stories.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some minor details of the ChristianTimesNewspaper.com story have been changed, but USANewsToday.org &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.freshdailyreport.com/breaking-hilary-clinton-filed-divorces-new-york-court/\">and several</a> <a href=\"http://worldpoliticsnow.com/2017/02/breaking-hilary-clinton-filed-for-divorce-in-new-york-courts/\">other fake</a> <a href=\"http://usadosenews.com/index.php/2017/02/13/breaking-hilary-clinton-filed-for-divorce-in-new-york-courts/\">news websites</a>, <a href=\"https://newsbreakshere.com/breaking-news-hillary-clinton-filed-divorce-new-york-courts\">as well</a> &mdash; reproduced essentially the same story in February. USANewsToday.org is a clickbait site <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/usanewstoday.org\">registered to an address in Macedonia</a>, where fake news is a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.mczy0xBe9#.lkKNZrJ7D\">lucrative cottage industry</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mirrors a minor trend we&rsquo;ve seen with fake news, in which a fabricated story that originally was posted weeks or months ago is suddenly resurrected and regains popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the original version of this story came after Clinton&rsquo;s presidential campaign loss, we can only make an educated guess as to the reason why this claim made a comeback. Valentine&rsquo;s Day, maybe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is no more accurate now than when it was first posted months ago.
