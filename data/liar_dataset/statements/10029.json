Nathan Deal signed the 2015 state budget that day, and that action gave them hope that school systems might be able to ease up on the worst of the belt-tightening measures. Unpaid furlough days. Larger class sizes. Shorter school years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State austerity cuts to public education started in 2003 --- well before the Great Recession -- and they are not ending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this year, they total $746.6 million, and that to educators, who can do the math, looked better than the $1 billion-plus-a-year cuts in each of the five prior years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have been through tough times since the Great Recession started,&quot; Deal said during a candidate forum that was part of the annual meeting of the Professional Association of Georgia Educators&rsquo; foundation on September 15th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just how tough?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor told the crowd that it has taken until this year for overall state revenues to return to the levels they were in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the country&rsquo;s longest recession since World War II lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, although surveys show many people believe it has lasted much longer.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all the debate about state budget cuts through the years -- especially in education &nbsp;-- we decided to run Deal&rsquo;s statement through the Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Deal campaign as we always do for supporting evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign spokeswoman Jen Talaber said Deal was relying on information from the Governor&rsquo;s Office of Planning and Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPB reports shows that 2007 was a fiscal high water mark for the state. Taxes on everything from personal and corporate income to gasoline and alcohol hit $17.8 billion that year, up $1.3 billion from 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those same documents show that as the national and Georgia economies sank, so did state revenues. At the low point --- which was the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 -- total tax collection were about $14.5 billion -- or $3.3 billion off the peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Fiscal 2014, which ended June 30 of this year, that total state tax collections were back to -- and slightly above -- 2007 levels, budget documents show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax collections for 2014 were $17.9 billion -- or about $100 million over 2007 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor is right on the money on this one. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Deal&rsquo;s statement as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-07T14:27:31.940075", "ruling_date": "2014-10-08T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Deal correct: Revenue recovery was long", "ruling_headline_slug": "deal-correct-revenue-recovery-was-long-time-coming", "ruling_link_text": "Tax revenue was up, then down", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Jen Talaber, Deal spokeswoman</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PAGE Foundation&rsquo;s annual Board of Trustees <a href=\".http://page.affiniscape.com/associations/9445/pagetv/?page=959&amp;tab=3&amp;ta\">meeting</a> at the Georgian Terrace Hotel in Midtown Atlanta, with candidate forum as its highlight</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review of records of the Governor&rsquo;s Office of Planning and Budget</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Cycle Dating Committee, <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/cycles/sept2010.html\">National</a> Bureau of Economic Research</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Recession Has (Officially) Ended,&quot; The <a href=\"http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/the-recession-has-officially-ended/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">New</a> York Times,&quot; by Catherine Rampell, September 20th, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2012/recession/pdf/recession_bls_spotlight.pdf\">Recession </a>2007-2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Nathan", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "", "id": 441, "last_name": "Deal", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "nathan-deal", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NathanDeal.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/441/", "total_count": 52, "true_count": 13, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p><strong>The state&rsquo;s overall revenues only returned this year to 2007 levels.</strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "candidate forum", "statement_date": "2014-09-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
