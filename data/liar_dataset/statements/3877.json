Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe says the cuts forced six of 58 family planning centers to close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In the current budget, the budget under which we are operating, the governor stripped out seven and a half million dollars that went to family planning centers throughout the state of New Jersey,&quot; Weinberg said at a discussion she hosted with women&rsquo;s health care providers and other female Democratic legislators. &quot;At the beginning of this current budget year, we had 58 family planning centers, we now have 52. Six have closed and others have cut back their hours.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey decided to check this claim, as lawmakers continue battling over funding for family planning services in New Jersey and nationally.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn June 2010, the state Assembly and Senate passed a bill that would restore the $7.45 million in funding cut for family planning services. Gov. Chris Christie vetoed the bill, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2010/Bills/S2500/2139_R1.HTM\">S2139</a>, saying New Jersey residents have access to &quot;comprehensive reproductive health care services&quot; at other sites and the state can&rsquo;t afford to &quot;provide duplicative funding for family planning centers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince then, Donna Leusner, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services, said her agency has been notified that six sites have closed: Westampton and Brown Mills locations run by the Burlington County Health Department; Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey&rsquo;s Cherry Hill center; FamCare, Inc.&rsquo;s Millville facility; the Bayonne Women&rsquo;s Health and Family Planning Center; and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey&rsquo;s Dover site.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe state Senate passed another bill,&nbsp;<a href=\"javascript:void(0)/*559*/\">S2899</a>, on May 23 that would restore the funding, but the Assembly has not yet voted on the measure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe organizations that ran the six centers told PolitiFact New Jersey that state funding cuts forced the closures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRalph Shrom, a spokesman for Burlington County, said the Westampton clinic and a satellite location at Deborah Hospital in Brown Mills closed at the end of 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Camden County, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey Lynn Brown said her organization closed its family planning services center in Cherry Hill, a site that was operating one day a week, in fall 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Millville location run by FamCare, Inc. that also operated one day a week closed on Dec. 1, according to Kimberly McKown-Strait, the organization&rsquo;s executive director.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe women&rsquo;s health center in Bayonne officially closed on April 29, Bayonne spokesman Joe Ryan said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTriste Brooks, the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey, said the organization&rsquo;s Dover site closed at the end of 2010.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s review: Six family planning clinics closed during the past fiscal year and representatives from each blamed the loss of state funding for the closure. Christie signed a budget that eliminated $7.45 million in funding for family planning services that the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed. The governor also vetoed a measure that would have restored the funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Weinberg&rsquo;s statement that the governor&rsquo;s cuts forced six family planning centers to close True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, join the conversation at <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/politifact_new_jersey_do_chris.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-07T12:51:51.316550", "ruling_date": "2011-06-10T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Sen.
