But we thought we&rsquo;d check to see whether Clinton has solid evidence that professional risk analysts have made that argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is Clinton right about how analysts have rated Trump? Basically, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the Clinton campaign what she was referring to, they pointed us to the periodic rankings of global risk published by the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Economist Intelligence Unit -- an affiliate of <em>The Economist</em>, the London-based newsweekly -- is a <a href=\"http://www.eiu.com/home.aspx#about\">research and analysis</a> firm that supplies clients, including businesses, with information about opportunities and risks around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firm <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35828747\">made headlines in March 2016</a> when it listed the possibility of a Trump presidency as one of the biggest threats to &quot;companies&rsquo; capacity to operate at target profitability.&quot; The rankings are based on &quot;qualitative&quot; judgments of a how powerfully an event could affect the world and how likely it is to happen, the firm says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its March ratings, the firm rated the risks from a Trump presidency as 12 on a 25-point scale. That ranked Trump sixth among the 10-item list of biggest threats, tied with &quot;the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Trump threat level increased in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfs.eiu.com/Article.aspx?articleType=gr&amp;articleId=2910\">July 2016 rankings</a>. A Trump presidency now ranks as the third-biggest global threat, with an increased score of 16 on the 25-point scale. In the meantime, the risk from jihadi terrorism has remained constant with a score of 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the July ratings, the only higher scores were 20 for &quot;China experiences a hard landing&quot; and, in a tie with Trump, a 16 for &quot;currency volatility and persistent commodity prices weakness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the firm wrote that &quot;although we do not expect Mr. Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil or a sudden economic downturn.&quot; The writeup cited his &quot;hostility&quot; to free trade, his hard line on Muslims, his &quot;militaristic tendencies,&quot; his skepticism toward NATO, and his &quot;indifference&quot; to nuclear proliferation in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firm had never rated a pending candidacy to be a geopolitical risk to the United States and the world, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/economist-trump-presidency-global-risk-220887\">an official told Politico</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/69W_dkuAO0Fum3Oo8iRJ3o2A4GafF9Zho0flrwL-76Zxaui84vCQ7M-f5HdwF9jX41Nc8mQ_URRhl_QcVP-wU-YwcLUBtLBOciNWkmtijrH4NUEoVFWIsAXxQiUiaCa6_hzzXeOU\" style=\"border:none; height:508px; width:610px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked with Robert Powell, the Economist Intelligence Unit&rsquo;s New York-based global risk briefing manager, to see whether he thought Clinton&rsquo;s phrasing was accurate, and he said it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Her quote does accurately describe our global risk scenarios,&quot; Powell told PolitiFact. &quot;Despite the high likelihood of more terrorist attacks, the impact on the global economy tends to be relatively slight -- indeed, most global stock markets rose on the day of the Brussels attacks, for instance. However, given that the U.S. economy is the biggest in the world, we believe a Trump presidency would have a major impact on the entire global economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said &quot;risk analysts&quot; -- plural -- had determined Trump to be a threat, but we were unable to find any equivalent of the Economist Intelligence Unit report. (Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said that &quot;analysts&quot; was intended to refer to the multiple analysts within the Economist Intelligence Unit who came up with the ratings.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we did find another major economic report that painted a grim picture of what could happen to the economy if Trump wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 17, Moody&rsquo;s Analytics, an economic research and data-services firm, <a href=\"https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/2016-06-17-Trumps-Economic-Policies.pdf\">published its projections</a> of what could happen to the economy under Trump-backed policies on taxes, government spending, immigration and international trade. (We fact-checked&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-trump-both-say-moodys-economist-others-tea/\">political background</a> of one of the Moody&#39;s authors in another report.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s economic proposals can be reached,&quot; the Moody&rsquo;s team wrote. &quot;One, they will result in a less global U.S. economy; two, they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; three, they will largely benefit very high-income households; and four, they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The analysts at one firm, the Economist Intelligence Unit, have declared the possibility of Trump&rsquo;s election to be the third-greatest global risk in its current rankings, a risk level that has only grown since the firm began including Trump in its rankings in March. And Clinton has accurately noted that the risk factor given to a Trump presidency is higher than the rating for Islamic terrorism on the firm&rsquo;s list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/99685807-e596-4fa7-ad2e-de8cc4063c57\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/99685807-e596-4fa7-ad2e-de8cc4063c57</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-27T15:17:26.150872", "ruling_date": "2016-06-27T16:08:27", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton correct that analysts have called Donald Trump a top global economic risk", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-correct-analysts-have-called-donal", "ruling_link_text": "So says the Economist Intelligence Unit", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4917877?3\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>speech in Cincinnati</u></a>, June 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economist Intelligence Unit, <a href=\"https://gfs.eiu.com/Article.aspx?articleType=gr&amp;articleId=2910\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>global risk ranking for Donald Trump</u></a>, July 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moody&#39;s Analytics, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/2016-06-17-Trumps-Economic-Policies.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Macroeconomic Consequences of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s Economic Policies</u></a>,&quot; June 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/economist-trump-presidency-global-risk-220887\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Economist rates Trump presidency among its top 10 global risks</u></a>,&quot; March 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35828747\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump presidency rated among top 10 global risks: EIU</u></a>,&quot; March 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Robert Powell, Economist Intelligence Unit global risk briefing manager, June 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Josh Schwerin, Clinton campaign spokesman, June 27, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech in Cincinnati", "statement_date": "2016-06-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "Analytics firm has said Trump is among top global threats"}
