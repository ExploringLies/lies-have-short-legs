Scott Walker</a> said Wisconsin is improving as a place for doing business, then boasted of a job-creation coup.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Employers feel good about our state,&quot; the Republican governor said, reflecting on the first half of his four-year term. &quot;During the past year, Kohl&rsquo;s Department Stores worked with us and announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a state with unemployment well <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/images/JOBS18G-2.jpg\">above 6 percent</a>, having 3,000 jobs set to come online would be huge news. But that&rsquo;s not the headline we remember.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, no ground has yet been broken on a second corporate headquarters for <a href=\"http://www.kohlscorporation.com/AboutKohls/AboutKohls01.htm\">Kohl&rsquo;s</a> that was announced in 2012, although planning is well under way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen it comes to employment, there are jobs and even promised jobs. Then there are potential jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSaying Kohl&rsquo;s &quot;announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs&quot; is different than saying Kohl expects or hopes to hire that many people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere does this one stand?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Growth of Kohl&rsquo;s</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first Kohl&rsquo;s department store opened in 1962 next to a Kohl&rsquo;s grocery store in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. Both the department store chain and the now-defunct grocery chain were started by <a href=\"http://www.hoovers.com/company/Kohls_Corporation/rryysi-1-1njhxk.html\">Max Kohl</a>, the father of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/herb-kohl/\">Herb Kohl</a>, who served for 24 years as a U.S. senator from Wisconsin before deciding not to seek re-election in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKohl&rsquo;s is now a chain of more than <a href=\"http://www.kohlscorporation.com/InvestorRelations/Investor01.htm\">1,100 </a>family-oriented department stores in 49 states, selling Jennifer Lopez, Princess Vera Wang and other lines of clothing, as well as a variety of home goods and other items. With $18.8 billion in sales in 2011, the publicly traded company -- which is no longer connected with the Kohl family -- <a href=\"http://www.stores.org/2012/Top-100-Retailers?order=field_usa_retail_sales_value&amp;sort=desc#.UPhn7fKH-So\">ranked 20th</a> on the National Retail Federation&rsquo;s 2012 list of the nation&rsquo;s top 100 retailers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn December 2011, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/kohls-could-be-nearing-headquarters-decision-rd3fk5m-135777443.html\">news</a> surfaced that Menomonee Falls-based Kohl&rsquo;s, which has 4,900 corporate employees in the Milwaukee area, might be close to announcing a decision on where to build a second headquarters building.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee was competing with Menomonee Falls, its suburban neighbor, for the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2012/07/19/mansell-kohls-could-spend-250m-add.html?page=all\">$250 million</a> corporate expansion. Three months later, Kohl&rsquo;s said it had decided against downtown Milwaukee and in July 2012, the company announced its chosen site in Menomonee Falls.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Walker&rsquo;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie for evidence to support Walker&#39;s claim, he provided us a news article and a news release from the governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike a number of other news <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/kohls-taps-falls-for-new-site-h366ak5-163121076.html\">articles</a> during the year, the four-paragraph November 2012 news <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/falls-kohls-complete-real-estate-deal-for-new-headquarters-i17flst-177034181.html?ipad=y\">item</a> in the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel </em>said the new headquarters was expected to create 3,000 jobs over 12 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Walker <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=275028\">news release</a> was issued on the day Kohl&#39;s announced the Menomonee Falls site. Walker said in the release that Kohl&#39;s would receive up to $62.5 million in state tax credits over 12 years, but the actual amount &quot;will be completely dependent upon the number of newly created jobs and the amount of Kohl&rsquo;s capital expenditure.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Economic Development Corp. <a href=\"http://inwisconsin.com/blog/2012/07/19/kohls/\">said</a> that under the deal, Kohl&rsquo;s must retain 4,500 jobs, create 3,000 jobs and invest $250 million in new and existing facilities to get the full amount of the tax credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, even news releases from Walker&rsquo;s office and one of his state agencies talk about the possibility of 3,000 jobs, not a certainty that they had been or would soon be created.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, in a <em>Milwaukee Business Journal</em> <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2012/07/19/mansell-kohls-could-spend-250m-add.html?page=all\">article</a> published the same day as Walker&rsquo;s news release, Kohl&rsquo;s chairman and chief executive officer <a href=\"http://www.kohlscorporation.com/pressroom/PressRoom02G.htm\">Kevin Mansell</a> said &quot;up to 3,000 jobs could be added&quot; over 12 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a projection that, even if well founded, doesn&rsquo;t amount to a commitment to create that many jobs. And there&rsquo;s no way to know whether economic conditions over 12 years will enable Kohl&rsquo;s to reach its hiring goal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker said that in 2012, Kohl&rsquo;s Department Stores &quot;announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat Kohl&rsquo;s announced is it would build a new headquarters and expected to create 3,000 jobs, over 12 years -- not that 3,000 jobs were a certainty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor being partially accurate but leaving out important details, we rate Walker&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-18T15:19:37.391796", "ruling_date": "2013-01-19T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Citing his accomplishments, Gov.
