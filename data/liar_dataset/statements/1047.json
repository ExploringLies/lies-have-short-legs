The government money came with strings, including restrictions on executive compensation. Plus, there was a stigma attached to participating in the government program.\n</p>\n<p>\n On June 9, the Treasury Department announced that 10 of the largest financial institutions that participated in the Capital Purchase Program (through TARP) have been approved to repay $68 billion. Yes, they had to be approved to repay the money. The companies had to prove they no longer needed the money, because the government doesn't want them begging for more down the road.\n</p>\n<p>\n To date, those 10 companies have paid dividends on their preferred stock to the Treasury totaling about $1.8 billion, the Treasury announced. Overall, dividend payments from all of the 600 bank participants has come to about $4.5 billion so far. That's commensurate with the 5 percent (annualized) dividend return that was part of the terms of the program.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, the government borrowed the money it invested in the banks, and so dividends from the preferred stock are offset by interest the government has had to pay on its loans. But that interest rate has been lower than the 5 percent dividend rate. So when the companies repay the loans, it will result in some profit to the government, banking analysts told us.\n</p>\n<p>\n There's another potential profit center. As part of the deal with banks, the federal government received warrants to buy stock at a future date (with the hope that as the economy improved and bank stock value rose, the government could share in the bounty). According to the Treasury announcement on June 9, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase those warrants at fair market value. Experts believe that could fetch the government several billion dollars. That's in addition to the dividends.\n</p>\n<p>\n David John, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while it's accurate to say the government is turning a profit on these specific transactions, it was so costly to create the TARP that &quot;you can't say the overall program is a moneymaker.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n And, John said, the 10 financial institutions that will be repaying the Treasury are among the strongest. It remains to be seen how the others will fare, he said.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;It's way too soon to judge the entire program,&quot; John said. &quot;I'd be surprised if it ends up anything better than break-even.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n Still, the public too often tagged TARP as a bailout, said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;It's as if people thought money was handed out to banks,&quot; Hall said. &quot;It wasn't. And it drove us nuts. The government has turned a profit. It made money plus some.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n Bank analyst Bert Ely said while the government may end up losing money on investments in some financial firms, it's likely the entirety of the bank portion of the TARP will ultimately turn a profit.\n</p>\n<p>\n The 5 percent paid in dividends on preferred stock purchased by the Treasury will certainly outpace the interest rate on money borrowed to finance the program, he said. And the warrants could also prove profitable.\n</p>\n<p>\n &quot;People think the government gave banks money,&quot; Ely said. &quot;They made investments in banks.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n As for Obama's claim, he is careful to note that the overall program could still cost taxpayers money, but he is correct to say the government turned a profit on the first round of repayments. We rate his statement True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:42.845722", "ruling_date": "2009-06-10T16:05:58", "ruling_headline": "Obama says government has so far turned a profit on money used to stabilize banks", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-says-government-has-so-far-turned-profit-mon", "ruling_link_text": "Early returns have paid off", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n U.S. Treasury,\n <a href=\"http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg162.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Treasury Announces $68 Billion in Expected CPP Repayments\n </a>\n , June 9, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n FinancialStability.gov, weekly TARP Transation Reports\n</p>\n<p>\n CQ Transcriptwire via Washington Post,\n <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/09/AR2009060901617.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Transcript: President Obama delievers remarks on pay-as-you-go requirements\n </a>\n , June 9, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Associated Press,&nbsp;\n <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090609/ap_on_bi_ge/us_tarp_winners_and_losers\" target=\"_blank\">\n  &quot;10 big banks get OK to repay $68B in bailout money,&quot;\n </a>\n by Daniel Wagner, June 9, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with David John, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, June 9, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with bank analyst Bert Ely, June 9, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, June 9, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In the first round of repayments&quot;&nbsp; from financial institutions that received TARP money, &quot;the government has actually turned a profit.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a statement at the White House", "statement_date": "2009-06-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
