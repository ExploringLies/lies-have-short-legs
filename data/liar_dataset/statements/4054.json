The two Williamses (unrelated) are both Republicans who recently dropped U.S. Senate bids to run in the same newly created North Texas House district.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My opponent does not live in the district,&quot; Roger Williams said June 28, <a href=\"http://weatherforddemocrat.com/local/x1295079249/In-the-running\">according to</a> The Weatherford Democrat. &quot;My opponent has never voted in the district.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot living there? Never voted there?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei\">Per</a> the U.S. Constitution, a citizen does not have to live in a congressional district to hold its House seat, though they must be an inhabitant of the same state. If a candidate doesn&#39;t live in the district, though, their opponents are likely to point that out.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this episode, Roger Williams was questioning his foe&#39;s ties to the 33rd Congressional District just drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Its map of the state&rsquo;s 36 congressional districts awaits Gov. Rick Perry&rsquo;s approval.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMichael Williams&rsquo; campaign disputed Roger Williams&rsquo; charge in a June 30 press release. The release says Michael Williams and his wife, Donna, &quot;have owned and claimed a homestead exemption on the same home&quot; in the district since 1995 and, it says, Williams has voted in Arlington many times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview, Will Fullerton, Michael Williams&rsquo; campaign manager, told us Williams lived in an Austin condominium while serving on the Texas Railroad Commission, from 1999 to this spring, to satisfy a state constitutional <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.4.htm#4.23\">provision </a>requiring statewide elected officials to live in the capital. He said too that Williams has lived in his Arlington home since resigning from the commission as of April 2.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWilliams was registered to vote in Austin while serving as a commissioner, Fullerton said, though he laid plans to register in Tarrant County after stepping down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned next to government sources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a clerk with the Tarrant County Appraisal District, Michael and Donna Williams have claimed a homestead exemption on an Arlington residence since 1995. A county elections clerk, Rita Castillo, told us the county fielded a voter registration application from Michael Williams on June 24 and it&rsquo;s being reviewed by the Texas secretary of state&rsquo;s office, which oversees elections. Castillo said a state database lists Michael Williams as currently registered to vote in Austin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResponding to our open-records&rsquo; request, Tarrant County later provided information indicating that Michael Williams went to the county&rsquo;s polls 10 times from November 1994 through November 1999.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo our inquiry, Roger Williams&rsquo; spokesman Colby Hale stressed by email that Michael Williams admits to living in Austin for a decade and to making Austin the &quot;principal location where he votes.&quot; He later added that Roger Williams intended to say that for more than a decade, Michael Williams lived, worked and voted in Austin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFar as we can tell, this amended description is about right. However, Michael Williams has also lived in Arlington, where he has claimed a homestead in Arlington for more than 15 years. And contrary to his foe&rsquo;s published statement, Michael Williams also has voted in the 33rd district and lives there now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll told, the essence of Roger Williams&rsquo; statement &mdash; that Michael Williams is a carpetbagger &mdash; doesn&rsquo;t hold up. We rate the claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-03T15:26:58.837855", "ruling_date": "2011-07-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Roger Williams says foe has never voted in congressional district and doesn't live there", "ruling_headline_slug": "roger-williams-says-foe-has-never-voted-congressio", "ruling_link_text": "Homestead since '95, voted then too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPress release, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/06302011_michaelwilliamspressrelease.html\">&quot;Response to Recent Claims by Roger Williams,&quot;</a> , Michael Williams U.S. House campaign, June 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTarrant County Elections Center, response to open-records&rsquo; request (excerpted), <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/06302011_tarrantcountresponsepftexas.txt\">&quot;Michael Williams Voting History&quot;</a> (received June 30, 2011)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Rita Castillo, Tarrant County Elections Center, elections clerk, June 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Will Fullerton, campaign manager, Michael Williams campaign, June 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Melissa Salazar, exemptions clerk, Travis County Appraisal District, Fort Worth, June 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Weatherford Democrat, news article, <a href=\"http://weatherforddemocrat.com/local/x1295079249/In-the-running\">&quot;In the running, Williams kicks of campaign with Weatherford visit,&quot;</a> Sept. 29, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Businessman", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Roger", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1282, "last_name": "Williams", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "roger-williams", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/williams.jpeg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1282/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.rogerforcongress.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays U.S. House opponent Michael Williams does not live in and has never voted in the congressional district he&rsquo;s seeking to represent.</p>", "statement_context": "at a campaign stop.", "statement_date": "2011-06-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Lawyer", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1220, "last_name": "Williams", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-williams", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mwilliams2011.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1220/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.williamsfortexas.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
