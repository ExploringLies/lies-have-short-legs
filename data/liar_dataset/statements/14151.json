Families get tax credits to make insurance cheaper, and people with pre-existing conditions are protected. Thank Congressman Carlos Curbelo for fighting for the better health care we deserve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While AHCA has some language that is intended to protect those with pre-existing conditions, health care experts have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/\">previously</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/\">told us</a> that the legislation would allow insurance companies to charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted the American Action Network&rsquo;s spokeswoman but did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>GOP bill would allow insurers to charge more for pre-existing conditions</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-aca/pre-existing-conditions/index.html\">Affordable Care Act</a> adopted in 2010 prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage &mdash; or charging higher premiums &mdash; because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Health Care Act, as passed by the House, does not approach pre-existing conditions the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The literal language of an <a href=\"http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170424/MacArthur%20Amendment.pdf\">amendment</a> appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions. It states that &quot;nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the issue: That language says insurers have to provide access for those with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It says nothing about the <em>costs</em> for those patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislation permits insurers to set premiums based on the &quot;health status&quot; of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and making a guess as to how they will use medical care in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means the costs would rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,&quot; Jost said. &quot;Under the<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/\"> MacArthur amendment</a>, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exact amount might differ regionally, as some states might not allow the higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislation would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the &quot;essential health benefits.&quot; The waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/06/gop-revives-obamacare-repeal-bill-risk-pools/100115530/\">federal invisible risk-sharing program</a> to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/wisconsin-voter/2017/05/08/health-care-fight-backfire-gop/101370250/\">Republicans argue</a> that the high-risk pools will protect those consumers with pre-existing conditions. &nbsp;(Curbelo&rsquo;s spokeswoman sent us a copy of the <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/AHCA_PreExisting_Conditions.pdf\">Republican talking points </a>that make that argument.) To sweeten the legislation for Republicans on the fence before the vote, the GOP added in more money for those risk pools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status. However, many low-income people aren&rsquo;t able to stay covered without breaks, and questions remain about the effectiveness of the <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/\">high-risk pools</a>. Many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/\">unaffordable</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>An ad by the American Action Network says that under the American Health Care Act &quot;people with pre-existing conditions are protected.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only kernel of truth here is that the amendment has language that states insurers can&rsquo;t limit access to coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. However, the ad omits that the House GOP health plan would weaken protections for these patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislation would allow states to give insurers the power to charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition. While Republicans point to the fact that those patients could get help through high-risk pools, experts question their effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current law does not allow states to charge people with pre-existing conditions significantly more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n'<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-24T12:40:46.043204", "ruling_date": "2017-05-24T15:44:14", "ruling_headline": "Conservative group's ad misleads about pre-existing conditions in GOP health care bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservative-groups-ad-misleads-about-pre-existing", "ruling_link_text": "Read the entire legislation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>American Action Network, <a href=\"http://americanactionnetwork.org/press/american-action-network-kicks-off-2-million-nationwide-tv-ad-campaign-ahca/\">American Action Network Kicks Off $2 Million Nationwide TV Ad Campaign on AHCA</a>, May 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Health and Human Services, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-aca/pre-existing-conditions/index.html\">&quot;Pre-Existing Conditions,&quot; </a>Accessed May 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Rep.
