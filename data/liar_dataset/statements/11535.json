William Westmoreland in 1969 when Carson was a&nbsp;ROTC student leader in Detroit &mdash; in his books and comments throughout the years. But Carson never applied to West Point nor does Westmoreland&rsquo;s schedule place him in Detroit at the time Carson said he was, according to <em>Politico</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a &quot;full scholarship&quot; to West Point, as everyone accepted to the five federal service academies receives free tuition in exchange for their service. When asked about discrepancy on ABC&rsquo;s <em>This Week</em> by host George Stephanopoulos, Carson said the academy itself uses the terminology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wait a minute George, go look on the West Point website, and you&rsquo;ll see those specific words, &lsquo;full scholarship to West Point,&rsquo; &quot; Carson said&nbsp;Nov. 8. &quot;So even though it is, you know, given as a grant for anybody who gets in, those words are used. And if a recruiter or somebody who&rsquo;s trying to get you to come there or trying to get you to do that, those are the very words they will use. It&rsquo;s on their website.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if the words really are advertised on West Point&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could not reach the military academy. Searching for the &quot;specific words &lsquo;full scholarship to West Point&rsquo;&quot; turned up no results on West Point&rsquo;s own <a href=\"http://www.westpoint.edu/SitePages/Search.aspx?k=%22full%20scholarship%20to%20West%20Point%22\">website</a> or on <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/search?as_q=%22full+scholarship+to+West+Point%22&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;lr=&amp;cr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_sitesearch=www.westpoint.edu&amp;as_occt=any&amp;safe=images&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_rights=\">Google</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official admissions <a href=\"http://www.usma.edu/admissions/SitePages/Home.aspx\">page</a> also makes no mention of a scholarship of any kind. Instead, it simply notes that &nbsp;tuition, room and board, and expenses are fully paid for those who are selected to attend West Point.&nbsp;The academy&rsquo;s diversity page, however, <a href=\"http://www.usma.edu/admissions/SitePages/Diversity_Outreach.aspx\">states</a> that &quot;this four-year college experience is a fully funded scholarship.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson&rsquo;s spokesperson told us that&nbsp;West Point has referred to their benefits as a full scholarship in publications, a point Carson made in a Nov. 8 Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/realbencarson/posts/551602598339544\">post</a>. He uploaded two West Point recruitment ads targeted at African-Americans that contain the word &quot;scholarship,&quot; including <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Ql8CIGb9y5QC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Cadets+receive+a+four-year+scholarship,+which+includes+full+tuition,+room+and+$147.30+a+month+allowance.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIsfCSnLaByQIVS3E-Ch067ged#v=onepage&amp;q=Cadets%20receive%20a%20four-year%20scholarship%2C%20which%20includes%20full%20tuition%2C%20room%20and%20%24147.30%20a%20month%20allowance.&amp;f=false\">one</a> from the 1960s, when he was a student. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found examples of the words &quot;full scholarship&quot; used in publications that are linked on West Point&rsquo;s website, as well as some old recruiting advertisements:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; A <a href=\"http://www.usma.edu/oir/common%20data%20set/common%20data%20set%202012-2013.pdf\">dataset</a> from 2014: &quot;At the United States Military Academy all students receive a <strong>full scholarship,</strong> including room &amp; board and medical- and dental-care are provided by the U.S. Army.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; A <a href=\"http://www.westpoint.edu/admissions/shared%20documents/wp_prospectus.pdf\">prospectus</a> from 2012: &quot;As a cadet, you are a member of the U.S. Army and receive a <strong>full scholarship </strong>and an annual salary of more than $10,000 from which you pay for your uniforms, textbooks, a laptop computer, and incidents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; An <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=GF4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT109&amp;dq=%22the+opportunity+to+attend+West+Point+on+a+full+government+scholarship%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAGoVChMIq-Hl4YyByQIVyE0mCh3kTgx3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20opportunity%20to%20attend%20West%20Point%20on%20a%20full%20government%20scholarship%22&amp;f=false\">ad</a> in a 1991 issue of<em> Black Enterprise </em>magazine: &quot;Each year about 1,400 young men and women take advantage of the opportunity to attend West Point on a <strong>full government scholarship,</strong> which includes tuition, room and board and medical care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&bull; An ad that appeared in a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=7NMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22You+receive+a+full+scholarship,+earn+a+degree+from+one+of+the+country%E2%80%99s+finest+colleges,+and+build+a+foundation+for+a+challenging+career+of+service+to+the+nation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAGoVChMIpIDFk46ByQIVRjUmCh10LQe8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22You%20receive%20a%20full%20scholarship%2C%20earn%20a%20degree%20from%20one%20of%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20finest%20colleges%2C%20and%20build%20a%20foundation%20for%20a%20challenging%20career%20of%20service%20to%20the%20nation%22&amp;f=false\">few</a> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=p8wDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=%22You+receive+a+full+scholarship,+earn+a+degree+from+one+of+the+country%E2%80%99s+finest+colleges,+and+build+a+foundation+for+a+challenging+career+of+service+to+the+nation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAWoVChMIpIDFk46ByQIVRjUmCh10LQe8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22You%20receive%20a%20full%20scholarship%2C%20earn%20a%20degree%20from%20one%20of%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20finest%20colleges%2C%20and%20build%20a%20foundation%20for%20a%20challenging%20career%20of%20service%20to%20the%20nation%22&amp;f=false\">issues</a> of <em>Ebony </em>magazine in 1990: &quot;You receive a <strong>full scholarship</strong>, earn a degree from one of the country&rsquo;s finest colleges, and build a foundation for a challenging career of service to the nation.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The financial benefits to attending military academies have been essentially described as scholarship-like or equivalent to a scholarship by<em> <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/15/service-academies-congress-nomination-army-navy/15452669/\">USA Today</a></em>, a West Point spokesperson in <em><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/06/12/the-colleges-where-tuition-is-still-free/\">Forbes</a></em>, and the <a href=\"http://www.usna.edu/Student-Life/General-Information-for-Midshipmen.php\">Naval Academy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the term &quot;full scholarship&quot; is an inaccurate description, experts told us. The phrase typically refers to a college providing financial aid to allow a candidate to attend a college free of charge, but that doesn&rsquo;t really apply to West Point&rsquo;s across-the-board zero-tuition policy, said Antonio Buehler, a West Point alumnus who founded the admissions coaching service Abrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No such scholarship is named, every cadet is treated the same and there is an eight-year military commitment after graduation. Hence, not free,&quot; Buehler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proper terminology is &quot;appointment,&quot; said Vu Tran, a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy who runs the Denver-based admissions consulting firm Service Academy Coach. But because that&rsquo;s not apparent from the get-go, Tran says he can&rsquo;t fault Carson for using the term loosely, albeit incorrectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can definitely see where parents and students who are beginning the process can misconstrue it to be a scholarship,&quot; he said. &quot;But for those who have gone through the admission process and through the nomination process, they would never call it a scholarship.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson&rsquo;s use of the words &quot;full scholarship&quot; is even more inaccurate if he&rsquo;s describing his own experience, experts agreed. Tran told us it&rsquo;s conceivable a&nbsp;ROTC commander or even a general would encourage a student to apply to West Point, touting the free tuition, but noted that anyone familiar with the process understands that that&rsquo;s contingent upon nomination and acceptance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(Carson) would not have been &lsquo;offered&rsquo; the opportunity to attend West Point at no cost, like all other cadets, until he applied and received an appointment, which he never did,&quot; Buehler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson defended his use of the word scholarship in discussing his recruitment to West Point, saying, &quot;Go look on the West Point website and you&rsquo;ll see those specific words, &lsquo;full scholarship to West Point.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The military academy has used the words &quot;full scholarship&quot; a few times in admissions literature and advertisements and in one place on its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, experts say Carson&rsquo;s use of the word scholarship doesn&rsquo;t properly explain the application and appointment process to West Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson&rsquo;s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Correction: After this story was published, we found an additional instance of the words &quot;full scholarship&quot; on West Point&rsquo;s website.
