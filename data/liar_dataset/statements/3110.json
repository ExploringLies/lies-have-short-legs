After all, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made job creation the keystone of his administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Walker-requested measure in question is <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1AB-7.pdf\">Assembly Bill 7</a>, which would give tax credits to small businesses. What ticked off Mason, a four-year state lawmaker and former union organizer, were comments about the bill made during the committee meeting by freshman <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Assembly&amp;district=88\">Rep. John Klenke</a>, R-Green Bay, a retired businessman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKlenke, according to Mason, defended spending $80 million on the tax credits bill in an effort to improve how Wisconsin shows up in Google searches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with the $80 million part of Mason&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe measure is a Republican-sponsored bill with an <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/2011-13Bills/2011_01_18_JFC_SSAB7_SSSB7.pdf\">estimated </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/2011-13Bills/2011_01_18_JFC_SSAB7_SSSB7.pdf\">impact</a> of $79.2 million over two years, but Mason is flat wrong to say it spends anything.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s a tax reduction, not a spending increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, what about the Google part, and that the bill is not about job creation?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMason has a point about job creation -- but only to a point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/fe/JR1AB-7fe.pdf\">rated</a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/fe/JR1AB-7fe.pdf\"> as </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/fe/JR1AB-7fe.pdf\">False</a> a job creation claim by Walker, who had said the bill would allow businesses to create new jobs. We found the average tax credit would be $145. And some small business owners would get as little as $1.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn advancing the measure, neither Walker nor GOP leaders have said anything about improving how Wisconsin shows up in Google searches being a goal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMason told us he is basing his claim on comments Klenke, the freshman lawmaker, made in the committee meeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we don&rsquo;t have to rely on Mason&rsquo;s characterization of what Klenke said. We can go to the <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/ArchiveList.aspx?cm=201\">video</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKlenke, who joined the Assembly after defeating two-term Democratic incumbent Jim Soletski in November 2010, said the bill was a way to show Wisconsin is &quot;open for business.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn referencing Google, he told the committee:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you Google &lsquo;business climate in the state of Wisconsin,&rsquo; you will find that the state of Wisconsin has dropped 16 spots and is now number 42 in business friendliness.&quot; (True -- five-year drop: <a href=\"http://www.chiefexecutive.net/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=59FD13C5177B40B0B2D3EBA9E4384572&amp;AudID=F242408EE36A4B18AABCEB1289960A07\">CEO Magazine 2010 survey</a>)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKlenke went on to say that Wisconsin ranks among the 10 states with the highest overall tax burden (True as of 2008: <a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/335.html\">Tax Foundation study</a>); is one of the 10 states most likely to go bankrupt (Not quite -- Wisconsin in &quot;fiscal peril&quot;: <a href=\"http://downloads.pewcenteronthestates.org/BeyondCalifornia.pdf\">Pew Center 2009 report</a>); and is one of the least attractive states for retirees (True: <a href=\"http://www.topretirements.com/blog/great-towns/our-worst-states-to-retire-list.html/\">TopRetirements.com 2010 rankings</a>).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What we are trying to do,&quot; Klenke said about the tax credits measure, &quot;is change the trend.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview, Klenke told us the tax credits bill is one action the state could take to improve Wisconsin&rsquo;s business climate. If more such steps are taken, people who use Google to learn about Wisconsin&rsquo;s business climate will get more positive information, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, he framed it in terms of the state&rsquo;s overall business trends and what people may find when they use Google for a search -- not around getting a higher-ranking on a Google search, as the news release headline suggests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Note: The tax credits bill was amended after it was considered by the Assembly jobs committee. The changes would make more businesses eligible for the credits, but with a smaller estimated loss -- $33.5 million per year -- in state revenue, according to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/2011-13Bills/2011_01_20JFC_SUB_SSSB7_SSAB7.pdf\">memo</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe amended bill, which would net businesses an estimated $92 to $316 for each new job created, was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/114287604.html\">approved</a> Jan. 20, 2011 by the Joint Finance Committee and sent it to the full Assembly.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo need to search for our conclusion. Here it is:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMason was flat wrong when he said the tax credits bill &quot;spends $80 million.&quot; The bill would not spend any money; it would reduce state revenue by nearly $80 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn his larger point, it does not appear the tax credits alone would create jobs. But Mason cherry picks and trivializes comments by one GOP lawmaker -- Klenke -- to suggest the aim of the tax credits is to improve Google searches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn our analysis, Mason&rsquo;s claim contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
