Because it appears to have returned to heavy rotation, we decided to do a few fact checks from among its dozens of claims, all of which are critical of President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll check the claim that Obama is paying a pretty penny in taxpayer money -- specifically $102,000 a year -- to keep a dog trainer on retainer. The White House didn&#39;t respond to our inquiry, but we were able to piece the story together on our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presidents have a long history of family pets, dating all the way back to <a href=\"http://presidentialpetmuseum.com/presidents/01jw/\"><u>George Washington</u></a>, who kept dogs, horses and even a parrot. During his presidency, <a href=\"http://presidentialpetmuseum.com/presidents/26tr/\"><u>Theodore Roosevelt</u></a> housed enough animals to run a small petting zoo on the south lawn, including 13 horses, six dogs, several cats, and even such exotic animals as a zebra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Obama White House is certainly pet-friendly, but a little more tame: The Obamas have two Portuguese water dogs, <a href=\"http://presidentialpetmuseum.com/pets/bo/\"><u>Bo</u></a> and <a href=\"http://presidentialpetmuseum.com/blog/obamas-get-another-dog/\"><u>Sunny</u></a>. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., gave Bo as a gift to the Obamas in 2009 (fulfilling <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/502/get-his-daughters-a-puppy/\"><u>one of the newly inaugurated president&rsquo;s campaign promises</u></a>), and Sunny joined in August 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that the family adores Bo, but do they spend more than $100,000 per year to have a dog handler at their beck and call?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suggestions that the Obamas were spending lavishly on Bo circulated at least as far back as 2010. That&rsquo;s when bloggers claimed that Bo had flown solo to Maine in a private jet when the family took a trip there, based on an article in a local newspaper, the <em>Morning Sentinel</em>, which had reported that Bo had arrived &quot;in a small jet before the Obamas&quot; along with &quot;the president&#39;s personal aide, Reggie Love.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We and others <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/22/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-bo-flies-his-own-plane/\"><u>debunked</u></a> the claim that Bo flew on his own airplane. In reality, the airport in Waterville, Maine, could not accommodate Obama&rsquo;s usual airplane, so Obama and his staff flew into a different airport on separate jets, one of which carried several members of Obama&rsquo;s presidential staff and Bo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Sentinel </em>later issued a correction: &quot;Today&#39;s story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obamas&#39; dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t enough to stop pieces of the rumor from morphing into another outrageous claim about Bo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of these rumors focused on Love, who holds a job known informally as the presidential &quot;body man&quot; -- a position that combines aspects of scheduler, valet, and conversational partner.<strong> </strong>Love began to work for Obama in 2006 and served as the president&rsquo;s personal aide from 2009 until 2011. That meant that he was at Obama&rsquo;s side almost constantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the <em>Morning Sentinel</em> listed Love as Bo&rsquo;s one and only traveling companion, some bloggers incorrectly assumed (or willfully spread the fiction) that his job was &quot;dog trainer.&quot; Meanwhile, a 2011 <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov//briefing-room/disclosures/annual-records/2011\"><u>report to Congress</u></a> confirmed that Love was paid $102,000 a year. Love&rsquo;s salary matches that listed in the chain email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Love was far from a dog trainer. His job was to provide any necessary personal assistance and arrangements for the leader of the Free World. The notion that Obama was keeping a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year is nonsense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In tracking Bo&rsquo;s history, we did find references to one trainer, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011406691.html\"><u>Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz</u></a>, who trained the dog before his introduction to the presidential lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sylvia-Stasiewicz was known for training dogs who lived among Washington&rsquo;s politicians, including Kennedy&rsquo;s family,<strong> </strong>who took Bo to her before giving the dog to the Obamas. According to the <em>Washington Post</em>, the Kennedy&rsquo;s worked with Sylvia-Stasiewicz to determine &quot;whether the dog would be suitable for a very busy family with two young daughters.&quot; By her own admission, Sylvia-Stasiewicz was unaware that the dogs&rsquo; final destination would be the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, according to the &quot;Annual Reports to Congress on White House Staff,&quot; she was never paid by the Obama administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chain email said that &quot;Obama is the first president to keep a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense.&quot; The claim stitches together a few pieces of accurate information in a way that makes them inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dog trainer, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, has been associated with Bo, but she was used briefly and was never paid by the administration. Meanwhile, Reggie Love was an Obama aide who earned $102,000, but to the extent that dog handling took any of his time, it was a small fraction of his total duties, and &quot;dog handler&quot; certainly wasn&rsquo;t his title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-18T16:36:59.093530", "ruling_date": "2014-06-18T16:43:03", "ruling_headline": "Does Obama have a 'dog-trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-obama-have-dog-trainer-retainer-102000-year-t", "ruling_link_text": "A claim unleashed from reality", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Red Flag News, <a href=\"http://www.redflagnews.com/headlines/a-comprehensive-list-of-obamas-accomplishments-as-first-black-president-of-the-united-states-of-america\"><u>Updated: The Comprehensive List of Obama&rsquo;s Accomplishments As First Black President Of The United States Of America</u></a>, Jan. 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Morning Sentinel</em>, <a href=\"http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/white-house-wanderers-tour-acadia_2010-07-16.html\"><u>White House wanderers tour Acadia</u></a>, by Rebekah Metzler, July 17, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011406691.html\"><u>Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, trainer of Bo, the Obamas&#39;
