The middle class not only suffered tremendously during the great recession and is suffering as we emerge from it, but was under a great deal of pressure even prior to the recession. While incomes were growing rapidly under the previous administration and the economy was expanding, middle-class incomes were flat, stagnant, and even dropping. So that was one observation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And another is that . . . as the president talks about a lot, education could be the key, the defining element of whether or not the United States of America can compete globally in the 21st century -- compete and win. &nbsp;We think it&rsquo;s a high, high priority. &nbsp;And I was struck by the absence of attention to that very key issue last night.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCarney&#39;s comment was a Democratic talking point on the day after the debate. The Democratic National Committee issued a Web video called &nbsp;&quot;What in the world are they talking about?&quot; that made the same point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo were Carney and the DNC right? We checked the debate transcript and found that Carney is technically correct that the words &quot;middle class&quot; and &quot;education&quot; did not appear in the 21,798-word debate. But it&#39;s important to look more broadly and see whether the candidates used other words with the same meaning.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd indeed, we found the candidates made several references to middle-income Americans &mdash; they just used different words:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>\u25cf </strong>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty referred to America&rsquo;s &quot;middle-income and modest-income people&quot; when WMUR political reporter Josh McElveen questioned him on his plan to &quot;right the housing ship.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well, the first thing we need to do is get the government out of crony capitalism,&quot; Pawlenty said. &quot;We have this alliance between big government, big unions and certain big bailout businesses. And as Congressman Paul said a few minutes ago, we had politicians in Congress trying to micromanage the housing market, and they created a bubble and they created the mess. And now we have all these innocent bystanders, the good people of the United States of America, many middle-income and modest-income people, who&#39;ve been devastated by this.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>\u25cf&nbsp; </strong>Pawlenty also mentioned &quot;blue-collar communities&quot; as he cited his upbringing in a &quot;meat packing&quot; and &nbsp;&quot;manufacturing&quot; town with a father who worked as a &quot;Teamster truck driver&quot; for much of his life.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpeaking about a plan to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S., Pawlenty said, &quot;I understand what it&#39;s like to see the blue-collar communities and the struggles that they&#39;ve had when manufacturing leaves. So I&#39;ve seen that firsthand. But No. 1, we&#39;ve got to have fair trade, and what&#39;s going on right now is not fair.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>\u25cf&nbsp; </strong>We counted three references to the middle class by former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who spoke of the &quot;broad middle of America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I always am from Pennsylvania,&quot; Santorum said. &quot;We still make things there, and I represented the Steel Valley of Pittsburgh when I was in the Congress. And what I learned from growing up in Butler, Pa., steel town is that the broad middle of America was a broad middle of America when we had lots of manufacturing here because that&#39;s how the wealth from those who create the jobs get down. &hellip; We want to encourage people to set up jobs here in America. Take that R&amp;D credit, make it permanent, take that innovation and then invest that money here to create that broad middle of America and have that wealth really trickle down.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn education, however, Carney was correct. We couldn&#39;t find any reference to the subject during the debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, it&#39;s important to note that the candidates didn&#39;t choose the topics for questions. That was done by CNN host John King, New Hampshire journalists and voters. They chose not to ask about education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, King started the debate reminding candidates of the rules, saying, &quot;We&#39;ve also asked the candidates to answer the questions that they&#39;re asked, rather than the question they might have wished to be asked.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCarney was technically correct that education and the middle class were not mentioned in the debate. But several times candidates made references to middle-income people using other terms. And they never got asked about education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
