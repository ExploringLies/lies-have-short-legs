The union represents bus drivers, mechanics and support staff for the Portland-area&rsquo;s public transit system. The two sides are in contract negotiations.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe union&rsquo;s large-size <a href=\"http://www.transitvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ATU-5.jpg\">ad</a>, which appeared in The Oregonian and other publications, takes aim at TriMet for what union leaders describe as squandered spending. For example, the ad says TriMet spends $10.3 million a year for transit police who are rarely around.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;We love our transit police officers. They are competent and caring. But we seldom see them. This is because they must respond to non-transit calls. When we ask what these 56 officers do for $10 million per year, TriMet&rsquo;s response is that it doesn&rsquo;t audit performance under the contracts,&quot; reads the ad, titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.transitvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ATU-5.jpg\">TriMet</a><a href=\"http://www.transitvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ATU-5.jpg\"> Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?&quot; </a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea who handles security on MAX and buses, or how duties are allocated. So we were game to check it out. Does TriMet pay $10 million a year for 56 transit officers who respond to non-transit calls and aren&rsquo;t around much?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTriMet&rsquo;s public affairs department says the assertions are inaccurate. It issued a <a href=\"http://news.trimet.org/2013/06/fact-check-trimet-financial-problems-self-inflicted/\">point-by-point rebuke</a>that you can read on its website. The transit agency says that the Transit Police Division has 62 sworn law enforcement officers on contract, led by a Portland Police commander. In 2011-12, TriMet budgeted $8.64 million -- of which $8.15 million was spent on salaries, benefits, insurance and vehicles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhile waiting for <a href=\"http://www.atu757.org/president.html\">Bruce Hansen, union president</a>, to return our calls and emails, we decided to take a look-see into the TriMet budget adopted for <a href=\"http://trimet.org/pdfs/publications/FY14-adopted-budget.pdf\">2013-14</a>. Because we&rsquo;re not really sure why TriMet cites 2011-12 numbers in response to a claim made in June 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe scrolled through the budget and found on page SS-5, $10.2 million for police security contracts. A follow-up conversation with TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch illuminated that the security contract costs are even higher -- there&rsquo;s just over $500,000 for the canine unit -- for a total of $10.7 million.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo, the transit union appears to be pretty spot on with the dollar amount. TriMet says the number of officers is 62, not 56, as stated in the ads.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHansen said that they relied on information received from TriMet through public records requests. He&rsquo;s not sure why TriMet is using 2011-12 figures either. TriMet says that&rsquo;s what the union requested. We&rsquo;ll leave that alone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNow, what about the union&rsquo;s assertion that transit police have to respond to non-transit calls?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTriMet has policing contracts with 17 law enforcement agencies in the region. Each agency contributes a set number of officers who make up the Transit Police Division. The number may change based on officer availability, but Portland Police provides the largest number of officers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTransit police is a contracted service, but it&rsquo;s not unlike other police divisions. Officers apply for a post. They serve multi-year terms. Members are expected to patrol vehicles and stations and enforce TriMet ordinances, such as not smoking at shelters and at MAX platforms.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe union suggests that the public is not getting enough value for the amount of money spent on transit police. We have no idea if that&rsquo;s a fair accusation, although TriMet says transit police spend at least 70 percent of their contracted time on transit related matters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTriMet has been much in the news. The Oregonian has reported on <a href=\"http://projects.oregonlive.com/trimet/\">sleepy drivers behind the wheel</a>, sneakily distributed pay raises <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2013/03/trimet_execs_received_big_pay.html\">for executives </a>and managers and historic fare increases and service cutbacks. In other words, we&rsquo;re sure TriMet has way more problems to worry about than a mere $10 million transit police contract, <a href=\"http://trimet.org/budget/\">out of a $485 million operating budget for Fiscal Year 2014</a>, which starts July 1.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s go to the ruling. The agency has budgeted $10.2 million for police contracts. The budgeted amount is $10.7 million if you include the canine program. We think those numbers are pretty close to the $10.3 million cited by the union. The number of officers is 62 according to TriMet, which again, we don&rsquo;t see as being that significantly different from 56.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAre transit police seldom seen? That&rsquo;s not something we can rule on. We suppose that is in the eye of the beholder. Must transit police respond to non-transit related calls? Yes, that&rsquo;s because they are sworn officers who must respond to whatever calls roll in, just like any law enforcement officer on the job.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe statement is accurate but needs clarification as to number of officers and why they&rsquo;re not dedicated solely to TriMet. We rule the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-21T18:44:12.949938", "ruling_date": "2013-06-22T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Does TriMet spend $10 million a year for transit police to respond to non-transit calls?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-trimet-spend-10-million-year-transit-police-r", "ruling_link_text": "Sworn officers must respond to all calls", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-15046831-68e7-f452-7436-8eccde019e54\">\r\n\tAmalgamated Transit Union, <a href=\"http://www.atu757.org/\">Local 757 </a>(accessed June 17, 2013)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTransitVoice.org, <a href=\"http://www.transitvoice.org/read-the-latest-open-letter-from-trimet-transit-workers/\">&quot;TriMet Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?&quot;</a></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTriMet, &quot;Fact Check: &quot;<a href=\"http://news.trimet.org/2013/06/fact-check-trimet-financial-problems-self-inflicted/\">TriMet</a><a href=\"http://news.trimet.org/2013/06/fact-check-trimet-financial-problems-self-inflicted/\"> Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?&quot; </a>June 13, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTriMet, <a href=\"http://trimet.org/pdfs/publications/security.pdf\">&quot;Security essential to regional transit system</a>&quot; (accessed June 17, 2013)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTriMet, &quot;<a href=\"http://media.trimet.org/trimet-increases-security-presence-highlights-fare-enforcement-measures/\">TriMet</a><a href=\"http://media.trimet.org/trimet-increases-security-presence-highlights-fare-enforcement-measures/\"> increases security presence; highlights fare enforcement measures</a>,&quot; Oct. 30, 2012</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCity of Portland, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?a=386867&amp;c=57945\">Intergovernmental agreement between the City of Portland and the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon</a>,&quot; September 2010; September 2012</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCity of Portland, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?a=386866&amp;c=57945\">Intergovernmental agreement among the tri-county Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, the City of Portland and the City of Beaverton for transit police services</a>,&quot; May 19, 2010</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://cascadepolicy.org/pdf/TrimetResolution4-28-10.pdf\">Memos </a>from Fred Hansen to TriMet Board of Directors, April 28, June 23, 2010</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterview with and emails from Roberta Altstadt and Mary Fetsch, public affairs, TriMet, June 13, 17-21, 2013 &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTriMet, <a href=\"http://trimet.org/pdfs/publications/FY14-adopted-budget.pdf\">2013-14 adopted budget</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterview with Bruce Hansen, president, Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 757, June 20, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterview with Harry Saporta, <a href=\"http://howweroll.trimet.org/author/harrytrimet/\">TriMet Safety and Security Executive</a>, June 21, 2013</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2347, "last_name": "Amalgamated Transit Union", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "amalgamated-transit-union", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ATU.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2347/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays TriMet spends &quot;$10.3 million in police contracts&quot; a year for 56 transit police who must respond to non-transit calls</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a newspaper ad", "statement_date": "2013-06-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 173, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/173/", "subject": "Public Safety", "subject_slug": "public-safety", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 206, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/206/", "subject": "Unions", "subject_slug": "unions", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
