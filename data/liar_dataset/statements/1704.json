Rick  Perry, hailed by many conservatives who see Democrats in Washington as  trampling on states' rights, told an interviewer for the Texas Tribune  and Newsweek magazine last week that his public endorsement of a 2009  Texas House resolution on state sovereignty was not covered by  mainstream news organizations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Perry said: &ldquo;We had a press  conference here that interestingly no one in the mainstream media  covered.\"</p>\r\n<p>We wondered if Perry accurately recapped the April 9,  2009, news conference at which he endorsed a concurrent resolution  authored by state Rep. Brandon Creighton stating the  Legislature claims \"sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the  Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise  enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of  the United States.\"</p>\r\n<p>Perry&rsquo;s office didn&rsquo;t respond to our request  for elaboration on the media presence at the press conference.</p>\r\n<p>Next,  we found indications the news conference was covered by at least two media outlets  -- the Austin American-Statesman and the Associated Press. Currently,  more than 100 Texas newspapers and more than 150 Texas broadcast outlets  are AP members and get its dispatches, according to Dale Leach, AP's  Dallas bureau chief.</p>\r\n<p>Leach said the AP distributed five photos taken by a staff photographer who attended the press conference.</p>\r\n<p>The 246-word AP report on the press  conference, sent out at 5:53 p.m. that day, quotes Perry saying: &ldquo;I  believe that our federal government has become oppressive. I believe  it's become oppressive in its size, its intrusion into the lives of our  citizens and its interference with the affairs of our state.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The  article also states: &ldquo;Answering a question from a news reporter, Perry  suggested that (U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey) Hutchison,&rdquo; then poised to  challenge Perry in the 2010 GOP primary for governor, &ldquo;is part of the  federal government's expansion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Our hunch: The mentioned  reporter was Ken Herman, then a staff writer in the Austin  American-Statesman&rsquo;s Capitol bureau. Herman posted a blog and video from  Perry&rsquo;s press conference at 3:10 p.m. the same day; both remain online.</p>\r\n<p>According to the video, Perry took questions from Herman, who  asked if Perry included Hutchison among active participants in expanding  federal powers. Perry said she'd be among individuals in that category.  Herman also asked if Perry could specify ways Hutchison had supported  expansions in federal powers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you the long and distinguished  list of those shortly,&rdquo; Perry said.</p>\r\n<p>We found one Statesman news  article that could explain why Perry says no one from the mainstream  media covered the press conference. The article by Jason Embry of the  Statesman&rsquo;s Capitol staff -- published a week after the event -- states  that Perry's remarks gave him a bounce in national attention even though  the resolution itself &ldquo;barely drew a mention in the print editions of  the state&rsquo;s daily newspapers&rdquo; the day after the press conference.</p>\r\n<p>So,  how does Perry&rsquo;s recap stand up?</p>\r\n<p>The AP and the Statesman are  clearly part of the mainstream media. We rate Perry's statement as  False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-19T18:05:12.100207", "ruling_date": "2010-04-19T20:01:28", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
