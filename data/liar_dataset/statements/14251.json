It has functioned like a &quot;<a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6002/356\">primary control knob</a>&quot; that&rsquo;s been dialed up dramatically since humans began releasing significantly more amounts of CO2 into the air, mostly by burning fossil fuels, at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A reasonable analogy can be drawn between the way that atmospheric CO2 controls the global temperature of the Earth, and how your house thermostat controls the temperature of your house,&quot; said Andrew Lacis, a climatologist at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NASA graph below shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, including a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750 (green line), on the Earth&rsquo;s temperature (black line).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XeEDmKpL7OedHPvzOcvC5y3R5gOd0T1EaWFdfw72t61f5YLX-g4YlVW_nhaO-2nfu0MkenyUmEKrBh9Ae7Ge5-u55efi1WQK4JSFXUww2dMVGLbQF-et-Uwy7oULMFNgi2tqTstG\" style=\"border:none; height:288px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, &quot;Most likely the primary control knob (for the earth&rsquo;s temperature) is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perry&rsquo;s claim contradicts settled science.
