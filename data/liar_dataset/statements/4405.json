A 100-percent proficiency rate? The first time in the state&#39;s history? On multiple assessment tests?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;re selecting McKee as the person making the claim because he&#39;s a driving force in the school, known as Blackstone Valley Prep. He would be in the best position to know what the test scores are at his own academy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(A proposal by Fung to create a mayoral academy for Cranston and Providence was rejected Sept. 1 by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we turned to Elliot Krieger, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Education. He delved into the records and here&#39;s what he found going back to 2005, when the state inaugurated its current testing system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast May, all 152 first graders and kindergartners at the school passed the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA), a test developed in the late 1980s in Ohio to measure reading skills. In fact, 130 of those 152 passed with distinction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKrieger said it was the first instance he could find of any elementary school doing so well on the current state-mandated standardized tests or, as far as he could recall, since the state began doing proficiency testing, in 1998.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn May 2010 -- the school&rsquo;s inaugural year, when all the students were kindergartners -- 97 percent were deemed proficient.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They&#39;re doing really well. No one will dispute that,&quot; said Krieger. &quot;It&#39;s not a test where this is a cakewalk.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the mayors&rsquo; statement leaves out an important fact: The DRA is a test that very few students take because it is given only in schools that don&#39;t go above second grade. In all other elementary schools, the state uses the New England Common Assessment Program (NECAP), a series of reading, writing, math and science tests used by Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermomt and Maine. Those tests start in grade 3.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast year, only 6 of the state&#39;s 168 elementary schools took the DRA, which makes Blackstone Valley Prep a big fish in a very small pond.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are a lot of schools that are high-performing that don&#39;t take this test,&quot; said Krieger.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Blackstone Valley Prep did have a class of fifth graders last year and those students took the NECAP test, <a href=\"http://www.ride.ri.gov/assessment/DOCS/NECAP/Reports_Results/10.2010/Fall_2010_RI_NECAP_Results.pdf\">with less impressive results</a> -- 61 percent were proficient in reading and 48 percent were proficient in math, both below the state average. But Krieger said that doesn&#39;t reflect the quality of the school because the test was given in October 2010, before the students had spent much time there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They didn&#39;t teach those kids. It&#39;s testing them on what they learned the previous year, wherever they came from,&quot; Krieger said.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo when Mayors McKee, Fung and Avedisian say that the Blackstone Valley Mayoral Academy is &quot;the first public school in Rhode Island history to have 100 percent of its elementary-age students proficient&quot; on a state reading assessment, they&#39;re right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that statement might lead readers to assume a comparison with all elementary schools in Rhode Island. Instead, the Blackstone Valley students are taking a test that students in the vast majority of elementary schools don&rsquo;t take, an important qualifier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, the statement -- and its use of the plural &quot;assessments&quot; -- suggests that the students got 100 percent in more than one test, which is false.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause the statement is mostly accurate but leaves out those important details, we rate the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
