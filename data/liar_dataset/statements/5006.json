One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007 &quot;I like the GSE, or government sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich took the broad view to defend his position, saying &quot;when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we ask, was that a fair comparison? Are electric co-ops and credit unions the same as government sponsored enterprises, GSE&rsquo;s, like Freddie Mac?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.nreca.coop/Pages/default.aspx\">National Rural Electric Cooperative Association</a> (NRECA), said GSE &nbsp;&quot;is not a term that I&rsquo;ve heard applied to electric coops before.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNor, as we learned, would he be likely to. The term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp#axzz1gje81AHY\">Investopedia </a>define GSE&rsquo;s as &quot;(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE&rsquo;s, and the list isn&rsquo;t long. &nbsp;There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that&rsquo;s it. No electric co-ops.No credit unions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/gov.pdf\">2012 White House budget </a>explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate &quot;the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA credit union or an electric co-op is born completely differently. &nbsp;They come into being only when a group of local investors pool their money.The country&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.acumuseum.org/history.html\">very first credit union </a>was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to the factory workers in the textile mills. &nbsp;Washington played no role at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local groups need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entity. &nbsp;By the way, that&rsquo;s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by their members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930&rsquo;s when &quot;farmers would each throw $5 dollars into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate but a GSE such as Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit into the federal Treasury -- upwards of $2 billion. &quot;They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself,&quot; said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered the GSE&rsquo;s for over two decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says &quot;the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That&rsquo;s what allowed it to grow.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the Gingrich campaign to send us any source that describes a credit union or a electric co-op as a GSE. We did not hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohn Berlau, a policy director with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that supports limited government and free markets, says he knows of no such description. In an email, he wrote &quot;credit union officials I have talked to are fearful that Gingrich&#39;s false claim that they are a type of GSE may unjustly harm their image among the public and legislators.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our Ruling</strong>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE, &nbsp;by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich was paid by Freddie Mac to provide strategic advice, so he should be familiar with government sponsored entities and know what is and isn&rsquo;t a GSE. &nbsp;But Gingrich got it wrong twice during the debate in Iowa.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rule his claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-19T16:21:05.579202", "ruling_date": "2011-12-19T16:19:06", "ruling_headline": "Newt Gingrich says Freddie Mac, electric co-ops and credit unions are similar organizations", "ruling_headline_slug": "newt-gingrich-says-freddie-mac-electric-coo-ops-an", "ruling_link_text": "No. Not really", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp#axzz1gje81AHY\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6189955265025494\">Definition of Government Sponsored Enterprise</a>, Investopedia, accessed Dec. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.freddiemac.com/governance/pdf/charter.pdf\">Public Law No. 91-351, 84 Stat. 450</a> (creating Freddie Mac), accessed Dec. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/gov.pdf\"> White House budget for FY 2012</a> - Section on GSE&rsquo;s., accessed Dec. 17, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.nreca.org/members/History/Pages/default.aspx\">History of Electric Coops</a>, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, accessed Dec. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/CharteringAndFOMForms/NCUA_4008.pdf\">Application for Credit Union Registration</a>, National Credit Union Association, accessed Dec. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/28xx/doc2841/GSEs.pdf\">Federal Subsidies and the Housing GSE&rsquo;s</a>, Congressional Budget Office, May 2001, accessed Dec. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=5758495-17422-125144&amp;type=sect&amp;TabIndex=2&amp;companyid=7848&amp;ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcik%253d310522\">Federal National Mortgage Association 10K</a>, Feb. 27, 2008, accessed 12/19/2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.acumuseum.org/history.html\">History of Credit Unions in the U.S.</a>, American Credit Union Museum, accessed 12/18/2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPatrick Levine, Spokesperson, <a href=\"http://www.nreca.coop/Pages/default.aspx\">National Rural Electric Cooperative Association,</a> interviewed Dec. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKathleen Day, former Washington Post reporter, interviewed Dec. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohn Berlau, Director, Center for Investors and Entrepreneurs, <a href=\"http://cei.org/about-cei\">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>, interviewed Dec. 16 and 17, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Newt", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 152, "last_name": "Gingrich", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "newt-gingrich", "pants_count": 12, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gingrichcutter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/152/", "total_count": 86, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Freddie Mac, electric co-ops and credit unions are all &quot;government sponsored&quot; enterprises.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa", "statement_date": "2011-12-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 153, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/153/", "subject": "Financial Regulation", "subject_slug": "financial-regulation", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 214, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/214/", "subject": "New Hampshire 2012", "subject_slug": "new-hampshire-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
