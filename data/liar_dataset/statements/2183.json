Kendrick Meek an opportunity to bring up a recent <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> story that said Greene went on his yacht to Cuba, and that crew members recalled extensive partying. Greene said he wasn&#39;t there. (Watch the entire exchange <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/components/video/meek-bores-in-on-greenes-trip-to-cuba/374746581001/2652468001/\">here</a>).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t know if I need to slide my chair over, because a bolt of lightning may come in and hit Jeff,&#39;&#39; Meek said. &quot;You&#39;re saying you weren&#39;t on your yacht, when it went to Cuba and eyewitnesses said you were on the yacht?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No,&quot; Greene responded. &quot;I went to Cuba years ago on a Jewish mission to Cuba, yes, for the Jewish community.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Were you on the yacht when it was reported &hellip;&quot; Meek pressed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No, not that time &hellip; I was not on the yacht on the trip you&#39;re talking about. I was on the yacht on another time when I had a visa to go there and visit the Jewish community,&quot; Greene stammered as Meek cross-examined him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo recap the exchange, Greene said that he wasn&#39;t on the boat during the trip mentioned in the story (the 2007 &quot;party&quot; trip) but that he did visit Cuba another time, had a visa and did humanitarian work in the Jewish community. We&#39;ll call that version No. 1.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Hours later</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tImmediately after the debate, Greene acknowledged he may have gone to Cuba in 2007. Greene said the Jewish Federation had obtained a visa for him to visit Cuba, the <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> reported, and that he and other members of the federation visited a synagogue. No partying though. &quot;Who would you party with?&quot; he quipped.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRecapping Greene&#39;s revised recollection, the 2007 trip that Greene said he wasn&#39;t on, he now says he may have been on. But there was no partying, and Greene was there on a humanitarian mission to visit the country&#39;s Jewish synagogues. Let&#39;s call that version No. 2.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Later in the week</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Aug. 3, as more questions kept coming about the Cuba trip, the partying -- a deck hand reported the boat being &quot;caked&quot; in vomit from all the partying -- and Greene&#39;s humanitarian mission, spokesman Luis Vizcaino clarified&nbsp;that Greene&#39;s yacht stopped at a Havana marina in 2007 not for a party, and not for a humanitarian mission, but because the <i>Summerwind </i>was in need of repairs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;During the debate Jeff misspoke,&quot; Vizcaino said. &quot;What he meant to say was that in 2007, he went on the boat from Honduras to the Bahamas, and en route the boat had a hydraulic problem. &hellip; The captain said we could wait for the part at Hemingway Marina.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile docked in Havana, Greene went to visit a synagogue because he had heard about a Jewish humanitarian mission. &quot;He didn&#39;t meet up with them,&quot; Vizcaino said. &quot;He wanted to observe. &hellip; What he came away with was firsthand knowledge of the plight of the country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVizcaino, when asked about the Jewish Federation visa, said of Greene, &quot;again, he misspoke.&quot; The Greene campaign produced a letter from the <i>Summerwind</i>&#39;s chief engineer corroborating the campaign&#39;s latest thoughts -- the boat malfunctioned on the way to the Bahamas, went to see a Cuban synagogue while we waited -- which we&#39;re calling version No. 3. Another crew member disputes that version of events <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/jeff-greene-corrects-course-remembers-yachting-to-cuba-but-not-the-partying/1112879\" id=\"j4_q\" title=\"in comments to the St. Petersburg Times.\">in comments to the <i>St. Petersburg Times.</i></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should also note that the Greene press release on Aug. 4&nbsp;attempting to clarify the trip said that &quot;Jeff and his then-fiancee, now wife, were en route to Honduras,&quot; which means headed to Honduras, which is the opposite of what Greene, Vizcaino and the chief engineer say happened.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s at least three significantly different versions of one story, crafted in three days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst Greene wasn&#39;t on the trip, then he said he was -- but that it was a humanitarian trip. Then the trip was a detour because of hydraulic issues.&nbsp; Our definition of a Full Flop is &quot;A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop.&quot; In this case, that sounds just right. We rate Greene&#39;s statements on whether and why he went to Cuba a Full Flop.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-04T16:59:28.398000", "ruling_date": "2010-08-04T18:02:35", "ruling_headline": "Jeff Greene's Cuba trip ... business or pleasure?", "ruling_headline_slug": "jeff-greenes-cuba-trip-business-or-pleasure", "ruling_link_text": "Yacht gets Greene in trouble again", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tKendrick Meek campaign, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBqhYq-SrJw\" id=\"fv0y\" title=\"WPLG TV report\">WPLG TV report</a>, Aug. 3, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKendrick Meek campaign, <a href=\"http://www.kendrickmeek.com/index.php/weblog/archive/jeff_greenes_crisis_of_memory_the_cuba_edition_2007/\" id=\"fj2b\" title=\"Jeff Greene's Crisis of Memory: The Cuba Edition 2007\">Jeff Greene&#39;s Crisis of Memory: The Cuba Edition 2007</a>, Aug. 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSt. Petersburg Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/31/v-fullstory/1755919/jeff-greene-a-self-made-mystery.html\" id=\"b_86\" title=\"Jeff Greene: A Self-Made Mystery\">Jeff Greene: A Self-Made Mystery</a>,&quot; Aug. 1, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJeff Greene press release, &quot;<a href=\"http://capitalsoup.com/2010/08/04/jeff-greene-for-u-s-senate-meeks-phony-issues-wont-distract-from-record-of-corruption/\" id=\"jyga\" title=\"Jeff Greene For U.S. Senate: Meek\u2019s Phony Issues Won't Distract From Record Of Corruption\">Jeff Greene For U.S. Senate: Meek&#39;s Phony Issues Won&#39;t Distract From Record Of Corruption</a>,&quot; Aug. 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSt. Petersburg Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/greene-and-meek-dont-hide-ill-will-in-debate/1112596\" id=\"x7dz\" title=\"Greene and Meek don't hide ill will in debate\">Greene and Meek don&#39;t hide ill will in debate</a>,&quot; Aug. 2, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSt. Petersburg Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/jeff-greene-corrects-course-remembers-yachting-to-cuba-but-not-the-partying/1112879\" id=\"a80f\" title=\"Jeff Greene corrects course, remembers yachting to Cuba, but not the partying\">Jeff Greene corrects course, remembers yachting to Cuba, but not the partying</a>, &quot; Aug. 3, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "businessman", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Jeff", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 422, "last_name": "Greene", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "jeff-greene", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Debate630_2_472953a.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/422/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.jeffgreeneforflorida.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tJeff Greene on why he&nbsp;went Cuba.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments to the media.", "statement_date": "2010-08-03", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 35, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/35/", "subject": "Ethics", "subject_slug": "ethics", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
