Next, Adler said in his tweet, accompanied by a photo of the Jeopardy clue:&nbsp;&quot;What is the safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is all of that true about Austin?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all: In 2017,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/aug/24/steve-adler/steve-adler-calls-austin-safest-big-city-Texas-cri/\">we found Half True</a>&nbsp;an&nbsp;Adler reference to Austin as the state&#39;s safest big city. Not for the first time, we noted then that the <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use\">FBI advises against</a> using crime data it collects to declare one city &quot;safer&quot; than another. That said, such statistics at the time suggested both that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions and that El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Seeking mayor&rsquo;s factual backup</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The morning after Adler posted his comment, which was retweeted more than 200 times, we reached mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford. Stanford advised by phone that Adler didn&rsquo;t have fresh information to offer in support of his 2018 &quot;safest big city in Texas&quot; statement. He&nbsp;suggested we check federal statistics to confirm Austin&rsquo;s jobless rate and told us that U.S. News had&nbsp;consecutively named Austin the nation&rsquo;s best place to live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Checking Austin&rsquo;s unemployment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our search for Austin&rsquo;s jobless rate on the Texas Workforce Commission website showed that from January through March 2018, the latest month of available data, the city&#39;s jobless rate ran shy of 3 percent. We also fetched a longer view showing the city&rsquo;s jobless rate mostly staying below 3 percent from January 2017 on (all the rates not seasonally adjusted).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Austin&#39;s unemployment rate was last above 3 percent, according to the TWC, when it was 3.1 percent in August 2017. The Austin rate&#39;s 15-month low, 2.5 percent, occurred in December 2017:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8tKkqN572LikFRniQ-sDYoP2ldmGVj_x90hikXdYg_Q1YmksfG7gJLzkTy22x-J7rXGFZ5avls7Xgt4fEV0xjnzYDViRK0R7scU33y3EsR8DC8oT8gII3vb3L-0a_A-TEGRSVI_O\" style=\"border:1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); float:left; height:368px; margin:2px 0px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>SOURCE:</strong></em> Website,<a href=\"http://www.tracer2.com/cgi/dataanalysis/AreaSelection.asp?tableName=Labforce\"> &quot;Unemployment,&quot;</a> Texas Labor Market Information, Texas Workforce Commission (search completed April 26, 2018)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Austin ranked best place to live two times in a row</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 10, 2018, U.S. News<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2018-04-10/us-news-unveils-the-2018-best-places-to-live\"> announced</a> that for the second straight year, the online publication found Austin the best place to live in the United States among the country&#39;s 125 largest metropolitan areas;<a href=\"https://realestate.usnews.com/places/colorado/colorado-springs\"> Colorado Springs, Colo.,</a> placed second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rankings were based on affordability, job prospects and quality of life, U.S. News said, and on surveying thousands of U.S. residents &quot;to find out what qualities they consider important in a home town. The methodology,&quot; U.S. News said, also factored in data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI and the Bureau of Labor Statistics--plus U.S. News rankings of the country&rsquo;s high schools and hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Austin, the self-proclaimed Live Music Capital of the planet, <a href=\"https://realestate.usnews.com/places/texas/austin\">earned</a> a score of 7.7 out of 10 for the 2018 rankings, U.S. News said, with even its few downsides having upsides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story says: &quot;The median sale price for a single-family home in Austin is well above the national median.&quot; Then again, the story says, &quot;Austinites&#39; pocketbooks benefit from no personal or corporate income tax, and a low state and local tax rate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another semi-warning in the story: &quot;Summers in Austin take some getting used to, with temperatures often scorching.&quot; Though, the story says, the &quot;metro area experiences mild weather throughout the rest of the year, though temperatures have been known to drop in the winter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story also notes: &quot;Austin is among the nation&#39;s worst metro areas for traffic congestion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, the story says, that &quot;can be addressed with flexible work schedules, due diligence when choosing a neighborhood and, for those wanting to get in some exercise while commuting, using public transportation, walking and biking.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adler referred to Austin as the &quot;safest big city in Texas with an unemployment rate under 3% that has been named the best place to live in the entire United States two years running.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hizzoner\">Hizzoner</a> was right about Austin&rsquo;s jobless rate of late and Austin getting&nbsp;named the city&rsquo;s best place to live two years in a row though it&rsquo;s worth clarifying that the rankings considered only the country&rsquo;s 125 largest metro areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether Austin is the safest big Texas city rests on interpreting crime data the FBI counsels against using to compare communities. This said, we previously found that the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions while in the first half of 2016, El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate this Adler claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
