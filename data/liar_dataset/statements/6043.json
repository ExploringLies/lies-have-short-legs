How did Mandel cut it? Setting the state budget is the job of the governor and General Assembly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look and put the question to Mandel&rsquo;s campaign. They backed up the statement by citing a report released by the treasurer&#39;s office last July after a self-described &quot;top to bottom review&quot; from his first six months in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;By targeting waste and improving operations,&quot; it says, the treasurer&rsquo;s office ended the 2011 fiscal year with a $400,000 surplus that was returned to the general fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe general revenue fund operating budget for the 2012-13 biennium was reduced by $1.2 million, the report says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reductions in expenses range from $2,000 that had been used for an outside contract for a plant-watering service to $850,000 saved by reducing budgeted full-time employees from 140 to 127.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at supporting documentation from the Legislative Service Commission and Office of Budget and Management, and at news coverage of treasurer&#39;s office operations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe coverage included reports that the treasurer&rsquo;s overall budget had actually increased, from $38.3 million in fiscal 2011 to $41 million in 2012, the current fiscal year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking more closely, however, we found that the treasurer&rsquo;s overall budget includes state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer&#39;s office. The <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=14gCUe0di-P5yQJk5bacUjhtJCBFJFzxtnR0_k-Ip8P2yAIbKBje5XL9XpRAa\">general revenue fund total</a>, the portion of the budget that covers operating expenses, does decrease from the 2010-2011 biennium to 2012-2013, according to the Legislative Service Commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe amount appropriated by the General Assembly for operating expenses -- the spending over which the treasurer has the most direct control -- decreased from $8.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $7.7 in fiscal 2012 and 2013, according to the legislative Service Commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does Mandel&rsquo;s claim that he &quot;cut the budget&quot; rate on the Truth-O-Meter?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis statement is accurate. His office finished the last fiscal year with a surplus and his office cited specific steps it took to spend less money. Also, the money appropriated for operating expenses for this fiscal year and the next fiscal year is reduced from the FY 2011 total.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is additional information, though, that provides clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs seen in the ad, some listeners might interpret his bare claim that he cut the budget as meaning he trimmed the state budget. Money for the state budget, including the treasurer&rsquo;s office, is set by the General Assembly and the governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the overall total appropriated for his office in FY 2012 and FY2013, when including state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer&#39;s office, is actually greater than FY 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel&rsquo;s claim rates Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-06T09:56:59.606626", "ruling_date": "2012-06-06T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Josh Mandel says as state treasurer he \"cut the budget\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "josh-mandel-says-state-treasurer-he-cut-budget", "ruling_link_text": "Doesn't set the budget, but did reduce internal spending", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJosh Mandel for U.S. Senate campaign, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSzAZlZBdMY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Change</a>,&quot; May 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislative Service Commission, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.lsc.state.oh.us/guidebook/chapter8.pdf\">The Ohio Budget Process</a>&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Revised Code, &quot;<a href=\"http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/113\">Chapter 113: Treasurer of State</a>&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail with Mandel staff, June 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Treasurer Josh Mandel, &quot;<a href=\"http://tos.ohio.gov/Documents/CMS/About_Reports/Top%20Bottom%20Review%20Calendar%202011.PDF\">CY2011 Top-Bottom Review</a>,&quot; July 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ohio.com/news/ohiocentric/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-says-review-decreases-office-budget-1.255697\">Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel says review decreases office budget</a>,&quot; Jan. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Columbus Dispatch, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/07/12/mandel-tightens-money-belt.html\">Mandel Tightens Money Belt</a>,&quot; July 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDayton Daily News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/politics/treasurer-mandel-under-scrutiny-for-hiring-practices-1353196.html\">Treasurer Mandel under scrutiny for hiring practices</a>,&quot; March 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Office of Budget and Management, <a href=\"http://obm.ohio.gov/sectionpages/Budget/OperatingBudget.aspx\">Operating Budget</a>, FY 2012-13<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislative Service Commission, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.lsc.state.oh.us/fiscal/greenbooks129/tos.pdf\">Analysis of the Enacted Budget</a>,&quot; August 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Ohio treasurer", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Josh", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 612, "last_name": "Mandel", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "josh-mandel", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/612/", "total_count": 31, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.tos.ohio.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays he &quot;cut the budget.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign commercial", "statement_date": "2012-05-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
