Then, the story went, archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard determined that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II and recovered it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we found no legitimate news articles stating that such a sunken ship was recently discovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story included a photo of a rusted submarine. <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nazi-sub-found-in-great-lakes/\">Snopes </a>found in 2016 that the photo was an unrelated <a href=\"https://medium.com/war-is-boring/russia-is-finally-slicing-up-its-abandoned-radioactive-submarines-771bafa77465#.8ymfpuyes\">image</a> of a rusting, decommissioned Russian submarine from the Cold War era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story quoted Mark Carpenter, a supposed professor at the Niagara University. Thomas Burns, a spokesman for the university, said they do not have a professor by that name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coast Guard told PolitiFact that the story about a recent discovery of a Nazi submarine in the Great Lakes is false. However, something similar has happened in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Years ago the Navy brought a WWII submarine onto the Great Lakes and at some point sank the submarine. So there is a WWII submarine sunken in the Great Lakes, but the Coast Guard didn&rsquo;t work with Niagara University to recover a sunken WWII German submarine,&quot; the Coast Guard said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://abc7chicago.com/archive/9108423/\">ABC 7 Eyewitness News in Chicago</a> reported in 2013 about the history of a sunken German submarine in Lake Michigan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The German mine-laying sub U-C 97 was brought to the midwest on tour in the summer of 1919.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The U-Boat was on tour. It was kind of a post-war, &#39;we won&#39; tour, and so people got to go on to it and see it, and then as a condition of the armistice, it had to be sunk,&quot; Pritzker Military Library CEO Ken Clarke told ABC news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June of 1921, the sub was sunk by the military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in this case, the story declaring that a mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII was discovered in Great Lakes is made up.
