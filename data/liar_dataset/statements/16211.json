One observer -- an <a href=\"http://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/scott-galloway\">NYU business professor </a>-- compared it to the population of several states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire,&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1060147434809159680?s=09\">tweeted</a> Professor Scott Galloway who told PolitiFact that he wasn&rsquo;t involved in Amendment 4 in Florida. Galloway was talking about the states individually and not combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that it was difficult to pinpoint the number of felons who are now eligible to vote but estimates put it above the residential population of many smaller states.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Adding up the eligible felons</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://secondchancesfl.org/about/voting-restoration-amendment/\">Amendment 4</a>, approved by about <a href=\"https://floridaelectionwatch.gov/Amendments\">64 percent of voters</a>, amends the state Constitution to restore voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete the terms of their sentence including parole or probation. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida has previously had <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/apr/25/understanding-felon-voting-rights-restoration/\">one of the toughest processes in the nation</a> for felons to regain their voting rights, which involved waiting for years and then appearing before the governor and state Cabinet. The <a href=\"https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20181025/florida-felon-voting-rights-who-got-theirs-back-under-scott\">Palm Beach Post </a>found that the current Cabinet, made up entirely of Republicans, restored the voting rights of twice as many whites as blacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two leaders of organizations that advocated for Amendment 4 -- Marc Mauer at The Sentencing Project and Howard Simon at the ACLU of Florida -- wrote a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1om20yURi8GKBdtYUuur-R-RyAagoY1SvmWDWRYghVss/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs\">memo</a> in February that estimates how many felons could regain the right to vote. Their conclusion: as many as 1.4 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how they arrived at the figure:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They started with the total Florida disenfranchised population, which they estimated was about 1.7 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then they subtracted felons who are not eligible including those convicted of murder or felony sex crimes, those in prison or in jail, under probation or supervision or who have not paid fees, fines or victim restitution. That ultimately leaves a group of about 1.4 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are some factors that could bring that number lower including many of those felons have not paid restitution, fines or fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Florida, a 2007 analysis by the Department of Corrections found that of 80,000 people awaiting rights restoration <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/state-legislative-and-policy-reform-advance-voting-rights-formerly-incarcerated-persons-2007?redirect=voting-rights/state-legislative-and-policy-reform-advance-voting-rights-formerly-incarcerated-person\">nearly 40 percent </a>had not completed restitution payments, the ACLU and the Sentencing Project found. Failure to pay restitution would make them ineligible to vote. And if we apply the 40 percent level of non-payment, that could reduce the eligible population from 1.4 million to about 840,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/04/26/sharpton-leads-rally-capitol-support-florida-felon-voting-rights/554916002/\">Many</a> <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2018/10/25/nfl-players-coalition-fights-back-against-trump-ballot-box/1761365002/\">news</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/florida-passes-amendment-to-restore-felons-voting-rights/2018/11/06/403b2906-e233-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.b64f2069ccd3\">outlets</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/florida-to-gain-1-4-million-voters-if-felon-measure-passes-1540891801?utm_content=buffera4309&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">have</a> cited the 1.4 million figure.
