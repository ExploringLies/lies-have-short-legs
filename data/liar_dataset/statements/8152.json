Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. One of the issues they discussed was the high cost of health insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics, &nbsp;&quot;85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn&#39;t. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don&#39;t they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn&#39;t have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year.<strong> </strong>Why didn&#39;t they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this fact-check, we&rsquo;ll check whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. In a separate report, we&rsquo;ll look at his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-june-2013/\"><u>Kaiser Family Foundation&rsquo;s June 2013 health tracking poll</u></a> asked uninsured respondents for the main reason they didn&rsquo;t have health insurance, a plurality of 40 percent cited cost. The second-biggest factor, at 26 percent, was related to employment, such as being unemployed or having a job that doesn&rsquo;t offer health insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two reasons aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive -- someone could have told the pollster that their lack of a job was the biggest reason but also find cost to be a barrier to obtaining insurance. The only answer in the poll that suggests the respondent doesn&rsquo;t face a cost obstacle is &quot;doesn&rsquo;t need insurance,&quot; which was the answer of only 11 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another survey, the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_255.pdf\"><u>2011 National Health Interview Survey</u></a>, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers asked, &quot;Which of these are reasons you stopped being covered or don&rsquo;t have health insurance?&rsquo;&rsquo; Respondents were allowed to choose more than one reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this survey, too, a plurality -- 42 percent -- cited cost. Three other reasons cited are compatible with cost being an obstacle -- a lost job or a change in employment (26 percent), an employer that didn&rsquo;t offer insurance (11 percent) and ineligible due to age or leaving school (9 percent). Just 6 percent cited &quot;other,&quot; which included &quot;didn&rsquo;t want or need coverage,&quot; among other answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The cost of insurance is a major reason why people are uninsured -- Sen. Paul is right about that,&quot; said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. &quot;People without access to employer-sponsored coverage have a hard time affording it on their own, and that accounts for most of the uninsured.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul asked, &quot;Why didn&#39;t (uninsured Americans) buy insurance? Because of the expense.&quot; Survey data supports him. A plurality of respondents in major surveys of the uninsured specifically cite cost as a barrier, and relatively few indicate that going uninsured is a voluntary choice. We rate Paul&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-14T10:43:43.170679", "ruling_date": "2013-08-15T15:11:52", "ruling_headline": "Rand Paul, on 'Daily Show,' says cost is biggest barrier for the uninsured", "ruling_headline_slug": "rand-paul-daily-show-says-cost-biggest-barrier-uni", "ruling_link_text": "Surveys confirm cost is biggest obstacle", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rand Paul,<a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/mon-august-12-2013-rand-paul\"> <u>interview on Comedy Central&rsquo;s<em> The Daily Show</em></u></a>, Aug. 12, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_255.pdf\"><u>Summary Health Statistics for the U.S. Population: National Health Interview Survey, 2011</u></a>,&quot; December 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-june-2013/\"><u>Kaiser Health Tracking Poll: June 2013</u></a>,&quot; June 19, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W.
