This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we called O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s office to ask for his source, Catholics for Choice directed us to its <a href=\"http://www.brspoll.com/uploads/files/Catholics%20for%20Choice%20survey.pdf\">2009 survey</a> of 923 Catholics who were registered voters, a study conducted by Belden Russonello &amp; Stewart.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly 14 percent said abortion should be illegal in all instances. Another 37 percent said it should be legal in just a few cases, 27 percent said it should be legal in most cases and 21 percent said it should be legal in all cases. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the 356 who said they attended Mass frequently, 31 percent said abortion should never be legal. The rate was 6 percent among the 426 who occasionally attend Mass and 3 percent among the 138 who said they never attend.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe came across <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseId=268&amp;ss=print\">a 2004 Quinnipiac University poll</a> which found that 17 percent of Catholics said abortion should be illegal in all cases while 16 percent said it should be legal in all cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tQuinnipiac <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1298\">asked the same questions in 2009</a> and found little change among Catholics; 16 percent wanted abortion to be illegal in all instances while 13 percent said it should be legal in all cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Pew Research Center has also looked at the question. Its director of survey research, Scott Keeter, sent us the latest survey, of 2,410 adults -- including 532 Catholics -- conducted from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4, 2011. While 16 percent of all respondents said abortion should be illegal in all cases (with a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points), 19 percent of Catholics (with a margin of error of 5 points) felt the same way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the Knights of Columbus released their own survey, done by Maris in December 2011, in which 14 percent of Catholics said abortion should always be illegal. The same percentage &nbsp;said abortion should be available at any time during a pregnancy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, in all the surveys we saw, Catholics split along the same lines as non-Catholics and devout Catholics were more likely to agree with the Vatican stance on the legality of abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s the summary:</p>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<table style=\"border:none;border-collapse:collapse\">\r\n\t\t<colgroup>\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"112\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"104\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"104\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"104\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"103\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"97\" />\r\n\t\t</colgroup>\r\n\t\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t\t<tr style=\"height:0px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCatholics say abortion should be . . .</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tQuinnipiac 2004</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tQuinnipiac 2009</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCatholics for Choice 2009</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPew 2011</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKnights of Columbus 2011</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr style=\"height:0px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlways illegal</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t17%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t19%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14%</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr style=\"height:0px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMostly illegal</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t31%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t28%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t37%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t26%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tN.A.</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr style=\"height:0px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMostly legal</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t30%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t37%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t27%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t33%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tN.A.</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr style=\"height:0px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlways legal</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t16%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t13%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t21%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t18%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t14%</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t</tbody>\r\n\t</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJon O&#39;Brien of Catholics for Choice said that &quot;only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican&#39;s position that abortion should be illegal.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo polls, one commissioned by his organization and one commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, support that precise number.
