If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And the man who could be our next president was rooting for it to happen,&quot; the ad contends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peters&rsquo; statement that Trump &quot;rooted for the housing crisis,&quot; clearly draws on the Clinton ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His office referred us to the Democratic National Committee, which supplied the Clinton ad with Trump&rsquo;s &quot;I sort of hope that happens&quot; audio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our national PolitiFact team checked the original claim made in May by the Clinton ad and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-faults-donald-trump-hoping-real-es/\">rated it Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&quot;I sort of hope that happens&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s statement comes from the audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/mar/08/secret-behind-trump-universitys-rating-doing-nothi/\">Trump University</a>, which has been the subject of three lawsuits from former &quot;students&quot; who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, real estate values had peaked and there was concern that they were overpriced, creating a &quot;bubble&quot; that could burst, producing a rapid fall in values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, &quot;There&#39;s a lot of talk, which you&#39;ve no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What&#39;s your take on that pessimism?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you&#39;re in a good cash position &mdash; which I&#39;m in a good cash position today &mdash; then people like me would go in and buy like crazy,&quot; he says in a portion of the audiobook <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/politics/donald-trump-2006-hopes-real-estate-market-crashes/index.html\">posted by CNN</a>. &quot;If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the &quot;bubble burst&quot; that Trump was hoping for deserves to be called a &quot;crash,&quot; especially a crash on the scale of what occurred during the Great Recession, is open to debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, in the audiobook, adds: &quot;At the same time, I don&#39;t think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. I&#39;m not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, he would turn out to be wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year later, in 2007, Trump was<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/trump-touts-soft-markets-in-cities-like-toronto/article17993211/\"> telling the Toronto Globe and Mail</a> that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I&#39;m excited if it is,&quot; he told the paper. &quot;I&#39;ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign didn&#39;t respond to PolitiFact&#39;s&nbsp;emails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Scott Peters, D-CA, said Donald Trump &quot;rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His statement parallels a claim in Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s May campaign ad: &quot;In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said on more than one occasion that he welcomed a downturn in the real estate market because it would give him a chance to buy properties at a bargain and sell them at a higher price later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s far less clear is whether Trump was rooting for something on the scale of the Great Recession, a suggestion made in the Clinton ad, or a &quot;housing crisis,&quot; as suggested by Peters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Trump&rsquo;s comments in his audiobook and to the Globe and Mail show he didn&#39;t envision the financial meltdown that followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact rated Clinton&rsquo;s statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-faults-donald-trump-hoping-real-es/\">Mostly True</a>, saying it was &quot;accurate but needs clarification or additional information.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the same reason, we rate Peters&rsquo; statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;<u>more</u>&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20b849c5-4175-4117-a150-6010ffdaec89\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20b849c5-4175-4117-a150-6010ffdaec89</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-19T16:50:37.095519", "ruling_date": "2016-07-20T03:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Congressman repeats Mostly True claim: Donald Trump \u2018rooted for the housing crisis\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "ca-congressman-repeats-mostly-true-critique-donald", "ruling_link_text": "Trump said he hoped for bubble, but not a 'housing crisis'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Rep.
