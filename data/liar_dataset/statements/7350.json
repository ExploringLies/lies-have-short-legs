Marcia Fudge, weighed in on that question by delivering <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-01-14/pdf/CREC-2013-01-14-pt1-PgH76-4.pdf#page=3\">a series of speeches</a> on the House of Representatives floor that decried a U.S. &quot;culture of violence.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNewly elected Columbus Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty used the opportunity to deliver her first oration on the House of Representatives floor. In it, she lamented that &quot;mass killings have gone from being an extremely rare occurrence to a common occurrence,&quot; and suggested the U.S re-examine its funding for mental health services, place adequate controls on ammunition and &nbsp;&quot;ensure proper and tighter access to firearms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;According to Harvard Health Policy Review, each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire, and about 80,000 people are wounded,&quot; the former Ohio state legislator noted, applauding President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for &quot;proactively taking the necessary steps to address this critical issue.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered whether Beatty&rsquo;s statistics were accurate, so we decided to track them down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe soon found an article in the Fall 2001 issue of Harvard Health Policy Review, titled <a href=\"http://hhpronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HHPR_Fall_2001.pdf\">The Costs and Benefits of Reducing Gun Violence</a>, that begins with the exact wording used by Beatty - &quot;Each year, approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire and about 80,000 are wounded.&quot; But the date of that article gave us pause. The numbers it cited were more than a decade old. We wanted to find more recent numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm\">statistics</a> to verify the information. The latest available version of its data says there were 31,672 firearms deaths in the United States during 2010, a ratio of 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people. That number &nbsp;is a bit higher than the number Harvard Health Policy Review cited in 2001, although it is certainly in the ballpark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe<a href=\"http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/nfirates2001.html\"> second set of CDC data</a> we examined tracks non-fatal gun injuries. By the CDC&rsquo;s reckoning, there were 73,883 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2011, a rate of 23.7 injuries per 100,000 people. That number is a bit lower than the number Beatty cited from the Harvard Health Policy Review, although it isn&rsquo;t too far off. If the number of non fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns were added into the mix, the number of injuries from 2011 would exceed Harvard&rsquo;s estimate of 80,000 yearly wounds from gunfire. According to CDC, 16,451 people in the United States were hurt by pellet guns - about 5.3 incidents per 100,000 people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeatty accurately represented the statistics printed in Harvard Health Policy Review, even though its tally was more than a decade old. More recent data indicates those numbers haven&rsquo;t changed much over the years. We rate her statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-07T18:12:21.443041", "ruling_date": "2013-02-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
