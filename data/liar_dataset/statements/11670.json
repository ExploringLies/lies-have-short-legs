A Democrat has been in the White House since 2009 and Democrats have controlled the U.S. Senate for most of the time since then. Of course, House Republicans such as Ryan have played a key role in the federal budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s see what the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/american-action-network/\">American Action Network</a> is talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The network&rsquo;s ad</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington, D.C.-based group, founded in 2010 by former Republican U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, <a href=\"https://americanactionnetwork.org/about\">says</a> it promotes &quot;center-right solutions to our nation&rsquo;s challenges.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a so-called <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000060058\">dark-money</a> nonprofit in that it is not required to disclose the names of its donors. The group <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/101409589.html\">ran ads</a> against Democrat <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/russ-feingold/\">Russ Feingold</a> in 2010, who lost his U.S. Senate seat later that year to Republican <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ron-johnson/\">Ron Johnson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo; <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/Ad-Conservative-AAN_SC_Ryan+(1).pdf\">half-page ad</a> ran in the Journal Sentinel on Dec. 7 and 8, 2015 and is <a href=\"https://americanactionnetwork.org/press/aan-launches-3-million-campaign-conservative-solutions-new-leadership\">said to be</a> part of a $3 million national campaign. The attention-getting photo at the top of the ad shows 26 older white people and carried this headline: &quot;What&rsquo;s the top priority of the new leadership in Congress? Fighting for the conservative principles that keep America strong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad also featured a picture of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/\">Ryan</a> and urged readers to thank the newly installed speaker of the House for &quot;making America stronger.&quot; It said the Janesville Republican is working with conservatives in Congress to &quot;rein in runaway spending,&quot; then made this claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent &ndash; nearly $800 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Network&rsquo;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a reminder, the federal deficit is the difference in a given year between the government&rsquo;s receipts and its expenditures. That&rsquo;s different from the debt, an accumulation of deficits that is approaching $19 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back its claim, the American Action Network compared the deficit in 2010 to 2015, citing figures from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll note that the federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30.

But his claim was more general, whereas the network specifically credited conservatives for deficit reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That not only is problematic in that Republicans had relatively little power compared to Democrats, but because the overall economy has a much bigger impact on deficits than governmental actions such as spending cuts do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/about/staff/steve-ellis\">Steve Ellis</a>, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us Republicans deserve credit for trimming increases in spending that would have been in place had Democrats maintained control of the House. At the same time, the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/22/politifact-guide-sequestration/\">Budget Control Act</a> of 2011 was also approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate and by Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-deficit-has-decreased-two-thir/\">Experts also say</a> the deficit has come down in recent years at least as much because of the improving economy, which drives tax revenues up and lessens spending on programs such as food stamps and Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economist <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu//~auerbach/\">Alan Auerbach</a>, director of a <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~burch/\">tax policy and public finance center at the </a>University of California, Berkeley, told us the higher revenues -- especially from individual and corporate income taxes -- had a much bigger impact on deficits than any changes made by the Congress or the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama, of course, and perhaps to a lesser extent GOP leaders in Congress, could claim some, but not all, of the credit for the improved economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Action Network said: &quot;Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent &ndash; nearly $800 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deficit reduction is actually somewhat larger for the period cited by the network, 2010 to 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for most of that period, Republicans controlled only the House.
