Last year, Sentier initiated a new statistic based on U.S. Census Bureau data -- a &quot;household income index&quot; that tracks upticks and downticks in median income and reports it monthly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.sentierresearch.com/reports/Sentier_Household_Income_Trends_Report_July2012_09_10_12.pdf\">What did Sentier find?</a> In January 2009, the month Obama took office, median household income was $54,893. In June 2012, it was $50,881, a drop of almost $4,000. (We used inflation-adjusted figures from a spreadsheet provided to us by Sentier. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> cited slightly different figures, but the difference is just a few dollars.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo create Sentier&rsquo;s index, principals Gordon Green and John Coder take data from the</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBureau&rsquo;s monthly household survey, the one used to determine the national unemployment rate. This census survey reaches approximately 50,000 households and 130,000 household members each month, asking a variety of questions, including the sum of income earned by household members during the previous 12 months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s very similar to how the census produces its report called the Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. That survey also asks households about income, but over a given calendar year. The census&rsquo; Current Population Survey was just released for 2011. The median income: $50,054.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreen told us the comparable figure in his work is Sentier&rsquo;s January 2012 index because it asked respondents about their income for the previous 12 months. In that case, those months are calendar year 2011. Sentier&rsquo;s median income for that period: $50,020, a difference of just $34. That would indicate that Sentier&#39;s methodology produces a number very close to the official census number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSentier&rsquo;s index is a new measuring stick, and not time-tested, but Green and Coder are both retired from the census, and their work has been widely cited in the media.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Census Bureau is the source of official statistics,&quot; Green said. &quot;What we do is fill it in with the monthly data.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Other factors</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis brings us to the dicey issue of blaming Obama for the trend, whatever it is. At PolitiFact, we don&rsquo;t only assess the accuracy of statistics cited in political claims, but whether it&rsquo;s valid to say a certain politician is responsible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, for his take.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There is always a problem in attributing outcomes to presidents based on their terms, since there are a large number of erratic factors over which they have no control. This is especially the case with President Obama, who inherited an economy that was falling off a cliff,&quot; Baker said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added that a better question is what Romney or anyone else would have done that would have produced better results.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Romney seems to be saying that a big tax cut would have done the trick with little or no money to help the states or for any of the other spending components of the stimulus. That doesn&#39;t seem very plausible to me, but that is the question that we should be asking,&quot; Baker said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlus, a look back at incomes over several years shows that incomes track the state of the overall economy. <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2011/H06AR_2011.xls\">According to the census</a>, the median income hit an all-time high in 1999 (when you adjust for inflation), reaching $54,932. It decreased each year through 2004, hitting $52,788. It then climbed again until 2007 -- the beginning of the recession -- to $54,489, and has been on the way down since then. Sentier&rsquo;s research also reflects steady increases with small dips and peaks over the past decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDan Mitchell, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute, had this to say about the blame factor:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That drop started before Obama took office, so I don&#39;t think he deserves full blame for everything after Jan. 20, 2009,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;But this has been a very weak recovery, so clearly he should be held responsible for some of the bad news.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s ad says that &quot;under Obama families have lost over $4,000 a year in income.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat figure comes from a new but well-respected index created by Sentier Research, which tracked a decline in the median family income from the month Obama took office through June 2012. It&rsquo;s tricky to compare that data with census data because they represent different time periods. But where it is possible to compare Sentier with the census, the results are within a few dollars of each other.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the ad&rsquo;s claim runs into trouble by overtly blaming Obama. The economy was on a downward track before he took office, and a president has limited control over those forces. To the extent he should be held responsible, Mitchell told us, the slow recovery has all been on his watch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s ad cites trustworthy figures but oversimplifies the issue by assigning blame to Obama.
