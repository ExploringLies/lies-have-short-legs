He faces Clackamas County Commission chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county commissioner Paul Savas and state Rep. Dave Hunt in Tuesday&rsquo;s election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSnubbing PERS is a nice symbolic pledge for someone running on a platform of limited government. It also won&rsquo;t hurt Ludlow, who is 63 years old, as much as it would someone who is further away from retirement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the next part of Ludlow&rsquo;s claim really caught our attention. In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=356121514414823&amp;story_fbid=417413881618919\">a Facebook post</a> dated March 30, he wrote, &quot;I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $30,000 per year that would have been paid on my behalf.&quot; (The post was changed Tuesday; we&rsquo;ll explain below.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat sounded like a lot of money saved, given that a county commissioner&rsquo;s annual salary is $81,000. We checked it out. In doing so, Ludlow clarified to PolitiFact Oregon and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Ludlow-For-Clackamas-County-Chair/356121514414823\">on Facebook </a>that by declining PERS, &quot;the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Ludlow why he had claimed $30,000 in savings a year, and now $68,000 over four years. He said it&rsquo;s hard getting solid numbers from the Public Employees Retirement System. &quot;I am now satisfied that the last numbers quoted by me are the correct numbers,&quot; he wrote us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHmmm. We don&rsquo;t think politicians, aspiring or otherwise, should claim savings without evidence. That&rsquo;s careless.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s get back to how much county taxpayers will save should Ludlow decline retirement benefits. The county position pays $80,868 a year<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is how public retirement payments work: Every employer pays a &quot;contribution rate,&quot; depending on the type of employer and type of employee. The rates are set in advance. In the case of Clackamas County, the <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/PERS/section/general_information/contribution_rates_11-13.pdf\">employer contribution rate is 11.99 percent for general service workers for the 2011-13 budget period</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 11.99 percent includes 6.13 percent that the employer puts in for a member&rsquo;s retirement, plus 5.86 percent to cover the system&rsquo;s &quot;unfunded actuarial liability,&quot; or the money needed to pay for current and future retirees. In addition, the county pays -- or &quot;picks up&quot; -- the 6 percent the employee is required to contribute on his or her behalf.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat adds up to $14,500 a year. But David Crosley, a spokesman for PERS, said the actual amount of money saved -- or avoided -- should Ludlow decline is closer to $9,800 a year, or a little more than $39,000 over four years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s because the county needs to kick in for unfunded actuarial liability anyway, regardless of whether Ludlow declines PERS for himself. &quot;That amount gets spread over fewer people,&quot; Crosley said. &quot;They&rsquo;re not saving that in the long term.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s look at this from the county&rsquo;s perspective, which is what Ludlow relies on. Marc Gonzales, the county&rsquo;s finance director, confirmed the county budgets about $17,247 a year per commissioner for retirement-related costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy is it higher? In part, because the county calculates the figure with longer-term employees in mind, and they have higher retirement costs. Tim Heider, a spokesman for Clackamas County, wrote in an email that &quot;the county would not incur any PERS cost for an employee who declines enrollment.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we&rsquo;ve gone from $30,000 a year to roughly $17,000 a year to $9,800 a year. It&rsquo;s undeniable that Ludlow will save taxpayers money by declining to join PERS, should he win. But he&rsquo;s off on how much, and whether it would have been paid on his behalf.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s certainly not the $30,000 a year he originally claimed. It may be $17,000 as he now claims, but that&rsquo;s because the county has budgeted generously. (Ludlow as a new member will not cost taxpayers as much as employees who have been in the system for a long time.) The Public Employees Retirement System estimates money that would have gone to him is closer to $10,000 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLudlow&rsquo;s revised statement is partially true but missing information.
