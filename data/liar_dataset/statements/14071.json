Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would switch parties unless the GOP stops supporting President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headlines are wrong, even though the stories use real quotes from Graham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Lindsey Graham threatens to convert to Democrat if Republicans don&rsquo;t Dump Trump,&quot; read the headline from a <a href=\"http://truetrumpers.com/lindsey-graham-threatens-to-convert-to-democrat-if-republicans-dont-dump-trump\">March 21, 2017, post from TrueTrumpers.com</a>. Facebook users reported the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to crack down on fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline is certainly made up, because there&rsquo;s no evidence Graham has considered trading in his elephant for a donkey. The story, meanwhile, does use real quotes in which Graham disagreed with Trump &mdash; albeit before the real estate billionaire was president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can tell this is an old article, because TrueTrumpers.com&rsquo;s post called Trump the &quot;the Republican Party&rsquo;s presumptive nominee.&quot; The bulk of the story concerns Trump&rsquo;s attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump had said in June 2016 that Curiel had &quot;an absolute conflict&quot; because of his &quot;Mexican heritage,&quot; saying <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442\">Curiel was biased against Trump</a> over his calls to build a wall on the border with Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curiel <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/07/481140881/who-is-judge-gonzalo-curiel-the-man-trump-attacked-for-his-mexican-ancestry\">shrugged off the comments</a>, and approved a <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2017-03-31/judge-appears-close-to-approving-trump-university-settlement\">$25 million settlement</a> in the case. The judge has recently been assigned a case brought by a <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-04-20/gonzalo-curiel-judge-trump-criticized-over-mexican-heritage-to-preside-over-daca-deportation-case\">young man deported in February 2017</a>, despite being protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TrueTrumpers.com post said Graham told the <em>New York Times</em> that Trump&rsquo;s comments were &quot;the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy. If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graham did say this, in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/us/politics/democrats-trump-presidential-race.html?_r=0\">June 6, 2016 story</a> in the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also uses another real quote from Graham, who told NBC News&rsquo; Hallie Jackson <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/tamron-hall/watch/sen-graham-refuses-to-support-trump-700685379783\">the following day</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me. But there&rsquo;ll come a point in time where we&rsquo;re gonna have to understand that it&rsquo;s not just about the 2016 race, it&rsquo;s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also quotes from Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine (although the post referred to Collins as a representative instead of a senator).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TrueTrumpers.com story <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-donald-trump_us_575700fee4b0ca5c7b5038c2\">largely copied a June 7, 2016, article</a> on the Huffington Post, and has appeared on other websites prior to this March 21 post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://wearechange.org/lindsey-graham-will-become-democrat-republicans-elect-trump/\">June 9 post on WeAreChange.org</a> had the same story, but with a slightly different headline that read, &quot;Lindsey Graham will become a Democrat if Republicans select Trump,&quot; reflecting that Trump had not yet been officially nominated. The first couple of paragraphs were altered from the Huffington Post article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By <a href=\"http://spinzon.com/lindsey-graham-threatens-convert-democrat-republicans-dont-dump-trump/\">March 20, 2017, a post on Spinzon.com</a> had the same headline as the TrueTrumpers.com post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s apparent that a radical headline was slapped on the story to drive traffic. Graham did not say he was planning on changing his party affiliation, but he did disagree with Trump&rsquo;s comments about a federal judge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the story itself is accurate (albeit with little context), the headline is not. We rate it False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-02T16:39:14.617327", "ruling_date": "2017-05-02T17:00:36", "ruling_headline": "Persistent post incorrectly says Lindsey Graham to become Democrat over Trump", "ruling_headline_slug": "persistent-post-incorrectly-says-gops-graham-becom", "ruling_link_text": "A made-up headline on an out-of-context story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>TrueTrumpers.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://truetrumpers.com/lindsey-graham-threatens-to-convert-to-democrat-if-republicans-dont-dump-trump\">Lindsey Graham threatens to convert to Democrat if Republicans don&rsquo;t Dump Trump</a>,&quot; March 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-keeps-up-attacks-on-judge-gonzalo-curiel-1464911442\">Trump Says Judge&rsquo;s Mexican Heritage Presents &lsquo;Absolute Conflict&rsquo;</a>,&quot; June 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/us/politics/democrats-trump-presidential-race.html?_r=0\">Democrats Jump on Allies of Donald Trump in Judge Dispute</a>,&quot; June 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/07/481140881/who-is-judge-gonzalo-curiel-the-man-trump-attacked-for-his-mexican-ancestry\">Who Is Judge Gonzalo Curiel, The Man Trump Attacked For His Mexican Ancestry?</a>,&quot; June 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/tamron-hall/watch/sen-graham-refuses-to-support-trump-700685379783\">Sen.
