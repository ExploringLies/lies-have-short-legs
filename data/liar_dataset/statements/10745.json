But amid their calls for voters to hold presidential candidates accountable for the country&rsquo;s finances, a few nuggets stood out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both at an appearance at the Rudman Center at the University of New Hampshire School of Law and at an editorial board meeting at the <em>Monitor</em>, Bayh talked about a specific challenge of reining in military spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fastest-growing part of the Pentagon&rsquo;s budget are health care expenses,&quot; said Bayh, a former Senate Armed Services committee member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s growing faster than spending on tanks and planes and salaries? Could this be true? We decided to look into the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://csbaonline.org/about/people/tharrison/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Todd Harrison</u></a>, a senior fellow in defense budget studies at the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Bayh is on the mark. While Bayh&rsquo;s statement is broad, and one can divide the defense budget into different wedges, health care spending has soared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Among the main areas of the defense budget (like procurement, R&amp;D, construction, pay, etc.) military healthcare has grown the fastest,&quot; Harrison wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44993\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>has found the same trend</u></a>. According to a report it released last year: &quot;The cost of providing health care to service members, retirees, and their families increased by 130 percent&quot; from 2000 to 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what are the specific numbers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For fiscal year 2016, Harrison said, the military&rsquo;s projected health care costs are expected to total $48 billion dollars. That sum covers the 9.2 million beneficiaries of Tricare, the Pentagon&rsquo;s benefits program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of that money doesn&rsquo;t help out frontline troops, either. It pays for benefits to their dependents, or to retirees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CBO report found total spending of <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44993\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$52 billion</u></a> in 2012, which is lower than the 2016 projection. But Harrison said any decline is illusory. The Defense Department has included reforms to health care system in its budget request, but Congress &quot;will likely deny many if not all of the reforms,&quot; he said. The actual cost would then be higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Harrison wrote, military health care costs have &quot;grown from being just 4 percent of the DoD budget in 1990 to 10 percent today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If anything, this undercounts the actual fiscal impact. The Tricare system of military health care coverage is an entirely separate entity from veterans&rsquo; health care, which is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo; budget. And VA coverage isn&rsquo;t cheap: It&rsquo;s likely to cost $62 billion in fiscal year 2016, Harrison said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the standards of health insurance, Tricare coverage is generous. According to <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2014/12/19/military-health-program-tricare/20654019/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reporting by the </u><u>Military Times</u></a>, &quot;active-duty family members . . . pay no annual enrollment fees and no cost-shares to see a physician. Retirees pay $555.84 a year to enroll themselves and their families in Tricare Prime and pay fees ranging from $12 to 20 percent of a bill depending on the care received.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The addition of retirees and their families under the so-called <a href=\"http://www.tricare.mil/tfl\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Tricare for Life </u></a>program has been a major driver of the increased costs, the <em>Military Times </em>wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, former defense secretary Chuck Hagel warned that the health care expenses were hurting the military&rsquo;s overall mission. The Pentagon&rsquo;s greatest fiscal challenge, <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-struggles-high-cost-health-care-075320388--politics.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>he said in 2013</u></a>, was &quot;the growing imbalance in where that money is being spent internally.&quot; That is, toward doctors&rsquo; bills, not boots on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competition for the fastest-growing part of the budget is spending to fight terrorism and extremism (called <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/24/AR2009032402818.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>overseas contingency operations</u></a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/about/staff/steve-ellis\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Steve Ellis</u></a>, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said resources devoted to those operations spiked far higher on a percentage basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that depends on how one slices the Pentagon budget and the time frame used to measure growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/defbudget/fy2016/fy2016_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Defense Department&rsquo;s 2016 budget request</u></a>, overseas contingency operation spending was $22.9 billion in fiscal year 2001, and peaked at $186.9 billion in fiscal year 2008. It&rsquo;s projected to come back down to $50.9 billion for 2016. In other words, while that spending increased a staggering amount, it has dropped markedly in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their <a href=\"http://law.unh.edu/events/2015/04/debt-matters-with-senators-bayh-and-gregg-luncheon\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New Hampshire appearances</u></a>, Bayh and Gregg said military spending is not the main driver of the United States&rsquo; debt and deficits. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid pose the biggest long-term challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discretionary spending -- which includes spending on the military -- &quot;is not our problem,&quot; Gregg said at the Rudman Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bayh said that &quot;the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon&rsquo;s budget are health care expenses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s little debate that generous military health care benefits are taking up an ever-increasing share of the Pentagon&rsquo;s budget. While other parts of the budget have spiked, that&rsquo;s in the past.
