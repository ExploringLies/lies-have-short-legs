But, the story said, only one unemployed electrician was needed to install the lights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, while the ad leaves the impression these are ordinary light bulbs, that&rsquo;s far from the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs in many other U.S. cities, the Racine money came through the <a href=\"http://www1.eere.energy.gov/wip/eecbg.html\">Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block </a><a href=\"http://www1.eere.energy.gov/wip/eecbg.html\">Grant </a>program. At least 30 cities asked for more than $104 million in federal stimulus funds to help them change to LED (light-emitting diodes), replacing high-pressure sodium lights, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-03-02-streetlights_N.htm\">USA </a><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-03-02-streetlights_N.htm\">Today </a>reported in March 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRacine&rsquo;s total grant was <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/recovery/item/20120201/250937\">$795,000</a>, but not all of it was for the street lights. A good chunk of it -- about $194,000 -- was for energy audits of homes and loans to residents who wanted to save money through weatherization and other energy-saving changes. Another $79,500 was for administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA total of $521,500 was for the new LED lights, with about half for street lights and half for city government buildings, according to Kathleen Fischer, the city&rsquo;s assistant finance director.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the Crossroads ad is off on the $800,000 claim as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe installation did only result in enough work for one full-time electrician, according to Racine Mayor John Dickert.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there are a couple other aspects to this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, Racine is saving 59 percent on energy costs thanks to the lights. That is projected to amount to about $40,000 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It was money well spent,&quot; said Mark Yehlen, commissioner of Public Works. &quot;We have realized significant savings.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, one of the primary suppliers of LED lights for the Racine project was a Racine-area company, Ruud Lighting, that builds the lights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRuud has expanded and added jobs while winning contracts to supply LED lights all over the United States to municipalities -- many of them using the federal stimulus dollars flowing through the Department of Energy&rsquo;s block grant program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;BetaLED, a division of Ruud Lighting, Inc., is seeing a healthy boost in business as cities tap into their Recovery Act funds...&quot;, a Department of Energy <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/wisconsin-led-plant-benefits-recovery-act\">news </a><a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/wisconsin-led-plant-benefits-recovery-act\">release </a>said in April 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Ruud was purchased by Cree Inc. in 2011 and announced job-expansion plans, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker <a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/Default.aspx?Page=ddd35d6c-fda7-4f33-8f26-b589493156ce\">praised the </a><a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/Default.aspx?Page=ddd35d6c-fda7-4f33-8f26-b589493156ce\">company </a>and said Ruud would be eligible for up to $4 million in state tax credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor years, many of the LED conversions involved lights mostly made in Asia, though the lights often were assembled in the United States, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c/\">PolitiFact </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c/\">National </a>and <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/05/stimulus-money-for-jobs-overseas/\">FactCheck.org </a>found in previous fact checks. That was because the Energy Department initially felt insufficient components were available domestically.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRuud has won some contracts because it uses more American-made parts than other companies, according to <a href=\"http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_761986.html\">news </a><a href=\"http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_761986.html\">coverage </a>in Pittsburgh, where it also won work, though not through stimulus funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;These ads are really disappointing,&quot; said Dickert, the Racine mayor. &quot;They are only telling half the story, if that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrossroads GPS charges that Baldwin voted for wasteful spending through a &quot;$1 trillion stimulus&quot; plan, specifically citing &quot;$800,000 to replace light bulbs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn both counts, the numbers are too high. While only one job was created to complete the project, city officials say it will save city taxpayers money every year and a growing local company got a big chunk of the contract to make the lights. They are in the midst of a hiring effort and have won stimulus-funded work all over the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s an element of truth in that federal stimulus money went to buy light bulbs, but overall we rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-22T12:05:54.197241", "ruling_date": "2012-08-23T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Crossroads GPS says Baldwin voted to spend $800,000 to replace light bulbs", "ruling_headline_slug": "crossroads-gps-says-baldwin-voted-spend-800000-rep", "ruling_link_text": "Charge dims under bright light", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCrossroads GPS, campaign <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T1BnVBHweo&amp;feature=plcp\">TV ad</a>, August 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFox6 WITI Milwaukee, <a href=\"http://fox6now.com/2011/11/09/see-how-wisconsin-is-spending-its-share-of-federal-stimulus-funds/\">&quot;See how Wisconsin is spending its share of federal stimulus funds</a>,&quot;
