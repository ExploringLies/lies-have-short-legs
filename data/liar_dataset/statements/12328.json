He started as a machine operator and accountant and eventually became its president, the article said.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>More recent statements also reinforce the idea that Johnson, who bought Pacur in 1997, didn&#39;t start the company alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s official Senate <a href=\"http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/biography\">website says</a> he started the company with Curler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So did <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/RonJohnsonWI/status/712363601793826816\">a tweet </a>Johnson sent in in March 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defending the statement in the press release, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us Johnson &quot;helped build Pacur&nbsp;into a great Wisconsin success story, and we&#39;ve never said anything counter to how it all&nbsp;began.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Announcing a statewide tour in his campaign for reelection, a Johnson news release said Johnson &quot;started&quot; the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim contradicts Pacur&rsquo;s own company history and Johnson&rsquo;s prior statements, which make it clear he helped start Pacur with his brother-in-law, who was more involved in the founding.
