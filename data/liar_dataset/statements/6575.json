The study uses 2011 income data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe top 5 percent alone get 41 percent of the total tax savings associated with these breaks, the study found. The &quot;middle&quot; 60 percent of earners, by contrast, get less than a third of the benefit, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe effect is even more pronounced if just the major itemized deductions are eliminated, but other breaks are kept, Williams said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt makes sense, Williams said. Lower earners have lower tax rates, so they get less benefit from the breaks than wealthier people who have more to deduct and pay higher tax rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They do benefit disproportionately,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDaniel Mitchell, a Cato Institute senior fellow who studies tax reform, said the state and local tax deduction and charitable contributions deduction are &quot;very heavily tilted to the rich.&quot; He added: &quot;The mortgage interest deduction is tilted to the rich as well, but not as dramatically.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note that Romney&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/tax\">tax reform </a><a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/tax\">plan </a>does not call for dumping all tax deductions. He has said that if some deductions were eliminated, overall rates could be lowered. While he&rsquo;s provided some specifics, the fate of many deductions is left unclear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs always in tax matters, there are some nuances here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn sheer numbers, some tax deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction are claimed by far more middle- and lower-income people than by people in the top brackets, IRS data shows. That&rsquo;s in part a reflection of how broad the middle class is compared to the upper-income tiers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax savings from various preferences are spread throughout the population, from tax credits for low-income people to investment tax breaks for the wealthy, Williams noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s campaign cited IRS data showing greater benefits as you rise through the tax brackets, and that&rsquo;s confirmed in the Tax Policy Center analysis, we found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur third expert, William McBride, chief economist for the Tax Foundation, said judging Ryan&rsquo;s statement &quot;depends on the definition of rich.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan gave a clue - people in the &quot;top brackets.&quot; But in 2011 there were six income tax brackets ranging from 10 percent to 35 percent, and drawing the line between the middle class and &quot;wealthy&quot; is a subjective call.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe big benefits for the top fifth of earners, as found by the Tax Policy Center, are in a group whose incomes start at $103,000. Is that &quot;wealthy?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat if, like President Barack Obama, you set $250,000 and up as a benchmark for raising tax rates for the &quot;wealthy?&quot; People in that group got less than 40 percent of the tax savings -- a figure that is somewhat at odds with the &quot;most&quot; description used by Ryan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, our experts said that, overall, it&rsquo;s clear the benefits are tilted heavily to the upper end of the income scale. One more example: Just 0.1 percent of earners alone got 13 percent of the benefits, the Tax Policy Center study found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan, countering criticism of Romney tax plan, said that wealthy taxpayers, not middle-income earners, get &quot;most of the deductions&quot; in the tax code.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s on target, with the caveat that it partly depends on the definition of &quot;wealthy.&quot; Wealthier people pay higher tax rates and tend to get more benefit from deductions than lower-income earners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Mostly True.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-29T16:06:45.409863", "ruling_date": "2012-08-29T16:13:50", "ruling_headline": "Ryan says wealthy taxpayers get most of the deductions in the tax code", "ruling_headline_slug": "ryan-says-wealthy-taxpayers-get-most-deductions-ta", "ruling_link_text": "Advantage, big earners", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFox News, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/28/paul-ryan-readies-for-his-close-up-ahead-republican-national-convention/\">video of Paul Ryan interview</a>, Aug. 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview with Roberton Williams, Tax Policy Center, Aug. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with William McBride, Tax Foundation, Aug. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Daniel Mitchell, Cato Institute, Aug. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Brendan Buck, spokesman, Ryan campaign, Aug. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?template=simulation&amp;SimID=385&amp;relTTN=T11-0322\">Distribution of Tax Expenditures</a>, Table T11-0322, accessed Aug. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIRS, SOI Tax Stats, <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats---Individual-Statistical-Tables-by-Size-of-Adjusted-Gross-Income\">Individual Income Tax Returns 1304</a>, accessed Aug. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 24, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 373, "last_name": "Ryan", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "paul-ryan", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_WX201_HOUSE_2016_PRIMARI.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/373/", "total_count": 89, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.house.gov/ryan/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tWealthy taxpayers, not middle-income earners, get &quot;most of the deductions&quot; in the tax code.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2012-08-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 258, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/258/", "subject": "Wealth", "subject_slug": "wealth", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/14/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
