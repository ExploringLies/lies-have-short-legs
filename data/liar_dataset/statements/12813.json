Trump has, however, <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/job-creating-mike-pence-vs.-job-crushing-tim-kaine\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>posted</u></a> source materials on his campaign website that takes aim at Kaine&rsquo;s fiscal record as governor from 2006 to 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The $4 billion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six days after taking office in January 2006, Kaine proposed an unsuccessful measure to raise $1 billion a year to deal with long-standing transportation woes. Trump&rsquo;s campaign points to a next-day article in The Washington Post that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/20/AR2006012000884.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> the plan would generate close to $4 billion by the time Kaine&rsquo;s term ended in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine wanted to raise taxes on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not all of Kaine&rsquo;s plan relied on raising broad taxes. About 15 percent of the revenue, or <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?061+oth+HB527F122+PDF\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$150 million a year</u></a>, would have come from assessing steep new fines on people who have chronically bad driving records. It&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch to call those fines a tax, because those payments easily could have been avoided by following traffic laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxing low incomes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the tax and fee increases Kaine proposed in 2006 would have affected all Virginia car owners, including those earning as little as $17,000 or even less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oddly, Trump may have had something entirely different in mind when he cited the $17,000. His campaign website uses that income threshold in referring to a proposal Kaine made at the end of his governorship, not the beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine proposed another ill-fated tax increase in December 2009, his last full month as governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Virginia&rsquo;s economy was reeling from the shocks of the Great Recession. Kaine proposed raising state income tax rates for all brackets by 1 percentage point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed tax increase - defeated in the first week after Kaine left office in 2010 - would have raised about $1.9 billion. That would have been offset by $650 million taxpayers would have saved by a Kaine proposal to eliminate Virginia&rsquo;s personal property tax on vehicles. So the net effect of Kaine&rsquo;s last-year plan would have been a $1.25 billion annual tax hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia, in 2012, looked into a claim that Kaine, during his last year, tried to raise taxes on people &quot;earning as little as $17,000.&quot; It was made by Republican George Allen, whom Kaine defeated that year in a U.S. Senate race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We concluded that many, but not all, households with taxable incomes of $17,000 would have paid more taxes under Kaine&rsquo;s proposal. But in some cases, if a person had a pretty good vehicle, his savings on the car tax repeal would have outweighed his increased income tax bill under Kaine&rsquo;s plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine&rsquo;s 2009 proposal actually would have affected Virginians with less than a $17,000 taxable income. At the time, Virginia required all individuals with taxable incomes of more than $11,950 to file state income taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, we should note, altered his tax criticism of Kaine after he left Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First thing Tim Kaine did was have a $4 billion tax increase,&quot; he said Wednesday during a news conference at the Trump National Doral resort in Florida. In this instance, Trump didn&rsquo;t link Kaine&rsquo;s 2006 tax-hike proposal to people with low incomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Kaine, during his first week as governor, proposed a &quot;nearly $4 billion tax increase&quot; that would have hit people earning as little as $17,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine, six days after taking office in 2006, did propose a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Trump calls it a &quot;nearly $4 billion tax increase,&quot; citing a figure used in a newspaper article at the time. But the article said that sum would be realized over four years. Trump, in using that high $4 billion figure, omits the clarifying time span.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax package centered on raising levies on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. It would have affected people with taxable incomes of $17,000 or lower - if they had a car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump&rsquo;s statement largely is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/528b42df-6b46-432f-8de0-34061afc6b13\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/528b42df-6b46-432f-8de0-34061afc6b13</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-28T17:04:44.788007", "ruling_date": "2016-07-28T17:00:36", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says Tim Kaine proposed $4 billion tax increase during first week as governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-says-tim-kaine-proposed-4-billion-tax", "ruling_link_text": "That's $4 billion over four years", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments at Roanoke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlWIgK540ks\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>rally</u></a>, July 25, 2016.
