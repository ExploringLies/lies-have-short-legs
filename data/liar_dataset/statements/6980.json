Mitt Romney said that he used &quot;binders full of women&quot; from women&rsquo;s groups to help staff his administration, resulting in a Cabinet and senior staff with &quot;more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe cited a survey from the University at Albany-SUNY.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChatter quickly swirled over whether those &quot;binders&quot; &mdash; full of resumes, you Twitter fiends, as opposed to actual women &mdash; came at Romney&rsquo;s request or were the result of a concerted effort by activists that predated his administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered about the result: Was Romney right that a survey concluded his Cabinet and senior staff &quot;had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> What Romney said</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to Romney at the debate, the study showed he was a leader in getting women on his top staff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As I was serving as governor of my state ... I had the chance to pull together a Cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I went to my staff, and I said, &lsquo;How come all the people for these jobs are all men?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Well, gosh, can&#39;t we find some women that are also qualified?&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet. I went to a number of women&#39;s groups and said, &lsquo;Can you help us find folks,&rsquo; and they brought us whole binders full of women.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> The Albany report</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney took office in January 2003.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.albany.edu/womeningov/publications/winter_2004.pdf\">report he cited</a>, published in 2004, focused on a snapshot of policy leaders by gender in 2003. And indeed, it ranked Massachusetts No. 1 in the nation, up from No. 5 in the previous surveys in 1999 and 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf 20 top policy leaders in the state, half were women, according to self-reported statistics from the administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report ranked states by a &quot;representativeness ratio&quot; &mdash; how closely the proportion of women in appointed leadership positions matched the proportion of women in the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe talked with Judith Saidel, the researcher who directed the University at Albany project, which tracked appointees in state government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe found the wording of Romney&rsquo;s claim in the debate &quot;not entirely precise.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney said the state &quot;had more women,&quot; but it more accurately had the highest percentage of women in senior leadership positions tracked by the study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwenty-one states appointed more women to top positions, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If Gov. Romney had said that Massachusetts ranked No. 1 among the states &hellip; he would have been completely precise and accurate,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, she <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/as-governor-romneys-eagerness-to-hire-women-faded/\">told the <em>New York Times</em></a>, &quot;his record, as we measured it, looks darned good.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> What happened next</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe don&#39;t know if Massachusetts remained at the top for percentage of women in the administration. Because of a loss of grant funding, the survey was not conducted again, so there&rsquo;s no snapshot of Romney&rsquo;s appointments compared with other states for the rest of his term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a group of women in Massachusetts who got Romney and his Democratic opponent for governor to agree to make appointing women a priority collaborated with a Boston university to track his progress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe work by researchers and MassGAP, the Massachusetts Government Appointments Project, isn&rsquo;t comparative with the rest of the country &mdash; but does take Romney&rsquo;s entire term into account.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRather than 20 senior leadership positions, it tracked 135 executive-level positions in the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd like the Albany study, it found admirable parity in Romney&rsquo;s first round of appointments: 42 percent of his first 33 hires to senior-level positions were women.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He does deserve credit for that first wave of appointments,&quot; said Carol Hardy-Fanta, senior scholar for the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at University of Massachusetts at Boston who co-authored <a href=\"http://www.umb.edu/editor_uploads/images/centers_institutes/center_women_politics/CWPPPWomenTalentMassGAP_000.pdf\">the report</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the durability of Romney&rsquo;s early effort was fleeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom 2004 to 2006, two years removed from the spotlight of the campaign, just a quarter of Romney&rsquo;s appointments were women.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUpshot: By the time Romney left office, the percentage of women in those 135 positions was slightly lower than when he arrived, falling from 30 percent to just under 28 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Though he can justifiably take pride that 42 percent of his initial appointments were women, he didn&#39;t really move the needle,&quot; Hardy-Fanta said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign pointed us to comments in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/debate-anecdote-prompts-closer-look-inside-romneys-binder/2012/10/17/f93cee4e-1881-11e2-8bfd-12e2ee90dcf2_story.html\"><em>Washington Post</em></a> from Elizabeth Levine, who chaired the Massachusetts Women&rsquo;s Political Caucus when Romney was elected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe &quot;said this type of fluctuation is the norm,&quot; the<em> Post</em> reported, because &quot;administrations often appoint internal candidates to fill short-term positions near the end of a term and that women have a natural disadvantage in those situations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of new people in the pipeline, it&rsquo;s harder to fill those positions with women,&quot; she told the <em>Post</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHardy-Fanta, who was part of the original MassGAP initiative as co-chair of its team recommending women for appointments in higher education, said the group expected better.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think there was an expectation that once you said this was important &mdash; and this group kind of made them aware that this was important &mdash; that it wouldn&#39;t disappear,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney said a survey by the University at Albany after he staffed his Cabinet and senior staff concluded his Massachusetts administration &quot;had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwenty-one states actually employed more women in senior roles in 2003. Rather, Massachusetts had the best <em>percentage</em> in the country, something that earned the state positive recognition. But that&rsquo;s a small clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, that narrow Albany survey reflected the number of female appointees shortly after Romney took office. A broader study that looked at all of Romney&rsquo;s appointments and the percentage of women before and after his term found that his effort flagged halfway through his administration &mdash; and that the overall percentage of women in executive positions actually dropped.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Romney fairly accurately characterized a survey that ranked his state No. 1.
