Now, Harris is accusing his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, of wanting to take legal steps to remove Trump from the Oval Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In our debate, Dan McCready doubled down on his support for Pelosi&rsquo;s liberal agenda of gun control, disrespecting our flag, and impeaching our President,&quot; Harris tweeted after a televised debate on Oct. 10. The tweet was shared more than 160 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that really what McCready said?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the tape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article219560560.html\">website</a>. Part of the debate is also available on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?452745-1/north-carolina-9th-congressional-district-debate&amp;start=1524\">c-span.org</a>, which also has a partial transcript to make the candidates&rsquo; comments more easily trackable. (C-Span missed the first few minutes of the debate because it was broadcasting other news)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this fact check, PolitiFact is choosing to focus on the most specific claim, that McCready wants to impeach Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you watch the debate, though, you&rsquo;ll see that McCready said he favors &quot;common sense&quot; gun background checks, without elaborating on what that policy might look like. And McCready said he stands for the flag but added that he understands that someone who&rsquo;s faced discrimination may kneel &quot;because he or she doesn&rsquo;t feel heard.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pelosi and McCready</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCready has repeatedly said he won&rsquo;t vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker if Democrats gain control of the House. Harris, for his part, pushed back against McCready&rsquo;s claim that he won&rsquo;t support Pelosi as speaker, arguing that McCready&rsquo;s individual vote for House speaker wouldn&rsquo;t matter in the grand scheme of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a certain naivete, if you will, to think that you&rsquo;ll go to Washington as a Democrat and not support Nancy Pelosi who frankly is spending that $350,000 ... to run negative ads against me,&quot; Harris said. &quot;There&rsquo;s a reason for that. If Mr. McCready is elected, he just represents a number that would move the Democrats toward a majority.&quot; If that happens, &quot;Nancy Pelosi has already done the math. She will become the speaker.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The back-and-forth occurs between the 27- and 30-minute marks of the C-Span video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaker or not, Pelosi herself hasn&rsquo;t committed to impeaching Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans this election season have raised the possibility that Democrats might impeach the president. But, as our friends at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/pelosi-isnt-calling-for-trumps-impeachment/\">FactCheck.org</a>&nbsp;noted in March, Pelosi hasn&rsquo;t called for Trump&rsquo;s impeachment and has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll658.xml\">voted</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll035.xml\">table</a>&nbsp;two attempts at impeachment, effectively stopping them. With the election nearing, Pelosi has maintained her position that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/12/politics/impeachment-trump-poll-pelosi/index.html\">impeachment isn&rsquo;t a priority</a>, but she hasn&rsquo;t ruled it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>McCready in the debate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what about McCready? Did he say in the debate that he&rsquo;d vote to impeach Trump?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just before the 26-minute mark of the C-Span video, a moderator notes that Democrats could gain control of the House in this year&rsquo;s elections. If that happens, some Democrats might try to impeach Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you get elected, would you support that or would you not?&quot; the moderator asks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCready didn&rsquo;t offer a yes or a no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These kinds of decisions are very serious decisions and they&rsquo;re decisions that need to be handled based on the facts and the evidence. As a small business owner, I don&rsquo;t deal in hypotheticals, I deal in the facts,&quot; McCready said. &quot;That is a decision &mdash; or, any decision related to the Constitution &mdash; that I would treat very seriously based on the facts at the time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris didn&rsquo;t press McCready on impeaching Trump and the conversation moved on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consistently noncommittal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Harris tweet says McCready in the debate &quot;doubled down&quot; on his support for impeaching Trump. But PolitiFact could find no evidence of McCready declaring that desire previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, several news articles noted that McCready is noncommittal about the prospect of impeachment, specifically. And he&rsquo;s been criticized for being &quot;too vague.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article217265125.html\">Charlotte Observer</a>&nbsp;quoted him saying the same phrase, &quot;I don&rsquo;t deal in hypotheticals,&quot; that he used in the debate. Also in August, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/us/politics/trump-impeachment-democrats-north-carolina.html\">New York Times wrote</a>&nbsp;that McCready &quot;has shown little appetite to talk about impeachment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Times story noted, however, that California billionaire Tom Steyer, &quot;who has led a national pro-impeachment effort all year, has pledged $500,000 to aid&quot; McCready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris tweeted that in his Oct. 10 debate with McCready, McCready &quot;doubled down on his support for Pelosi&rsquo;s liberal agenda of ... impeaching our President.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCready has consistently distanced himself from Pelosi. Regardless, neither Pelosi nor McCready has committed to impeaching Trump. By not opposing impeachment, they&rsquo;ve left the door open to the idea. But that&rsquo;s not the same as publicly stating it&rsquo;s part of the Democratic or McCready agenda. We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-31T15:42:08.786242", "ruling_date": "2018-10-31T11:54:27", "ruling_headline": "Dan McCready hasn't said he'd impeach Trump", "ruling_headline_slug": "dan-mccready-hasnt-said-hed-impeach-trump", "ruling_link_text": "He's been consistently noncommittal", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkHarrisNC9/status/1050181542553772032\">tweet</a>&nbsp;by @MarkHarrisNC9, Mark Harris&#39; Twitter account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?452745-1/north-carolina-9th-congressional-district-debate&amp;start=1524\">C-Span video</a> of the Oct. 10, 2018 debate between North Carolina 9th Congressional District candidates Dan McCready and Mark Harris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video and story by the Charlotte Observer, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article219560560.html\">Harris, McCready debate in closely watched House race</a>,&quot; published on Oct. 7 and updated on Oct. 10, 2018.
