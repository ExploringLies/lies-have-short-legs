Here&rsquo;s the full text relevant to this fact-check:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;Bloomberg puts Trump&rsquo;s current net worth at $2.9 billion, <em>Forbes</em> at $4.1 billion. The <em>National Journal</em> has worked out that if Trump had just put his father&rsquo;s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&amp;P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he&rsquo;d have $8 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you read the <em>National Journal</em> story, it doesn&rsquo;t directly tie whatever money Trump got from his father to an eventual $8 billion today. Here&rsquo;s the key paragraph from a Sept. 2, 2015, article headlined &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/09/02/1-easy-way-donald-trump-could-have-been-even-richer-doing-nothing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The 1 Easy Way Donald Trump Could Have Been Even Richer: Doing Nothing</u></a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;Had the celebrity busi&shy;ness&shy;man and Re&shy;pub&shy;lic&shy;an pres&shy;id&shy;en&shy;tial can&shy;did&shy;ate in&shy;ves&shy;ted his even&shy;tu&shy;al share of his fath&shy;er&rsquo;s real-es&shy;tate com&shy;pany in&shy;to a mu&shy;tu&shy;al fund of S&amp;P 500 stocks in 1974, it would be worth nearly $3 bil&shy;lion today, thanks to the mar&shy;ket&rsquo;s per&shy;form&shy;ance over the past four dec&shy;ades. If he&rsquo;d in&shy;ves&shy;ted the $200 mil&shy;lion that <em>For&shy;bes </em>magazine de&shy;term&shy;ined he was worth in 1982 in&shy;to that in&shy;dex fund, it would have grown to more than $8 bil&shy;lion today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of informed guesswork behind these numbers because outsiders can only know so much about Trump&rsquo;s finances. The<em> National Journal</em> writer, S.V.&nbsp;D&aacute;te, figured Trump started with $40 million in 1974. That&rsquo;s the year he became president of his father&rsquo;s real estate company. By one estimate, the firm was worth about $200 million and divided among Donald Trump and his four siblings, each would have received $40 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not as though the company was liquidated that year. Trump&rsquo;s father lived until 1999, so whatever happened, it&rsquo;s more complicated than Trump receiving a cash inheritance in 1974 and deciding what he would do with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re left with a question of how much money Trump got from his father and, most important, at what point those assets morphed from being his father&rsquo;s to being his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1982, after running his father&rsquo;s firm for eight years,<em> Forbes</em> magazine estimated Trump&rsquo;s worth at $200 million. Since he was in charge of the company, then those dollars are more his than his father&rsquo;s. The <em>Journal</em> article tiptoed around this uncertainty with careful phrasing. The author talked about Trump investing &quot;his eventual share of his father&rsquo;s real estate company.&quot; An eventual share is not cash in hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the article did not say that the estimated $200 million in 1982 was from Trump&rsquo;s father. D&aacute;te&nbsp;told us in his view, that truly was Trump&#39;s money because the real estate company was worth more than that.&nbsp;D&aacute;te said&nbsp;he didn&#39;t really care what the status of the assets was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I just wanted to get to the point of saying that given the amount of money he started with, to be a billionaire &mdash;&nbsp;it&#39;s not too hard,&quot; D&aacute;te&nbsp;said. &quot;I worded it as carefully as I did because there are a lot of uncertainties.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, if the $200 million did not come from Trump&#39;s father, then you can&#39;t say that the father&#39;s money could have been worth $8 billion today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Occupy Democrats&rsquo; Facebook post took a paraphrase of the <em>National Journal</em> piece and then edited the paraphrase down to the text on the image. Occupy Democrats editor Omar Rivero didn&rsquo;t defend the graphic he shared. Rivero said his group occasionally shares graphics made by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you can see in the post description and in the watermark, this graphic was made by Santa Pegatina, a political graphics maker,&quot; Rivero said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best summary of the <em>National Journal</em> article is that it presents a hypothetical investment scenario using numbers that have some basis in the value of the Trump holdings, but aren&rsquo;t necessarily what Trump got directly from his father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Running the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if the underlying assumptions are dodgy, the math at least is in the ballpark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used $40 million as the starting point for 1974. Honghui Chen, associate professor of finance at the University of Central Florida, told us the account would have grown to $3.94 billion by November 2015 if the money had followed the S&amp;P 500 index and all dividends had been reinvested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a rough calculation that ignores taxes owed on dividends, but it&rsquo;s on the same scale as what the <em>National Journal</em> reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen said it&rsquo;s trickier to calculate the value of $200 million invested in 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Because the stock market in 1982 was quite volatile, the current value of $200 million investment in 1982 would depend on the time at which it was initially invested,&quot; Chen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it went in right at the end of 1981, it would be worth $6.7 billion. Invested in June 1982, the value today would be $8.3 billion. Invested at the end of 1982, it would be worth $9 billion. Again, in the neighborhood of what the <em>Journal</em> said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a huge debate over Trump&rsquo;s current net worth. Estimates from outsiders, such as Bloomberg and <em>Forbes</em>, range from about $3 billion to about $4 billion. Trump says he has closer to $9 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occupy Democrats shared an image that said if Trump had taken the money he got from his father and simply put it in a fund that tracked the S&amp;P 500, he&rsquo;d have $8 billion today. While it&#39;s true that Trump got a leg up from his father on the order of many tens of millions of dollars, this specific claim suffers from a key flaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to hit the $8 billion mark is to start with $200 million in 1982, and it&#39;s wrong to say that was&nbsp;Trump&#39;s father&#39;s money.&nbsp;While the father&#39;s business&nbsp;put Trump&nbsp;on the path to have $200 million in 1982, Trump himself had been running the company for eight years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-12-08T11:47:55.003114", "ruling_date": "2015-12-09T15:33:55", "ruling_headline": "Occupy Democrats graphic oversimplifies Trump's inheritance", "ruling_headline_slug": "occupy-democrats-say-simple-investment-trumps-fath", "ruling_link_text": "Only Trump's accountant knows for sure", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Occupy Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OccupyDemocrats/photos/pb.346937065399354.-2207520000.1449093733./1012752662151121/?type=3&amp;theater\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Facebook post</u></a>, Dec. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>London Review of Books</em>, <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n20/deborah-friedell/tycooniest\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Tycooniest</u></a>, Oct. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>National Journal,</em> <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/09/02/1-easy-way-donald-trump-could-have-been-even-richer-doing-nothing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The 1 Easy Way Donald Trump Could Have Been Even Richer: Doing Nothing</u></a>, Sept. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-28/here-s-our-tally-of-donald-trump-s-wealth\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Here&#39;s Our Tally of Donald Trump&#39;s Wealth</u></a>, July 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Forbes</em>, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2015/06/16/trump-exaggerating-his-net-worth-by-100-in-presidential-bid/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump Exaggerating His Net Worth (By 100%) In Presidential Bid</u></a>, June 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg View, <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-09-03/should-donald-trump-have-indexed-\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Should Trump Have Indexed?</u></a>, Sept. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Honghui Chen, associate professor of finance, University of Central Florida, Dec. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Omar Rivero, editor-in-chief, Occupy Democrats, Dec. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, S.V.
