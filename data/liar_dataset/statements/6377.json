Sarah Palin at a <a href=\"http://www.tedcruz.org/rally\">get-out-the-vote rally</a> north of Houston.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFiring up the crowd in her July 27, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/patriot-julie\">speech</a> in The Woodlands, Palin touched on some claims PolitiFact has recently addressed, plus one we haven&rsquo;t: &quot;One in seven American families are on food stamps.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on past PolitiFact work, Palin was batting better than .500 on these statements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>&quot;Thirty percent of our mortgages are underwater.&quot;</strong> More like 25 percent than 30 percent, as of January, but <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/jan/12/marcia-fudge/marcia-fudge-says-25-mortgage-borrowers-are-under-/\">pretty close</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Affordable Care Act is <strong>&quot;death-panel-filled&quot;</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/mar/19/pat-boone/pat-boone-says-health-care-advisory-board-can-rati/\">Still</a> a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/dec/18/politifact-lie-year-death-panels/\">Pants on Fire</a> claim.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>&quot;We&rsquo;re going on four years now without a federal budget.&quot;</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/02/paul-ryan/democrat-controlled-us-senate-has-gone-nearly-thre/\">Yes</a>. Specifically, when Palin spoke, <a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=04&amp;d1=29&amp;y1=2009&amp;m2=07&amp;d2=27&amp;y2=2012\">3 years, 2 months and 28 days</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\nSo how&rsquo;d she do with her food stamp claim? Another hit, according to the experts we asked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Alyn Kiel told us by email that Palin was correct -- in fact, one in seven individual Americans is on food stamps, aka the USDA&rsquo;s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kiel cautioned against translating SNAP&rsquo;s term &quot;households&quot; to &quot;families.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There is no single definition of a household,&quot; Kiel told us. &quot;The Census Bureau defines it one way (anyone who lives under the same roof together); SNAP defines it another (more strictly as a group that purchases and prepares food together, so you could, for example, have a household of one, which you cannot by the Census Bureau definition). The Census Bureau defines families even more strictly than households.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJ.C. Dwyer, state policy director of the Texas Food Bank Network, told us by email, &quot;Most of the time, a &lsquo;household&rsquo; is roughly equivalent to a &lsquo;family,&rsquo; and so contains more than one person. However, a single individual living alone is also considered a &lsquo;household.&rsquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;That&#39;s why one in seven individuals benefit from the program, and one in five households,&quot; Dwyer said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe sent us <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2Wzr4_cemD5bUM0SzlUSHY3SDQ\">USDA&#39;s monthly report</a> for May 2012, which shows that 22.3 million U.S. households encompassing 46.5 million individuals were on SNAP. He calculated the &quot;one in seven&quot; and &quot;one in five&quot; ratios using the U.S. Census <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html\">population clock</a> and average household size in 2010 (<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/families_households/cb10-174.html\">2.59</a> people), he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDwyer cautioned against tying increases in SNAP recipients to any specific president or government policy, noting that the national food bank network Feeding America has <a href=\"http://feedingamerica.org/how-we-fight-hunger/programs-and-services/public-assistance-programs/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program/snap-myths-realities.aspx#_ednref4\">reported</a> SNAP participation mirrors unemployment. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43174\">April 19, 2012, report</a> from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said that, nationwide, &quot;Spending on SNAP benefits more than doubled between 2007 and 2011.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/images/pubs-images/43xxx/SNAP_Infographic_4_18_2012.png\">Charts</a> from the report show an increase in participation after the recession began in 2007; CBO predicts the increase will peak in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rmOsp9lM2w1qqmtjJu8nGi1H5LUPvo8CvmXgHJrVZjd3-klhj3PkRN_AkVfMjU9Ap9-lRwkBZZG7KbKCZg1lNpGGP776BGZFvz_lZ0lGVYV018yNqr8\" style=\"height:406px; width:566px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Texas, SNAP participation has also risen compared to 2007, but has held fairly constant since early 2010.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJonathan Lewis, a specialist in food policy for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin, emailed us a <a href=\"http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/research/SNAP-Statewide.asp\">link</a> to state data showing that the number of Texans on SNAP has remained within the range of 3.5 million to 3.7 million since March 2010, when it was at 3.4 million. The total was 2.3 million in July 2007 and 3.6 million in July 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLewis told us, &quot;Palin&rsquo;s statement about one in seven families on SNAP in the U.S. is correct besides her use of families rather than households. However, I think the public views them as the same.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLewis included a link to the Texas Administrative Code&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=&amp;p_rloc=&amp;p_tloc=&amp;p_ploc=&amp;pg=1&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=1&amp;pt=15&amp;ch=372&amp;rl=2\">definitions</a> of families and households. For purposes of the SNAP program, the code defines a household as the person or persons included in a single SNAP case by state Health and Human Services. A family, the code says, is defined as a group of relatives living together and meeting certain other conditions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe state data show 1.5 million cases, or households, on SNAP in Texas for July 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nPalin&rsquo;s figure is supported and may even understate the share of families on food stamps.
