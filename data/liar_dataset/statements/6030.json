Jim Webb said funding for veterans services is much higher now than three decades ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The president&rsquo;s budget request for FY2013 veterans spending is $140 billion -- more than double the amount in constant dollars appropriated in 1980, when the veterans population was larger by a third,&quot; Webb, D-Va., said in a May 14 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWebb, who served as secretary of the navy under President Ronald Reagan, was referring to funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care and pensions to honorably-discharged service members who have been wounded or suffered illnesses in times of war.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHeather Fluit, a spokeswoman for Webb, said the senator got his data from a query to the Congressional Research Service, which provides non-partisan analysis of issues for Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked whether Webb was right about the increase in funding and whether the number of veterans is indeed lower today than three decades ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with the budget numbers. Webb claims the president&rsquo;s 2013 spending request is more double the amount in 1980 after the figures are adjusted for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident Barack Obama proposed a $140.3 billion budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs for the 2013 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJosephine Schuda, a spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, told us Congress appropriated $20.6 billion to the agency in fiscal 1980.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe adjusted that for inflation using the Consumer Price Index calculator on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. The appropriation in 1980 comes to $57.5 billion in modern-day dollars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Webb is right; the $140 billion request is more than double the amount appropriated in 1980, even after adjusting for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s look at how the size of the veterans population three decades ago compares to today.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSchuda said that in 1980, there were 30.1 million veterans. The most recent VA numbers show there were 22.2 million veterans in September 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means the number of veterans in 1980 was about one-third larger than today&rsquo;s veterans population. So Webb is right on this score, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy were there more veterans in the 1980s than today? Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said a big contributor is that there were more surviving World War II veterans back in 1980 than today.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTim Tetz, legislative director for the American legion, said a key reason VA funding has increased is that Congress in 1996 expanded the number veterans eligible to receive health care from the agency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe VA budget has significantly expanded over the last 10 years under Obama as well as former President George W. Bush. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are 5.5 million patients in the VA health care system today. In 1980, there was only a fraction of the amount, Tetz said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWebb said the president&rsquo;s $140 billion request for veterans services is more than double what it was in 1980, when the veterans population was a third larger than today.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s right. We point out that major increases to the VA occurred in the last decade under the Bush and Obama administrations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, we rate the senator&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-04T01:04:38.238504", "ruling_date": "2012-06-04T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
