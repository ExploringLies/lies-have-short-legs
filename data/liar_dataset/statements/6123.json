Let&rsquo;s get under the hood for some analysis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Michele Bachmann</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2011, two other fact-checking operations examined a statement by U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michele-bachmann/\">Michele Bachmann</a>, R-Minn, that is similar to Hovde&rsquo;s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Washington Post </em>Fact Checker <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/michele-bachmanns-too-good-to-be-true-stat-on-federal-workers/2011/08/15/gIQAZaqbHJ_blog.html\">evaluated</a> Bachmann&rsquo;s claim that only one DOT employee made $170,000 a year &quot;at the beginning of the recession. We had the trillion-dollar stimulus, and 18 months into the recession, we had 1,690 employees making over $170,000.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Fact Checker noted that Bachmann&rsquo;s claim almost exactly quoted a December 2009 <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-12-10-federal-pay-salaries_N.htm\">article</a> in <em>USA Today</em>, which reported on an increase in the number of all federal workers earning more than $100,000 since the recession started in December 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Hovde campaign spokesman Sean Lansing for evidence to back Hovde&rsquo;s claim, he cited the same sentence from the article, which said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When the recession started, the Transportation Department had only one person earning a salary of $170,000 or more. Eighteen months later, 1,690 employees had salaries above $170,000.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLansing noted the statistic was also <a href=\"http://cei.org/books/stealing-you-blind\">repeated</a> in <em>Stealing You Blind</em>, a July 2011 book published by conservative <a href=\"http://www.regnery.com/about.html\">Regnery Publishing</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut as The Fact Checker pointed out, <em>USA Today</em> made it clear that the recession began under President George W. Bush -- and that Bush had recommended across-the-board raises for federal employees. Those raises, after getting through Congress, resulted in boosts of 3 percent in January 2008 and 3.9 percent in January 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Fact Checker concluded &quot;it is clear that the bulk of the new salaries were instituted before (Obama) took office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org also <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2011/06/bachmanns-waterloo/\">said</a> Bachmann wrongly blamed Obama in her claim, concluding that at least two-thirds of the DOT employees were receiving more than $170,000 before Obama took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also asked the Obama administration to respond to Hovde&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoira Mack, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said there were 1,699 transportation employees who earned more than $170,000 when Obama took office. Nearly all worked in the Federal Aviation Administration, primarily in flight control towers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMack said that as of December 2011, the number had risen to 2,464. She attributed the increase of 765 employees during Obama&rsquo;s tenure to the Bush-led across-the-board pay increases as well as a collective bargaining agreement for air traffic controllers, signed under Obama, that provided 3 percent raises in 2010, 2011 and 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we pointed out the two fact checks and the OMB&rsquo;s information to Lansing, he said Hovde&rsquo;s main point is that the number of federal employees is &quot;exploding&quot; and their pay has gone up under Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde said that since Obama took office, &quot;you have 1,700 employees just at the Department of Transportation&quot; earning over $170,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tActually, there were that many federal transportation workers earning over $170,000 a year when Obama took office, largely as the result of raises pushed by President Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Hovde&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-20T16:38:09.084054", "ruling_date": "2012-06-21T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Under Obama, 1,700 transportation workers eclipse $170,000 per year, GOP Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde says", "ruling_headline_slug": "under-obama-1700-transportation-workers-eclipse-17", "ruling_link_text": "That level actually was reached due to Bush-era policies", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube.com, Eric Hovde radio <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMz_5ZRVts&amp;feature=g-all-u\">interview</a>, June 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Eric Hovde campaign spokesman Sean Lansing, June 13 and 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/michele-bachmanns-too-good-to-be-true-stat-on-federal-workers/2011/08/15/gIQAZaqbHJ_blog.html\">&quot;Michele Bachmann&rsquo;s too-good-to-be-true on federal workers,&quot;</a> Aug. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-You-Blind-Government-Getting/dp/1596981539/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0\">Stealing You Blind</a></em>, July 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>USA Toda</em>y, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-12-10-federal-pay-salaries_N.htm\">&quot;For feds, more get six-figure salaries,&quot;</a> Dec. 11, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactCheck.org, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2011/06/bachmanns-waterloo/\">&quot;Bachmann&rsquo;s Waterloo,&quot;</a> July 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, U.S. Office of Management and Budget spokeswoman Moira Mack, June 15 and 18, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Eric", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 1797, "last_name": "Hovde", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "eric-hovde", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Eric_Hovde_PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1797/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSince President Barack Obama took office, &quot;you have 1,700 employees just at the Department of Transportation&quot;
