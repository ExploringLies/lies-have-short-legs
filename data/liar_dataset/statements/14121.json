Scott Walker laid out his 2017-&rsquo;19 budget, he touted the &quot;historic investment in our priorities&quot; -- including K-12 education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that end, Walker declared: &quot;We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More money than ever before?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Walker&rsquo;s budget now before the Legislature&rsquo;s Joint Finance Committee, where it will undergo changes, we wondered if that was the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took a look at the budgets back to fiscal year 1991, which provides about 25 years of data and shows the trajectory before state funding jumped significantly in the late 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer, we found, depends on how you crunch the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Total state aid vs. inflation-adjusted</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, we took Walker&rsquo;s statement to mean K-12 education, not a picture that would include colleges and universities, and the &quot;we&quot; to refer to money directly from the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s based on the context <a href=\"https://walker.wi.gov/wiworking\">within Walker&rsquo;s Feb, 8, 2017, budget address</a> and the <a href=\"https://walker.wi.gov/sites/default/files/2017%20Budget%20Address%20Fact%20Sheet_K12.pdf\">K-12 education fact sheet</a> linked from the address itself. And when we reached out to Walker&rsquo;s office, a spokesman pointed us to <a href=\"http://doa.wi.gov/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/2017-19%20Executive%20Budget/17-19%20BIB%20FINAL%20revised%2002082017.pdf\">page 6 of the &quot;Budget in Brief,&quot;</a> where K-12 education is addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That page in the briefing document shows that state aid to schools for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (the years covered by Walker&rsquo;s budget) would be the highest in raw numbers -- at least back to fiscal year 2009, where the chart on the page ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $11.5 billion over the two years would amount to the largest tally in state history. That figure shakes out to $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when you compare figures over time, it&rsquo;s important to take inflation into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, costs grow, prices grow, the economy grows. Adjusting for inflation puts everything on an equal footing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get inflation-adjusted state aid, we took the raw numbers from <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2017/0024_state_aid_to_school_districts_informational_paper_24.pdf\">past</a> <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2003/0027_elementary_and_secondary_school_aids_informational_paper_27.pdf\">reports</a> from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and gathered data back to fiscal year 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put the figures through the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; inflation calculator</a> and also compared our inflation-adjusted numbers to those run by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Both calculations found that fiscal year 2003 was the highest inflation-adjusted year for state aid to schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That year, the raw total in state aid was $4.8 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the tally by the Taxpayers Alliance found that inflation-adjusted state aid that year totaled $6.5 billion. That&rsquo;s far more than the $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion proposed for the next two years in Walker&rsquo;s budget plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The bigger picture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although inflation-adjusted state aid is the best measure, we decided to examine another calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wisconsin, state aid doesn&rsquo;t tell the full story in terms of how much money is going to schools. What&rsquo;s known as the &quot;revenue cap&quot; imposes a limit on funding by local school districts. That means that without a referendum to exceed the limit, if state aid to schools goes up, local property taxes would go down, leaving a district with the same amount of funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, the state can give schools additional money outside the revenue cap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The revenue limit did not go up the last two years,&quot; said Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance. &quot;However, what they&rsquo;ve done is for the past about six years they&rsquo;ve been giving the schools money outside the revenue limit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That brings us to &quot;per-pupil&quot; funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knapp took the inflation-adjusted total of state aid and property taxes allocated to schools and divided that by full-time equivalent enrollment for fiscal years 1997 through 2017. If you slice the numbers that way, fiscal year 2011 is the highest at $13,112 per student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That compares to $12,329 in the current fiscal year. The challenge with calculating per-pupil aid is knowing enrollment numbers, which are difficult to predict for 2018 and 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knapp said even this number comes with another important caveat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Generally, per student funding has risen over the years, even after accounting for inflation,&quot; he said. &quot;That it peaked in 2011 is also not a surprise as funding was cut in 2012. However, Act 10 saved districts enough to cover those cuts. Thus, you have to be careful about how you think about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Essentially, school costs were reset at a lower level in that year, and they have generally been rising since.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said in his budget address -- and in the weeks and months since -- that Wisconsin is investing more in education than ever in the history of the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is true in raw dollars but the statement doesn&rsquo;t account for inflation-adjusted numbers, which is the best way to look at figures over time. When adjusted for inflation, fiscal year 2003 would be the highest ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Walker&rsquo;s claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-16T12:31:30.027518", "ruling_date": "2017-05-17T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Testing Scott Walker claim on record education funding in Wisconsin", "ruling_headline_slug": "testing-scott-walker-claim-record-education-findin", "ruling_link_text": "Not once inflation takes its toll", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gov.
