The wealth of the bottom 160 million was $245 billion, the&nbsp;Institute for Policy Studies&#39;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/ips-authors/josh-hoxie/\">Josh Hoxie</a> told us. That&rsquo;s a gap of $3.5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hoxie, a former a aide to Sanders, also pointed out that the wealth of the three billionaires has ballooned to $330 billion, according to Forbes&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/list/#version:realtime\">latest estimate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have an updated estimate for the bottom 160 million American, as the Fed survey is done only once every three years.
