William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to &quot;promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,&quot; according to a magazine editorial written by Church.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<em>After being granted a charter by the State of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. senator, became the fledgling NRA&#39;s first president.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<em>An important facet of the NRA&#39;s creation was the development of a practice ground. In 1872, with financial help from New York State, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened a year later, and it was there that the first annual matches were held.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNo mention of religious leaders, slaves or the KKK.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBrief histories of the NRA by <em><a href=\"http://live.wsj.com/video/a-brief-history-of-the-nra/3DDF033D-26D7-4979-B5CC-C995CF99467D.html#%213DDF033D-26D7-4979-B5CC-C995CF99467D\">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-12/national/36312206_1_nra-membership-harlon-carter-andrew-arulanandam\">The Washington Post</a></em> contain no such mentions, either.

It&rsquo;s from the University of Florida-produced documentary <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/negroeswithguns/rob.html\">&quot;Negroes with Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power&quot;</a>:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn 1956, Williams took over leadership of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was close to disbanding due to the Ku Klux Klan. Williams filed for a charter from the NRA and formed the Black Guard, an armed group committed to the protection of blacks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIt&#39;s unclear, however, whether the NRA provided any assistance, based on what Williams&#39; widow, Mabel, <a href=\"http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/K-0266/excerpts/excerpt_8789.html\">said</a> in a University of North Carolina oral history interview.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMabel Williams said her husband altered the occupations of the members when applying for the NRA charter. &quot;I&#39;m sure when we joined and the years after then, had they known we were a black group, they would have revoked our charter,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-75a1cc2c-fbfc-fb61-5d3e-ab2128429eca\">\r\n\tHarry Alford, the head of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, said the National Rifle Association was &quot;founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe can&rsquo;t say whether he was misinformed or intended to mislead.
