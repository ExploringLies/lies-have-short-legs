How big (and bad) is that?&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1014117468858650624\">tweeted</a> Trump, who <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1368/renegotiate-iran-deal/\">announced in May</a> that the United States was pulling out of the agreement to curb Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that the claim lacks evidence. Our fact-checking friends at <a href=\"https://factnameh.com/fact-checks/2018-07-05-2500-citizenship-iranians-jcpoa.html\">Factnameh</a>, a Canada-based website that fact-checks claims about Iran, found that the statement by the Iranian official has no evidence to back it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://factnameh.com/fact-checks/2018-07-05-2500-citizenship-iranians-jcpoa.html\">Factnameh.com</a> found that the original source of the claim was an anti-regime website called <a href=\"https://www.amadnews.org/archives/15773\">Amad News. </a>It published the claim on Feb. 14, 2017, quoting an anonymous &quot;informed source.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Fox News attributed report to one Iranian official</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News attributed its report to Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of Iran&rsquo;s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zolnour made the allegations during an interview with the country&rsquo;s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country&rsquo;s Fars News agency, a &quot;semi-official&quot; organ of the Iranian government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zolnour claimed that the citizenships were granted as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, Fox said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly referred to as the Iran deal), decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,&quot; he claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told Fox News, &quot;This sounds like totally made up B.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other officials in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nedprice/status/1014154818406043649\">Obama</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brhodes/status/1014181709879922688\">administration</a> also said the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-obama-give-citizenship-to-thousands-of-iranians-during-nuke-deal-discussions/\">statement was false</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Nephew, who works for Columbia University and was the State Department&rsquo;s lead sanctions expert from August 2013 to December 2014, told PolitiFact that the claim &quot;is entirely nonsense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would have made no sense for us to have done this and less sense for the officials to have agreed/requested citizenship,&quot; he said. &quot;While I was on the team, this wasn&#39;t even discussed, considered or thought about. I would bet any sum you&#39;d care to wager that this didn&#39;t come up after I left the talks. And, it is worth noting that after years of congressional inquiry into this, we never heard of it. I find it hard to believe that&#39;s because this one opposition politician in Iran was the only person who knew about it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/suzanne-maloney/\">Suzanne Maloney</a>, deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, who served on State&rsquo;s Policy Planning Staff from 2005-07, also expressed disbelief. (She held a part-time outside advisor role during the early part of Obama&rsquo;s administration.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maloney said the issue of U.S. citizenship or green cards has long been a contentious one within the Iranian establishment. There are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, typically dating from the pre-revolutionary period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also Iranian officials whose children have attended U.S. universities and stayed in the United States, or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Given the longstanding estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, the allegation alone is used as a smear, to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zolnour is a hard-line cleric, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So it&rsquo;s not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack, especially in the aftermath of President Trump&rsquo;s dismantling of the deal, which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement,&quot; Maloney said. &quot;And yes, Iranians of all political stripes are prone to indulging fairly creative conspiracy theories, especially hardliners and especially conspiracy theories about the U.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ali Vaez, the anti-war <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/ali-vaez\">Crisis Group&#39;s Iran Project Director</a>, told PoltiiFact that Zolnour is a firebrand who is well known for his false claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaez said that Zolnour is using this claim to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies as the parliament is trying to pass a bill to ban dual-nationals from serving in the Iranian government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed the Diamond and Silk website and did not get a reply. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment to Fox News, and we didn&rsquo;t get a reply to our email. State Department spokeswoman <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usdos/videos/10155565968971074/\">Heather Nauert</a> was asked about Trump&rsquo;s tweet at the July 3 press briefing and referred reporters to homeland security.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline on a Diamond and Silk&nbsp;website said &quot;Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article stemmed from a Fox News report which was based on comments by Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, an Iranian official, who made the allegation during an interview with the country&rsquo;s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country&rsquo;s semi-official Fars News agency. The report doesn&rsquo;t appear to include any actual evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News&rsquo; report contained no confirmation by U.S. government officials working in the Trump administration.
