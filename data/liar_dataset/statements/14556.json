Just pay taxes and port fees. You also will receive $100 per cabin OBC.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no mention of which 2017 hurricane sparked the offer, whether it be Harvey, which drenched Texas, or Irma, which blew through Florida (the &quot;OBC&quot; stands for on-board credit).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Carnival isn&rsquo;t offering such a deal, because the story is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not readily apparent, but BreakingNews247.net is one of a gaggle of websites that allow users to create their own stories, labeling them as &quot;prank&quot; articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below the text and some advertisements is a button that reads &quot;Create a Prank.&quot; Clicking on it allows a user to build their own fake story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/06/channel24newscom/story-about-checkers-shooting-came-fake-news-gener/\">written about similar sites before</a>. A range of websites allowing people to generate these kinds of stories have been reported by Facebook users for all manner of faux stories, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to curb fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some people may look at the sites as a way to create jokes, they open up the potential for a scam known as &quot;like farming.&quot; That&rsquo;s when users <a href=\"https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/like-farming-facebook-scams-look-before-you-like-042215.html\">create posts to gain as many likes as possible</a>. The scammers then use highly ranked links to spread malware, gain readers&rsquo; personal information or otherwise make money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This particular post <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article174338776.html\">first appeared sometime before Sept. 15</a>, according to the <em>Miami Herald</em>. It drew Carnival&rsquo;s attention after being posted on Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post suggested readers contact Heald, who is a <a href=\"https://johnhealdsblog.com/meet-john/\">real British Carnival cruise director</a>. Heald addressed the hoax on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JohnHeald/\">his own Facebook profile</a>, in which he engages Carnival customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is a fake page and we have reported the author accordingly,&quot; Heald wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JohnHeald/photos/a.156041891105047.26437.144285012280735/1831003770275509/?type=3&amp;theater\">Sept. 15 Facebook post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Heald said on the post that he was aware which Facebook group was spreading the fake story but didn&rsquo;t elaborate. He also called the original poster a &quot;soulless, heartless wanker&quot; and further talked about the issue in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JohnHeald/videos/1831104893598730/\">video posted to his profile</a> later that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">A Carnival spokeswoman confirmed that the story was false, although the company is <a href=\"https://www.carnival.com/hurricane-relief?icid=icp_ccl_content_relief_0916_hm_t3\">making monetary donations and helping ferry supplies to storm-affected areas</a>. Carnival reported the original Facebook post, which appeared to have been removed.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>But the fake story was still available at BreakingNews247.net. As of this writing, a counter on the article said it had been shared more than 83,000 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t pack your bags just yet, because there&rsquo;s no free pleasure cruise for hurricane victims.
