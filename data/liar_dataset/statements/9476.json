As Iraq once again becomes a big news story, as Islamic militants take over large portions of the country&rsquo;s north and threaten the capital in Baghdad, we thought it would be worth checking one of Clinton&rsquo;s claims about the American public&rsquo;s perceptions of the Iraq War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the seventh chapter of her memoir, Clinton writes that, &quot;by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that correct? We looked at polling data about the war between 2003 and 2006, archived at <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm\"><u>PollingReport.com</u></a>. (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/iraq-war-polls/\"><u>Here are the ones that fit the criteria for this fact-check</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, Americans felt favorably about the war. While the wording changes somewhat from poll to poll, the level of support for the war was usually at or above two-thirds in mid- March 2003, right before the war began. That month, support hit 70 percent in a <em>Newsweek </em>poll, 64 percent in a CNN/<em>USA Today</em>/Gallup poll, 65 percent in an NBC News/<em>Wall Street Journal </em>poll and 71 percent in an ABC News/<em>Washington Post </em>poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first few weeks after the attack was launched, support levels went as high as 77 percent in CBS News and <em>Los Angeles Times </em>polls, 78 percent in an ABC News/<em>Washington Post </em>poll and 81 percent in a Fox News poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as the war continued, support began to soften. Eventually, support turned negative in some polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By mid-May 2004 -- a little over a year after the start of the war -- <em>Time </em>and CNN asked, &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling the situation in Iraq?&quot; and found 44 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval. The numbers were similar when the pollsters asked, &quot;In general, do you approve or disapprove of current military policy in Iraq?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll -- which as late as June 2004 found support at 60 percent -- found by February 2005 that a plurality of respondents, 49 percent, said going to war was the &quot;wrong thing&quot; to have done, compared to 46 percent who said it was the &quot;right thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disapproval of Bush&rsquo;s handling of the war reached 58 percent in August 2005 in an Associated Press/Ipsos poll, and it remained roughly the same in a CNN/<em>USA Today</em>/Gallup poll in February 2006 and a CNN poll in May 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, in the second half of 2006, opposition the war began to hit 2-to-1 margins over support for the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2006, when CBS and the <em>New York Times </em>asked, &quot;Do you think the result of the war with Iraq was worth the loss of American life and other costs of attacking Iraq, or not?&quot; 63 percent said it was not worth it, compared to just 30 percent who said it was worth it. Then, in November 2006, <em>Time </em>asked about approval of Bush&rsquo;s handling of Iraq and found 65 percent disapproval and only 31 percent approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disapproval continued to rise slightly into 2007. AP found 68 percent disapproval of Bush&rsquo;s handling of Iraq in January 2007, and CNN/Opinion Research Corporation found 69 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the polling generally tracks with time timeline Clinton offered. The only question is whether disapproval rates in the low-to-mid 60 percent range qualifies as &quot;overwhelming.&quot; We were a little skeptical, so we asked some polling experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That is an awfully subjective call,&quot; said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll and co-founder of Pollster.com. &quot;I&rsquo;d be surprised if there were any consensus where that line falls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Blumenthal, the senior polling editor of the Huffington Post and the founding editor of Pollster.com, said the use of &quot;overwhelming&quot; strikes him as subjective, and depends on the context. &quot;What seems like an &#39;overwhelming&#39; victory margin in a competitive electoral contest might not seem quite as &#39;overwhelming&#39; in the context of attitudes about a particular policy issue,&quot; he said. &quot;I&rsquo;d guess I&rsquo;d be OK with 2-to-1 for the former, but 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 for the latter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Clinton, emailed us to say, &quot;In public opinion, if you&rsquo;re talking about 50-percent-plus opposition on an issue, I think most people would call that &lsquo;overwhelming.&rsquo;&quot; Vietor added that &quot;the 2006 elections, which went massively in the Democrats&rsquo; favor, were viewed as a response to the war.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that, &quot;by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war.&quot; Polling data shows that roughly 65 percent of the public opposed the war by the second half of 2006, but while that qualifies as strong opposition, the definition of &quot;overwhelming&quot; within the polling profession is more uncertain. On balance, we rate Clinton&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE, June 20, 2014, 11:45 am: </strong>This article has been updated to include a response from Clinton&#39;s staff received after the story was published.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-19T16:51:04.188562", "ruling_date": "2014-06-20T10:45:41", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says by 2006, Americans 'were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War'", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-2006-americans-were-overwhelm", "ruling_link_text": "Strongly against, yes. \"Overwhelmingly?\" Judgment call", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, <em>Hard Choices</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PollingReport.com, <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm\"><u>Iraq</u></a>, accessed June 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll and co-founder of Pollster.com, June 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Mark Blumenthal, senior polling editor of the Huffington Post and the founding editor of Pollster.com, June 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tommy Vietor, press aide to Hillary Clinton, June 20, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;By 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "her book, \"Hard Choices\"", "statement_date": "2014-06-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 1, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/1/", "subject": "Iraq", "subject_slug": "iraq", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 194, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/194/", "subject": "Polls and Public Opinion", "subject_slug": "polls", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
