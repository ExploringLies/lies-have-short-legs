(Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sent a Facebook message to Hauser asking for specifics, but didn&#39;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, legislation to improve the system passed Congress last spring with bipartisan support, contrary to the meme&#39;s assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May, the U.S. Senate <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/politics/veterans-health-care.html\">gave final passage</a> to a major overall of the health care system and sent it to Trump for his signature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure, S-2372 known as the VA MISSION Act, was designed to make it easier for veterans to get care from private physicians who are not in the VA system and, in theory, speed the delivery of care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/h189\">passed the House 347 to 70</a> on May 16, 2018.

All of the opponents were Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/s106\">passed the Senate 92 to 5</a> on May 23, 2018. Democrats made nearly half the winning votes. The &quot;Nay&quot; votes were cast by two Democrats, two Republicans and one Independent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, precisely two thirds of the Democrats in Congress voted for the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make the claim that &quot;Democrats blocked the VA healthcare bill&quot; strikes us a meme malpractice.
