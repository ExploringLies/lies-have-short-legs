Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, both trying to capture the tea party vote in the Republican primary, did earlier this week when posed a question about repealing the 17th Amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html\"> <u>17th Amendment</u></a> to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1913,<a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/17th-amendment/\"> <u>did away with state legislatures electing U.S. senators</u></a> and handed that power directly to the people. It begins, &quot;The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, the 17th Amendment was seen as a move away from corruption and toward purer democracy, according to an Oct. 10, 2013, <em>Austin American-Statesman </em><a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/weblogs/first-reading/2013/oct/10/tea-party-principles-dewhurst-and-patrick-want-do-/\"><u>news blog post</u></a> and an Oct. 16<em> Statesman </em><a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/let-legislature-not-voters-pick-us-senators/nbQFq/\"><u>news story</u></a>. But tea party activists, particularly in Texas, describe it as a mistake that reduced state power by undoing an intended balance between U.S. representatives elected locally by the people and U.S. senators more accountable to state legislators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Texas land commissioner Jerry Patterson, said in a <em>Waco Tribune-Herald </em><a href=\"http://www.wacotrib.com/opinion/interviews/conservatism-with-nuance-q-a-with-texas-land-commissioner-jerry/article_1443ef46-03b7-5b3d-bdd5-ef39d387c25d.html\"><u>interview</u></a> published Feb. 2 and in subsequent <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PTL52djhTVtjee9y-VhZwJbqg4TIX4dCvY2r0TKnE4w/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>emails</u></a> to us that Patrick and Dewhurst each said in an Oct. 3 debate that he favored repeal, then changed his tune at a Jan. 20 <a href=\"http://www.kingstreetpatriots.org/\"><u>King Street Patriots</u></a> debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patterson and another GOP candidate, Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples, who weren&rsquo;t asked about repeal at the October debate, each said at the later debate that he opposes repealing the amendment, according to a YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HFfOuI70dg\"><u>video</u></a> that King Street spokesman<strong> </strong>Logan Churchwell told us by phone accurately presented the candidates&rsquo; responses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To gauge whether Dewhurst and Patrick flip-flopped, we reviewed the cited debates, checked news accounts and reached out to their respective campaigns.<strong> </strong>(Our check of Dewhurst&rsquo;s statements is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/feb/13/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-went-you-betcha-kemosabe-i-would-no/\">here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Oct. 10<em> Statesman </em><a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/weblogs/first-reading/2013/oct/10/tea-party-principles-dewhurst-and-patrick-want-do-/\"><u>news blog post</u></a> quoted Patrick as saying at the Oct. 3 <a href=\"http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/cltp/pages/53/attachments/original/1380194312/Lt_Gov_Debate_Flyer.pdf?1380194312\"><u>debate</u></a> held in Houston by the <a href=\"http://www.clearlaketeaparty.com/lt_governor_candidate_debate\"><u>Clear Lake Tea Party</u></a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt; margin-right:45pt\">&quot;I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment and the restoration of our Founders&#39; original intent to have the state legislatures select our United States senators. ... It is absolutely necessary that the 17th Amendment be repealed to revitalize our republican system of government.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAt the Jan. 20 King Street <a href=\"http://www.kingstreetpatriots.org/events/lieutenant-governor-candidate-forum/1/\"><u>debate</u></a> in Houston, according to the YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HFfOuI70dg\"><u>video</u></a>, Patrick said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:54pt; margin-right:45pt\">&quot;I think this came up in a debate about four months ago. We&rsquo;ve had many debates. And I think either I misspoke or I was misquoted or it was reported incorrectly; I&rsquo;m not sure which. ... I would not be in position to support repealing it today. I was just taking a historical view of it and I think that was a turning point; it hasn&rsquo;t worked out, I think, as planned, but I would not be in favor of repealing it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that there was &quot;No flip. Dan just doesn&#39;t think now is the time to have that fight.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked how this &quot;not now&quot; position coheres with Patrick flatly saying at the January debate that he is not in favor of repeal. Spence replied that as a candidate for lieutenant governor, Patrick is not positioned to lead the charge for repeal &quot;now or in the near future.&quot; He also said, &quot;This must be my last time to address this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the October and January debates, Patrick shifted from saying &quot;I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment&quot; to &quot;I would not be in favor of repealing it.&quot; Given an opportunity to explain the contrast, his campaign said Patrick wouldn&rsquo;t be positioned as lieutenant governor to lead the repeal charge and that there would be no further clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our sense is that Patrick himself said he was for repeal, then said he is not.
