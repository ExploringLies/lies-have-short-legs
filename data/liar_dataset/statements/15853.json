The narrator goes into lengthy detail, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom, showed obscene images to female coworkers, commented about the chest sizes of middle-school girls, suggested one struggling student should brush up on her sex skills because it&#39;s the only thing she&#39;d ever be good at -- then intimidated the female teacher who complained.

Two courts, without ruling on whether the firing was illegal, concluded that the arbitrator <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/12/stronger-wisconsin/group-defending-governor-candidate-tony-evers-hand/\">was within her authority</a> in making her decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arbitrator based her decision in part on her determination that Harris&rsquo; behavior, given that students were not present when he viewed the images, did not endanger any students, as defined by state law.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/politifact.wisconsin/\">Like us on Facebook</a>.

Harris looked at pornographic material at school during the workday, via 23 emails sent by Harris&#39; sister, that included pornographic photos, jokes and movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Showed obscene images to female co-workers&rsquo;: </strong><a href=\"http://67.225.133.110/~gbpprorg/obama/Middleton_Porn_Case.pdf\">Correct</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commented about chest sizes, sex skills: </strong><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/daniel-bice/2017/11/02/bice-gop-rips-tony-evers-not-ousting-porn-viewing-teacher-accused-sexually-crude-remarks/824842001/\">Undetermined</a>. In the school district&rsquo;s investigation, an unidentified employee said Harris made the remarks. But the Department of Public Instruction, which Evers heads, said neither the arbitrator nor the department could determine whether Harris made the remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Intimidated the female teacher who complained&rsquo;: </strong><a href=\"https://wisgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/School-District-Summary-Report-of-Findings.pdf\">Correct</a>. The teacher who complained said Harris could sometimes be intimidating. The district&rsquo;s investigation found that emails Harris sent to the teacher &quot;suggests retaliation,&quot; but Harris denied they were retaliatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the first part of Walker&rsquo;s claim is partially accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the second part is more important, given that it contains the attack on Evers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&lsquo;Didn&#39;t revoke, teacher still in classroom&rsquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This part of the ad states &mdash; particularly in saying Evers should have revoked Harris&rsquo; license &nbsp;&mdash; that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when Harris was fired, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature&rsquo;s nonpartisan legal advisers, &quot;as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>And</em> is the pivotal word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers&rsquo; department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. The department has said it decided against that course after concluding Harris&rsquo; behavior didn&rsquo;t endanger kids, as defined by the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker, in effect, argues that Evers nevertheless should have tried revocation. But the lack of a legal basis to take away Harris&rsquo; license appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris&rsquo; firing, Walker signed a bill, supported by Evers, that redefined immoral conduct to specify that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the second part of Walker&rsquo;s statement is misleading in claiming that Evers could have revoked Harris&rsquo; license and simply didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Before he was fired, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district&rsquo;s two middle schools; <a href=\"https://mcpasd.k12.wi.us/our-district/about-district/staff-search?name=harris&amp;lookup=\">now he has the same job</a> at the other.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker says: &quot;A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom,&quot; along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn&#39;t revoke the teacher&#39;s license and &quot;the teacher is still in the classroom.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part of Walker&rsquo;s statement, about the teacher&rsquo;s behavior, is correct on two points; but on two other points, the validity of the allegations is unclear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the more important part of Walker&rsquo;s statement is misleading in saying Evers could have and didn&rsquo;t revoke the teacher&rsquo;s license. There was a lack of legal basis for revocation at the time &mdash; made clear by the fact that Walkers and Evers backed a change in state law so that teachers can be fired for viewing pornography at school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only elements of truth, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-12T18:56:29.654683", "ruling_date": "2018-09-13T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker misleads in claiming Tony Evers could have revoked teacher license in porn viewing case", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-misleads-claiming-tony-evers-could-ha", "ruling_link_text": "Saying Evers could have revoked is misleading", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtcOVH6FAM0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Scott Walker campaign TV ad</a>, Sept. 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Scott Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg, Sept. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Walker campaign, <a href=\"https://www.scottwalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ad-Fact-Sheet_Evers_Third.pdf\">Ad fact sheet</a>, Sept. 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Tony Evers campaign spokesman Sam Lau, Sept. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction spokesman Tom McCarthy, Sept. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://67.225.133.110/~gbpprorg/obama/Middleton_Porn_Case.pdf\">Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision</a> in Andrew Harris case, Feb. 28, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://wisgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/School-District-Summary-Report-of-Findings.pdf\">School district investigation</a> of Andrew Harris case, Feb. 8, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/29/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/hitting-back-group-defends-dem-governor-candidate-/\">&quot;Hitting back, group defends Dem governor candidate Tony Evers in handling of teacher porn case,&quot;</a> Aug. 29, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/06/republican-party-wisconsin/yes-explaining-gops-attack-governor-candidate-tony/\">&quot;Yes, but: Explaining GOP&#39;s attack on governor candidate Tony Evers on not revoking teacher&#39;s license,&quot;</a> Aug. 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/21/tony-evers-and-scott-walker-fighting-over-teacher-who-once-looked-pornographic-material-heres-rest-s/1017892002/\">&quot;Tony Evers and Scott Walker are fighting over a teacher who looked at porn at school &mdash;
