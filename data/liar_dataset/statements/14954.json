The fake story has several made up details including that the photo of the elderly man reportedly sentenced to death in California is actually of a drug trafficker caught in Kansas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said that in October 2015 William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, Calif., was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims -- Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeLisle, a Marine veteran, pulled a .22 from his ankle holster and shot both men within seconds, leaving one dead and the other paralyzed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said that the &quot;Dewey County Prosecutor&quot; said that because the two men were unarmed, the use of deadly force was &quot;extreme and unnecessary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no such Dewey County in California, although the county does exist in <a href=\"http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=DE018\">Oklahoma</a> and <a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/County_Profiles/South_Dakota/cp46041.pdf\">South Dakota</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo allegedly of DeLisle matches a photo of <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/11/22/drug-trafficker-exploits-read-like-hollywood-script/8LrA4LDCkqG6SnbAuVniNN/story.html\">Marshall Dion</a> taken in Junction City, Kan., when he was arrested on drug trafficking charges in 2013. Dion had a long, colorful history with law enforcement dating back to 1985 when he crashed an airplane in Wisconsin and crawled away, denying that $112,000 found inside and around the airplane belonged to him. In that incident, the government confiscated the money, suspecting it was drug money, but he wasn&rsquo;t charged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched the names of the alleged suspects in Nexis and found nothing in news accounts. We found nothing about an elderly William DeLisle in California, however, there was a <a href=\"http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hay_william_delisle\">19th century British pulp-fiction writer</a> by that name who in one book wrote about whites killing all blacks and Asians to create a paradise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fake news purveyors have published many false stories that cast Muslims in a negative light, including one about <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/21/freshmedianewscom/misleading-headline-says-412-michigan-muslims-bust/\">412 Muslims arrested in a Michigan bust</a> and another story claiming a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/dec/20/usa-front/pants-fire-fabricated-claim-about-muslim-immigrant/\">Muslim man started a California wildfire</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the headline that an &quot;82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty&quot; is also fake news.
