Separately, &nbsp;Nazgol Ghandnoosh of the Sentencing Project, which <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/about-us/\">says</a> it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, also laid out the methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, we built <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGMXgwcEcwbkN5Ylk/view?usp=sharing\">a chart</a> demonstrating that Hannity accurately drew his numbers from data presenting percentages of 32 federal offenses for which citizens, non-citizens and, in particular, &quot;illegal aliens&quot; were sentenced in fiscal 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ghandnoosh said by email that Hannity&rsquo;s percentages regarding five of the federal crimes accurately tracked the commission tallies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, those classified as &quot;illegal aliens&quot; accounted for 25,670, or 37 percent, of 70,225 individuals convicted of all federal crimes in the 12 months through September 2015. That includes 18,782 sentenced for immigration offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;illegal alien&quot; category accounted for the following share of convictions in the crimes cited by Hannity:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; 1,640 of 2,181 total convictions (75 percent) in which the primary charge was simple drug possession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; 13 of 43 convictions (30 percent) for kidnapping/hostage taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; 21 of 100 convictions (21 percent) for &quot;national defense&quot; crimes, which include convictions for exporting arms, munitions or military equipment without a license or providing material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations or for terrorist purposes, per a 2013 commission report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; 3,555 of 19,989 convictions (18 percent) for drug trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; 69 of 665 convictions (10 percent of them, for money laundering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; 5 of 91 convictions, or 5.5 percent, for murder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mwonyonyi noted another aspect by pointing out to us that 73 percent of all the &quot;illegal alien&quot; federal offenders in the year--that is, 18,782 of 25,670 individuals--were primarily sentenced for immigration violations unique to the federal government. &quot;If you take out the immigration crimes,&quot; Mwonyonyi wrote, &quot;you find that illegal aliens committed about 14% of all non-immigration federal crimes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sliced another way, the commission tallies show U.S. citizens drew 51 percent or more of all convictions across 29 offense categories including manslaughter (96 percent U.S. citizens); murder (84 percent); sexual abuse (95 percent); robbery (98 percent); drug trafficking (74 percent); bribery (93 percent); money laundering (76 percent); racketeering/extortion (87 percent); child pornography (96 percent); and burglary/breaking and entering (100 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably too, Hannity&rsquo;s chart presents percentages of unauthorized immigrants convicted of selected federal crimes--not exploring the residency statuses of the far greater number of U.S. residents prosecuted by state and local authorities. That&#39;s probably leaving out a lot of people. For instance, as of August 2016, Texas alone held <a href=\"https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/documents/Statistical_Report_FY2015.pdf\">some 146,800 state prison inmates</a>. As we completed this fact check, federal prisons altogether <a href=\"https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp\">held nearly 193,000 inmates</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannity&#39;s slide states that in fiscal 2015, &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; represented 5 percent to 75 percent of U.S. residents convicted of five federal crimes ranging from murder to simple drug possession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those figures accurately reflect federal data though a comprehensive picture would arguably fold in individuals convicted on similar state and local charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.
