Even though the story is months old, it continues to be shared widely on Facebook, which flagged it as part of its efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story &mdash; which again, is not true &mdash; says that 32-year-old Heather Watson of Baker County, Idaho, was sentenced to seven years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender for breastfeeding her 6-month-old daughter in public. The post said Watson had received six citations for indecent exposure before landing in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no outward indication the story is fake, but several clues should tip off readers this is a work of fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no other news reports of this incident, beyond blog posts from incensed mothers. There also is no record of a Heather Watson at the <a href=\"https://www.idoc.idaho.gov/content/prisons/offender_search\">Idaho Department of Correction offender search</a>. (We doubt the story is about the <a href=\"http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/6306805/title/konta-seals-second-win-for-great-britain\">British tennis player of the same name</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main photo used on the story is from a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/83850382@N02/16395229097/\">2014 post on a Flickr account</a>, with a chyron added to make it look like a screen grab from TV news. The inset mug is of a woman arrested in <a href=\"http://phoenixmugs.com/profile/3331669/elayne-blair-johnson-1/\">Maricopa County, Ariz., in 2016</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another giveaway is the location mentioned in the story: There is <a href=\"http://geology.com/county-map/idaho.shtml\">no Baker County in Idaho</a>. There&rsquo;s further reference to a location called Wiser, Idaho, but <a href=\"http://cityofweiser.net/\">the town is spelled Weiser</a>, and it&rsquo;s in Washington County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a phone number given as a way to contact the judge in the case at the fictional Baker County Department of Justice. When called, the phone number identifies itself as a voicemail service for the controversial <a href=\"http://www.godhatesfags.com/\">Westboro Baptist Church</a> in Topeka, Kan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story likely keys off Idaho&rsquo;s distinction as being <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx\">the only state without a law</a> specifically defending breastfeeding in public (although there is a law <a href=\"https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title2/T2CH2/SECT2-212/\">excusing nursing mothers from jury duty</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post links to a <a href=\"https://petitions.moveon.org/sign/idaho-needs-a-law-to\">MoveOn.org petition</a> supporting a new law, and there is a graphic illustrating where in the United States it is legal to breastfeed in public, taken from a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/map-where-its-legal-to-breastfeed-in-public_n_5637301.html\">2014 Huffington Post article</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Idahoans support a new law protecting mothers from being kicked out of businesses or charged with public indecency. The state reportedly has a <a href=\"http://boisestatepublicradio.org/post/why-more-idaho-moms-breastfeed-anywhere-us#stream/0\">higher rate of breastfeeding mothers</a> than any other state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Miss Idaho America Christi Van Ravenhorst <a href=\"http://www.kmvt.com/content/news/St-Lukes-Hospital-staff-trains-with-Idaho-Army-National-Guardsmen-371127691.html\">teamed up with a group</a> called the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/236896153055360/\">Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition</a> to push for a bill, and <a href=\"http://kboi2.com/news/local/moms-stage-nurse-in-for-public-breastfeeding\">mothers staged a &quot;nurse-in&quot;</a> on the steps of the state Capitol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline on this post, meanwhile, continues to draw the ire of breastfeeding supporters with its fake details.
