The site has a name, <a href=\"https://youngkimforcongress.org/\">YoungKimforCongress.org</a>, that makes it easily mistaken for the website of Cisneros&rsquo; opponent, Young Kim. But the Democrat-created website&rsquo;s content and slogan -- &quot;Just like Donald Trump&quot; -- &nbsp;are anything but flattering to Kim, a Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site has a lot to chew on, but standing out to PolitiFact was a section on Kim&rsquo;s personal taxes. It says Kim is &quot;a tax cheat&quot; who &quot;illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn&rsquo;t living in,&quot; had &quot;multiple tax liens placed on her&quot; as a result and &quot;owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cheat&quot; and &quot;illegally&quot; are serious words. To understand them fully here, let&rsquo;s look at the facts, with a little teaser to get started: The property taxes we&rsquo;re discussing amounted to $387.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The home issue</div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you own a home, you pay property taxes on it. But many states give a tax break to people who live in their homes. This is called a homeowner&rsquo;s or homestead exemption, and in California it is relatively small. By claiming it, a California homeowner can reduce the assessed value of his or her home by a maximum of $7,000 -- which saves the homeowner <a href=\"http://www.ocgov.com/gov/assessor/faq/exempt\">about $70 </a>a year in actual taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim and her husband, Charles, owned a home in the Orange County community of La Habra, and had a homeowner&rsquo;s exemption through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. But Kim had moved to a different home in a different community, Fullerton, in late 2012, and in January 2013 changed her voter registration to reflect this. She moved again to a third home, in Fullerton, in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim and her husband still owned the home in La Habra -- renting it out as income property -- and still got the homeowner&rsquo;s exemption. Under California law, homeowners are only supposed to get the exemption if they live in the home. This meant the Kims continued to get a $74 annual benefit she and her husband weren&rsquo;t entitled to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Orange County realized this, it filed two liens against the Kims for &quot;unsecured property taxes,&quot; one for <a href=\"https://youngkimforcongress.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/5.pdf\">$197.96</a> and the other for<a href=\"https://youngkimforcongress.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/6.pdf\"> $189.39</a>, on Oct. 13, 2015. Such liens typically included a penalty and interest, Orange County Assessor Claude Parrish told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The county <a href=\"https://youngkimforcongress.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/7.pdf\">lifted the liens </a>on Sept. 30, 2016, after the Kims paid. The total penalty: $387.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Mail confusion</div>\r\n\r\n<p>These basic facts, most of them noted or available through links in the spoof Kim website, were confirmed independently by PolitiFact through Orange County public records, interviews and a financial disclosure form Kim filed after she was elected to the California State Assembly in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of these address an important point: Did Kim dupe the county -- was she a &quot;tax cheat&quot; -- so she could save $74 a year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parrish, the county tax assessor, told us the liens should never have been issued. Parrish said this in 2016 as well, when the matter arose during Kim&rsquo;s unsuccessful re-election campaign for the State Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parrish, whose office is nonpartisan but who has served as a Republican in previous offices, issued a statement during that race, saying Kim had notified his predecessor in 2014 &quot;that she was no longer living at the home in question as of December 2012 and thus was not eligible for the homeowner&rsquo;s exemption.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; his statement continued, &quot;notices from the county in regard to this property were mailed to Ms. Kim at an old address and not forwarded to her, a common problem when people move. Through no fault of her own, a lien was placed on her property for a small amount of taxes due. This happens to innocent taxpayers like Ms. Kim all too often, and is a direct result of the notices not being properly forwarded by the U.S. Postal Service.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a telephone interview, Parrish told us, &quot;This could happen to anybody.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parrish has crusaded on this very issue --&nbsp;thousands of liens issued for very small amounts, potentially harming the credit of residents -- for several years. He said that 62 percent of his county&rsquo;s 45,331 liens in 2015 were for $200 or less, many a result of oversight or mistakes. Parrish pushed successfully for a 2017 California bill that authorized counties to stop issuing tax liens if the amount owed is $200 or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the amount, did Kim owe the money?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Kim notified the assessor&rsquo;s office in 2014 of a move that occurred in late 2012, that suggests at least a year went by before giving the proper notice. The mail issues then complicated matters, as did the fact that, according to Kim&rsquo;s current campaign, she paid her property taxes through the escrow account on her mortgage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Kim&rsquo;s 2016 state Assembly race, her political opponent, Sharon Quirk-Silva, said these were excuses that didn&rsquo;t exempt Kim from her obligations as a taxpayer. Quirk-Silva&rsquo;s campaign at the time issued <a href=\"https://capitolmr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sharon-Quirk-Silva.pdf\">a critical statement </a>from a retired Los Angeles County tax assessor, Kenneth P. Hahn, who said, &quot;The law is clear. Failure to receive notice from the U.S. Postal Service does not absolve an individual from paying their taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim&rsquo;s current campaign says this is a bit much. The discussion, after all, is over $74 a year, or $387 after penalties and interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The income taxes</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cisneros campaign also noted on its faux Kim website that Kim and her husband owe $10,000 to $15,000 to the IRS. This information comes directly from the <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2018/10019908.pdf\">financial disclosure report</a> Kim filed this year as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under creditors, she listed $10,000 to $15,000 owed to the IRS, with the description, &quot;Installment of taxes due for 2009 &amp; 2010.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick Mocete, Kim&rsquo;s campaign manager, told us the debt is a result of taxes due from her husband&rsquo;s employment as a self-employed consultant, and he set up an installment payment plan with the IRS. That&rsquo;s perfectly legal.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cisneros campaign says Kim is &quot;a tax cheat&quot; who &quot;illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn&rsquo;t living in,&quot; had &quot;multiple tax liens placed on her&quot; as a result and &quot;owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IRS debt is more substantial than the property tax, but there is no information to show it has anything to do with cheating. &quot;Cheat&quot; implies motivation, and news stories have used the word to describe people who purposely violated homestead exemption laws to save on taxes -- typically saving much more than $74 a year. Nic Jordan, the Cisneros campaign spokesman, told us the campaign used the word colloquially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether a mistake or not, Kim had two liens and owed $387 to the county as a result of an improperly recorded homeowner&rsquo;s exemption. The law is the law, as Kim&rsquo;s last opponent said. But it was a minor civil matter, and one that the current property assessor says never should have resulted in liens. Cisneros focused on the $7,000 annual reduction in the house&rsquo;s assessment, not mentioning on the spoof website that it made a difference of $74 a year. This makes it sound far worse than it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these elements combined, we rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-02T09:41:46.512810", "ruling_date": "2018-11-02T10:33:05", "ruling_headline": "Spoof website goes too far when calling California candidate Young Kim a tax cheat", "ruling_headline_slug": "spoof-website-goes-too-far-when-calling-california", "ruling_link_text": "Blown out of proportion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://youngkimforcongress.org/\">Fake website </a>with real content from Gil Cisneros campaign</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone and email conversations with Nic Jordan, Cisneros campaign spokesman, Oct. 30 and 31, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orange County property tax records for La Habra home of Young and Charles Kim, 2010 to 2015, accessed Oct. 31, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orange County tax liens and release of liens on Young and Charles Kim, 2010-2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orange County registrar of voters, phone verification of voter registrations and dates, Oc. 31, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone and email conversations with Patrick Mocete, Kim campaign manager, Oct. 31, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone conversation and emailed documents, Orange County Assessor Claude Parrish, Oct. 31, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone conversation with Glenna Schultz, senior specialist property appraiser, California Board of Equalization, Oct. 31, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.boe.ca.gov/lawguides/property/current/ptlg/rt/503.html\">California law</a> on assessment, penalties and taxation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Fair Political Practices Commission, Young Kim Statements of Economic Interest, filed in <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/documents/form700/2014/Legislature/Assembly/R_Kim_Young.pdf\">2015</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/documents/form700/2015/Legislature/Assembly/R_Kim_Young.pdf\">2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young Kim&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2018/10019908.pdf\"> financial disclosure report</a>, U.S. House of Representatives, filed Feb. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://capitolmr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sharon-Quirk-Silva.pdf\">Statement </a>from Kenneth P.
