I would like to see them go even lower.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We are fairly certain we know what Trump meant to say. But that&#39;s not what he said.&nbsp;(The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What Trump likely meant to say</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On the one hand, the American Automobile Association told PolitiFact that gasoline prices on Independence Day weekend were the lowest they have been in 12 years -- since 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Gas prices have been declining since the beginning of June,&quot; said Jeanette Casselano, a spokesperson for AAA. &quot;At $2.23, today&rsquo;s national gas price average is the cheapest price we&rsquo;ve seen since January. &quot;The combination of tepid demand and increasing gasoline and crude output continues to put downward pressure on gas prices, and motorists are benefitting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s value in comparing gas prices using a narrow window of time like the July 4 weekend, because comparing, for example, summer prices to winter prices is like comparing apples and oranges.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What Trump actually said</div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the way Trump phrased his tweet was more expansive. Rather than limiting the comparison to the July 4 weekend, the tweet suggests that at no point over the last decade-plus have gas prices been lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that would not be correct, according to data from the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&amp;f=W\">Energy Information Administration</a>, a federal office.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 85 weeks in which gas cost less than $2.26 per gallon, the price it was at the time of Trump&rsquo;s tweet. That means that for about one-sixth of the time over the last decade, gas cost less than it does now. (The EIA data does mirror AAA&rsquo;s assessment for Fourth of July weekend prices.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Energy Information Administration&rsquo;s data set uses nominal dollars rather than inflation-adjusted dollars, so just to be certain, we ran the data through the federal <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">inflation calculator</a> to see how adjusting for inflation affected that number. The answer: 58 weeks. That&rsquo;s still about one-ninth of the last decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump&#39;s role in gas prices</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the question of whether Trump deserves bragging rights. In general, presidents have rarely had a direct impact on the price of gasoline, said Philip Verleger, an economist and head of the energy consulting firm PKVerleger LLC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only one who had an impact was Jimmy Carter, who instituted price controls that managed to ball up the distribution of gasoline, leading to lines at gas stations,&quot; he said. Overall, presidents are &quot;not a big factor&quot; on gasoline prices, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, gas cost less during much of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s last year in office than it does now.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump tweeted, &quot;Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump likely meant to say that gas prices on the July 4 weekend are lower now than at any point since 2005. But Trump tweeted something&nbsp;more sweeping -- that gas prices haven&rsquo;t been lower in more than a decade. That&rsquo;s not correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such,we rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-05T15:18:33.761101", "ruling_date": "2017-07-06T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Is Donald Trump right that gas prices are now lowest in over 10 years?", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-right-gas-prices-now-lowest-over-10-y", "ruling_link_text": "Except for 85 other times", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/882327018070790144\">tweet</a>, July 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Information Administration, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&amp;f=W\">Weekly U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices (Dollars per Gallon)</a>,&quot; accessed July 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">inflation calculator</a>, accessed July 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jonathan Cogan, U.S. Energy Information Administration spokesman, July 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with&nbsp;Jeanette Casselano, spokesperson for the American Automobile Association, July 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Philip Verleger, head of the energy consulting firm PKVerleger LLC, July 5, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2017-07-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Is Donald Trump right that gas prices are now lowest in over 10 years?"}
