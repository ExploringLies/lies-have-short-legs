Improving early education would help eliminate costs associated with students being held back, Sink contends.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Florida spends more than $300 million a year just on children repeating pre-K through 3rd grade,&rsquo;&rsquo; Sink says on her <a href=\"http://www.alexsink2010.com/agenda?id=0011\">campaign website</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to look further into Sink&rsquo;s claim. Is Florida in fact spending $300 million to educate children who had to repeat at least one of those grades?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSink campaign spokeswoman Kyra Jennings said the $300 million figure was arrived at by multiplying the number that Florida spends per public school student ($7,000) by the approximate number of students from pre-K through third grade who were held back a grade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $7,000 in spending is actually $6,871 according to figures provided by the Department of Education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe campaign referred us to a February 2009 Florida Department of Education <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/eias/eiaspubs/word/nonpromotions.doc\">report </a>that indicates nearly 43,000 public school students between kindergarten and third grade were held back during the 2007-08 school year. (The exact figure, according to the report was 42,885 students.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the multiplication essentials we learned in third grade, we were able to verify that Sink&rsquo;s numbers did round up to the figure she cited on her website. (42,855 X $6,871 = $294,456,705)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, a more recent <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/eias/eiaspubs/word/nonpro0809.doc\">March 2010 report</a>, provided by the Department of Education, shows a slight decrease in the number of students not promoted a grade level during the 2008-09 school year. Last year, 39,469 students in kindergarten through third grade were held back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the more current figure, the state spent close to $271 million on remediation of those students last school year. (39,469 x $6,871 = $271,191,499).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy are there so many elementary school students being held back each year? An analysis from the DOE points to &quot;state laws requiring mandatory retention of third grade students who are not reading at grade level by the end of the school year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, it&rsquo;s important to note that the number of students held back a year has started to drop since the 2005-2006 school year and the figures are in the <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/eias/eiaspubs/word/nonpro0809.doc\">third page of DOE&rsquo;s </a><a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/eias/eiaspubs/word/nonpro0809.doc\">report</a>. If that trend continues, the state will continue to spend less on remedial education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo back to the claim. Does Florida spend $300 million on remedial education for students held back between pre-K through third grade. The report Sink&rsquo;s campaign cited was not the most recent, therefore their numbers are off by a couple of million. But, with the state spending close to $271 million in education for those children held back, we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-21T18:00:48.111720", "ruling_date": "2010-09-21T18:52:02", "ruling_headline": "Alex Sink: Florida spends $300 million on remedial pre-K through third grade students", "ruling_headline_slug": "alex-sink-florida-spends-300-million-students-held", "ruling_link_text": "Big numbers, simple math, claim mostly adds up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/eias/eiaspubs/word/nonpro0809.doc\">Data Report:Non-Promotions in Florida&rsquo;s Public Schools 2008-09</a>, March 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/eias/eiaspubs/word/nonpromotions.doc\">Data Report: Non-Promotions in Florida&rsquo;s Public Schools 2007-08</a>, February 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, Statistical Brief: Non-Promotions in Florida&rsquo;s Public Schools, 2006-07, January 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlex Sink Campaign <a href=\"http://www.alexsink2010.com/agenda?id=0011\">Website</a>, Sept. 21, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone&nbsp;and e-mail interview with Kyra Jennings, Alex Sink&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, Sept. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Miami Herald, &quot;Sink unveils plan for school changes,&quot; Sept. 1, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSt. Petersburg Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/schools/2009/07/how-much-do-we-really-spend-per-student-in-florida.html\">How much do we spend per student</a>,&quot; July 1, 2009</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Alex", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 299, "last_name": "Sink", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "alex-sink", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Alex_Sink.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/299/", "total_count": 19, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.alexforcongress.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Florida spends more than $300 million a year just on children repeating pre-K through 3rd grade.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "figures cites on campaign website", "statement_date": "2010-09-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
