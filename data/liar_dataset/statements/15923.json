Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is attacking Manchin for not being a big enough advocate for gun rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Sept. 7 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorriseyWV/status/1038104596772777984\">tweet</a>, Morrisey said, &quot;Joe Manchin has a &quot;D&quot; rating from the NRA, and fought alongside Obama and Schumer for anti-gun legislation.&quot; The NRA is the National Rifle Association, the nation&rsquo;s largest gun-rights group, while Obama is former President Barack Obama and Schumer is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll focus on the NRA rating for Manchin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nrapvf.org/articles/20180905/nra-launches-ad-campaign-against-manchin\">news release</a>, the NRA said Manchin has earned a D rating from the group this year. In the same news release, the group said it was endorsing Morrisey and airing ads on his behalf in the Charleston and Bluefield markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.,&quot; said Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that the NRA has given Manchin a D rating this year. But the group hasn&rsquo;t always been so negative about Manchin -- something the ad glosses over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he <a href=\"https://www.nrapvf.org/articles/20041022/nra-pvf-endorses-manchin-for-governor\">received an &quot;A+&quot; rating</a> from the NRA and received the group&rsquo;s endorsement when running for governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://www.nrapvf.org/articles/20100923/nra-pvf-endorses-joe-manchin-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia\">2010</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nrapvf.org/articles/20121002/nra-pvf-endorses-joe-manchin-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia\">2012</a>, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an &quot;A&quot; rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans,&quot; Cox wrote in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin&rsquo;s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/apr/30/summary-manchin-toomey-gun-proposal/\">proposed legislation</a> that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRA Political Victory Fund website doesn&rsquo;t allow for searches of past ratings, although it once did, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/06/12/the-nra-appears-to-pull-old-legislator-grades-from-its-website/?utm_term=.2cdd54991846\">reported</a> in June 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked by the Post for the rationale for removing past grades, Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman, said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t understand &mdash; why are you asking? What does it matter to you? The grades are not relevant after the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey tweeted that &quot;Joe Manchin has a &lsquo;D&rsquo; rating from the NRA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s certainly the case for 2018, and the NRA has endorsed Morrisey over Manchin this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this ignores that in previous campaigns, Manchin received &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;A+&rsquo; ratings from the NRA and won the group&rsquo;s endorsement those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-27T09:24:05.025652", "ruling_date": "2018-09-28T09:38:02", "ruling_headline": "Does Joe Manchin have a D rating from the National Rifle Association?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-joe-manchin-have-d-rating-national-rifle-asso", "ruling_link_text": "Correct for 2018;
