Graham&rsquo;s formulation was a bit narrower than the newspaper&rsquo;s: Her &nbsp;post said &quot;students&quot; rather than individuals &quot;at schools,&quot; and &quot;in combat zones&quot; rather than &quot;while serving in the military.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either of the definitions is plausible; as it happens, Graham&rsquo;s parameters make an even stronger case than the <em>Post</em> article does.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Students killed in school shootings</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We found five shooting incidents that resulted in student fatalities in 2018.

Each of these incidents resulted in one American service member&rsquo;s death, except for the one on March 15, in which seven airmen died in the crash of an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter in western Iraq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the total number of deaths in 2018 for Operation Inherent Resolve is 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, there have been two deaths this year in Operation Freedom&rsquo;s Sentinel. They occurred on <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1407143/dod-identifies-army-casualty/\">Jan. 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1509258/dod-identifies-army-casualty/\">April 30</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Total: 13 service members were killed in combat zones in 2018. </strong>That&#39;s half the number of student deaths in school shootings this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Some caveats</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first caveat to consider is that today&rsquo;s snapshot in time is unusual in recent history. Specifically, the number of school-shooting deaths is unusually high in 2018, <a href=\"https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings\">according to the <em>Post</em>&rsquo;s database of school shootings</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through May 18 of 2017, there were two deaths in school shootings. Through May 18 of 2016, it was one; for 2015 it was zero; and for 2014 it was one. Looking at full-year totals, the Post article found that the number of military deaths in 2017 exceeded 30, compared to five school-shooting deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second caveat to know involves the death rate &mdash; that is, deaths divided by the total population at risk of death. The death rate remains significantly higher for members of the military in combat zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are currently an <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_203.10.asp?current=yes\">estimated</a> 50.8 million students enrolled in K-12 classes. That&rsquo;s vastly larger than the combination of personnel serving in the two military operations cited above, which is <a href=\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/inherent-resolve.htm\">less than</a> <a href=\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/freedoms-sentinel.htm\">20,000</a> people, according to publicly disclosed data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Post</em> article that Graham linked to made this point. &quot;The figures for 2018 do not suggest schools are more dangerous than combat zones,&quot; the article said. &quot;So far in 2018, a member of the military has been about 40 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Graham wrote, &quot;So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the numbers, she is right. This year at least, within Graham&rsquo;s stated parameters, exactly twice as many students have died in school shootings than military personnel have died in combat zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to know, however, the likelihood of being killed in a combat zone is still vastly higher than it is in a school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-21T15:10:45.871026", "ruling_date": "2018-05-21T15:35:56", "ruling_headline": "Have more students been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones?", "ruling_headline_slug": "have-more-students-been-killed-schools-soldiers-co", "ruling_link_text": "Definitely correct this year", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gwen Graham, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GwenGrahamFL/posts/1949744578432414\">Facebook post</a>, May 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/18/2018-has-been-deadlier-for-schoolchildren-than-service-members/?utm_term=.fe0b55939afe\">2018 has been deadlier for schoolchildren than service members</a>,&quot; May 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings\">database of school shootings</a>, accessed May 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Department, news release archive for casualties, accessed May 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Military casualty news releases and school shooting news coverage: linked in article</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://icasualties.org/\">Icasualties.org</a>, accessed May 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Center for Education Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_203.10.asp?current=yes\">Table 203.10.
