Michelle Obama had said in a <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/10/13/michelle-obama-slams-donald-trump-for-bragging-about-sexually-predatory-behavior/\">speech on Oct. 13</a>, without mentioning Trump by name, that a 2005 recording had shown the GOP nominee admitting to &quot;sexually predatory behavior.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence appeared on <em>CBS This Morning</em> <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-i-dont-understand-michelle-obamas-critique-of-trump/\">on Oct. 14</a> and sounded puzzled by Michelle Obama&rsquo;s comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look I have a lot of respect for the first lady,&quot; he said. &quot;But I don&rsquo;t understand the basis of her claim.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s about as far as Pence&rsquo;s comments went. He never called Obama vulgar, and certainly not the most vulgar first lady ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because Politicono.com is a website (its slogan is &quot;Just Enough News&quot;) that takes a kernel of real news and sprouts an entire fabricated story around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It says readers <a href=\"http://politicono.com/about-us/\">come to the site</a> to read &quot;a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, at the top of the Pence story are two buttons: &quot;Show facts&quot; and &quot;hide facts.&quot; Clicking the &quot;show facts&quot; button highlights only the first paragraph of the story. The rest is entirely made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicono.com didn&rsquo;t respond to our requests for comment, but when we talked to them for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/30/viral-image/facebook-post-accuses-us-rep-ted-yoho-wanting-stri/\">another fact-check in 2015</a>, an administrator pointed out they admit some content is exaggerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That makes the website less culpable than many others that give no indication something may be contrived, but it&rsquo;s still not immediately apparent the story is fake. It&rsquo;s also very misleading to build upon a real event and then purposely obscuring which part is true and which is not. The comments section on the story itself certainly shows many have been fooled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, Pence did not call the first lady vulgar. We rate the headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/db2cffb7-ed7c-43c0-bec1-ef2b2a47a828\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/db2cffb7-ed7c-43c0-bec1-ef2b2a47a828</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-20T16:12:12.318548", "ruling_date": "2016-12-20T16:07:59", "ruling_headline": "Website makes up story that Mike Pence called Michelle Obama vulgar", "ruling_headline_slug": "satirical-site-made-story-mike-pence-called-michel", "ruling_link_text": "Obfuscates comments from a real news event", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Politicono.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://politicono.com/pence-michelle-obama-vulgar-first-lady-weve-ever/\">Pence: &lsquo;Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We&rsquo;ve Ever Had&rsquo;</a>,&quot; Oct. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/10/13/michelle-obama-slams-donald-trump-for-bragging-about-sexually-predatory-behavior/\">Michelle Obama Slams Donald Trump for Bragging About &lsquo;Sexually Predatory Behavior&rsquo;</a>,&quot; Oct. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>CBS This Morning</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-i-dont-understand-michelle-obamas-critique-of-trump/\">Mike Pence: &quot;I don&#39;t understand&quot; Michelle Obama&#39;s critique of Trump</a>,&quot; Oct. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/30/viral-image/facebook-post-accuses-us-rep-ted-yoho-wanting-stri/\">Facebook post accuses U.S. Rep.
