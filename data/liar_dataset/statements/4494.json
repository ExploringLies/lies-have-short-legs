Rick Perry has railed&nbsp;against&nbsp;the Obama administration for failing to adequately invest in border security in Texas. At the Fox News Google debate in Orlando Sept. 22, 2011, he took it a step further, saying &quot;the federal government has not engaged in (border security) at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; \">\r\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; \">We were under the impression (<a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Federal_Funds/Other_Publications/Homeland_Security_Funding_Texas_1108.pdf\" id=\"zn:a\" title=\"as is the state of Texas\">as is the state of Texas</a>) that the U.S. government is responsible for protecting the nation&#39;s borders, so this caught us by surprise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&#39;s how the debate unfolded:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Fox News Sunday </em>host Chris Wallace asked former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum whether he thought Perry was soft on illegal immigration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>SANTORUM: And so, yes, I would say that (Perry) is soft on illegal immigration. I think the fact that he doesn&#39;t want to build a fence -- he gave a speech in 2001 where he talked about, bi-national health insurance between Mexico and Texas. I mean, I don&#39;t even think Barack Obama would be for bi-national health insurance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I think he&#39;s very weak on this issue of American sovereignty and protecting our borders and not being a magnet for illegal immigration, yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWALLACE: Governor Perry, 30 seconds to respond, sir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: I&#39;ve got one question for him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave you ever even been to the border with Mexico?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: I&#39;m surprised if you have, but you weren&#39;t paying attention, because the idea that you --<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: Well, the answer is, yes, I have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: -- are going to build a wall, a fence for 1,200 miles, and then go 800 miles more to Tijuana, does not make sense. You put the boots on the ground.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe know how to make this work. You put the boots on the ground. You put the aviation assets --<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: But it&#39;s not working, Governor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: -- in the ground. No, it&#39;s not working because the federal government has not --<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: But you said we know how it works. Is it working in Texas?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: <strong>The federal government has not engaged in this at all.</strong> When I&#39;m the president of the United States, I&#39;ll promise you one thing --<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: But you&#39;re saying you put the assets there. Has it worked in Texas?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: -- we will put the assets on the ground --<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: You said you have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: -- the boots on the ground --<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBAIER: Senator Santorum, let him finish, please.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPERRY: -- the aviation assets on the ground, and we will stop illegal immigration, we will stop the drug cartels, and we will make America secure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: Can you answer the question? Is it working?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWALLACE: Well, you know, you asked your question, he gave his answer, sir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSANTORUM: OK.</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, according to Perry, the goverment needs to get boots, among other assets, on the ground to stop illegal immigration, stop drug cartels and secure the country.
