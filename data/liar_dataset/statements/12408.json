It&rsquo;s important in Bowling Green. It&rsquo;s important in Northern Kentucky. It&rsquo;s important across this commonwealth. That&rsquo;s a big difference between me and my opponent in the primary. I voted to save the auto industry, he voted not to. It&rsquo;s important to know that it was the right vote because we just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/hillary-clinton/michigan-hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-was-a/\">looked into how</a> Clinton&rsquo;s primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted on the auto bailout, which totaled an estimated <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/national/200904_CREDITCRISIS/recipients.html\">$85 billion</a>. But we were also curious about Clinton&rsquo;s claim that 2015 was &quot;the best year for the auto industry in America in history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is true by one big measure: Americans bought more cars and trucks in 2015 than ever before. But that success might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers&rsquo; growing market share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, Americans bought more than 17.5 million cars. The last peak was 17.3 million in 2000, followed by a collapse to 10.4 million at the height of the recession in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the past six years have been the longest period of sustained year-over-year growth in auto sales since the 1920s, according to <a href=\"http://www.autoalliance.org/auto-marketplace/sales-data\">Auto Alliance</a>, a vehicle manufacturer association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vehicle sales wax and wane with the economy.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wardsauto.com/datasheet/us-car-and-truck-sales-1931-2014\">Wards Auto</a>, an analytics organization, has tracked vehicle sales since 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/psXJvJMLMjai_bPoU3shR7wJonI0QryGoEjiUfRclsv4fLDVK0tTmWJp-IAccomY1-LRqA-vc3kMjALkm29xuBIXsniAUbKHxkhhKdlP7eZWNbtHpiUmmafKDfgImPikSc85OfjL\" style=\"border:none; height:374px; width:583px\" title=\"Vehicles sold annually\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When times are tough, vehicles become a discretionary purchase that consumers are willing to put off. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-car-sales-hit-record-high-in-2015/2016/01/05/363aaf30-af14-11e5-b820-eea4d64be2a1_story.html\">Analysts believe</a> car sales have done so well in the past couple of years because of a combination of the improving economy, cheap gas prices, available credit and low interest rates for loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we asked agreed with Clinton&rsquo;s claim, saying the sales figures are a reasonable way to measure the auto industry&rsquo;s health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; said Bruce Belzowski, managing director of the automotive futures group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. &quot;By any objective measure, the auto industry bailout is an Obama success story.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Detroit Three big automakers &mdash; Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2016/01/05/fca-sales-rose-13-2015-record-year-autos/78268882/\">reported strong sales</a> in 2015 and projections for 2016. But it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the record-breaking total vehicle sales figure isn&rsquo;t just for American-made cars. <a href=\"http://blog.caranddriver.com/boom-we-look-back-at-2015-u-s-auto-sales-the-best-year-ever/\">It includes foreign models sold in the United States, too</a>. Of the 2.4 million cars sold so far in 2016, 71 percent were imports, according to the<em> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-autosales.html\">Wall Street Journal.</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Lewis, a professor emeritus of business history at the University of Michigan, compared 2015 to the golden age of the American car industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Think of 1955, a record sales year, and a time in which well over 90 percent of the vehicles sold in the U.S. were manufactured by American companies,&quot; Lewis said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even taking into account the number of foreign versus American car purchases, Clinton&rsquo;s claim is reasonable because foreign car sales count as part of the &quot;auto industry,&quot; said Clifford Winston, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. Foreign cars have been a growing part of the U.S. auto market since the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it might not be fair to take her claim as proof of the long-term health of American manufacturers, Winston said. While the bailout resurrected struggling American auto manufacturers, it&rsquo;s possible that it just stalled the companies&rsquo; eventual decline as consumers choose foreign cars instead. He also noted potential future threats from ride-sharing services and self-driving cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let us not get too excited about one or even a few years of successes with this industry that has been extremely turbulent and repeatedly rescued by the government,&quot; Winston said. &quot;All the while, the Detroit share has gone down. So that tells you something that any given year still may mask long-term issues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is partially reflected in employment data. Employment among car dealers has in fact returned to its pre-recession high of about 1.2 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But employment in the motor vehicle and parts manufacturing sector hasn&rsquo;t completely recovered. About 1.3 million people worked in this sector in the early 2000s; that figure dropped to about 620,000 at the height of the recession in 2009, and it has risen to about 920,000 in early 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But &quot;for the factories that made it out of the recession, all is well,&quot; Belzowski said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. vehicle production in 2015 was the eighth-largest in history, at 11.9 million. That&rsquo;s high &mdash; and almost double production in 2009 &mdash; but still not quite as high as it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-car-sales-poised-for-their-best-month-ever-1451999939\">Some industry analysts</a> expect the good times to keep coming for the next few years, with 2016 breaking more records, according to the <em><a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2016/01/05/fca-sales-rose-13-2015-record-year-autos/78268882/\">Detroit Free Press</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a great time to be in the automobile business, and it&rsquo;s particularly sweet for those who lived through the dark days of 2009 and 2010,&quot; said IHS Automotive analyst Tom Libby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With sales figures that exceed the pre-recession high, 2015 was a great year for the auto industry, including American manufacturers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This high point should be taken with a grain of salt because it might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers&rsquo; growing market share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s statement is nearly accurate but requires that extra bit of context, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5d3ea8b7-e3b8-41e8-b56a-b7ce4d6745cb\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5d3ea8b7-e3b8-41e8-b56a-b7ce4d6745cb</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-20T13:00:00.652025", "ruling_date": "2016-05-20T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says 2015 was the best year in US auto industry history", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-2015-was-best-year-us-auto-in", "ruling_link_text": "Sales go beyond pre-recession high", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wards Auto, &quot;<a href=\"http://wardsauto.com/datasheet/us-car-and-truck-sales-1931-2014\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. Car and Truck Sales, 1931-2015</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Auto Alliance, <a href=\"http://www.autoalliance.org/auto-marketplace/sales-data\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sales Data</u></a>, accessed May 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iagauto.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Automotive Industry: Employment, Earnings, and Hours,</u></a>&quot; May 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Car and Driver, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.caranddriver.com/boom-we-look-back-at-2015-u-s-auto-sales-the-best-year-ever/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Boom!
