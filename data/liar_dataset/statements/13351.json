The conservative political advocacy group even puts a precise number on that claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He voted time and again to make life more expensive for families in Wisconsin,&quot; the narrator says in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VULvLa8TMPc\">ad, released in August</a>. &quot;Russ voted over 250 times to raise taxes &mdash; 250.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Club for Growth, another conservative group, used the same figure in an<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO_aFujxT7E\"> ad released Oct. 12, 2016</a>, wording it as &quot;250 votes for higher taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Feingold really cast that many votes to raise taxes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The matter isn&rsquo;t as straightforward as the nice round number leads viewers to believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Disagreement over budget votes</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">When asked for backup, Americans for Prosperity, founded by billionaire businessman and activist David Koch, provided a list of 264 votes dating back to Feingold&rsquo;s 1993 debut in the U.S. Senate. We did our own research and also sent the list to Feingold&rsquo;s campaign for feedback.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundational question is what constitutes a vote to &quot;raise taxes&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than half the votes cited in the ad &mdash; 150 &mdash; came on budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. They are used as blueprints for the budget or in some cases to make a political statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But PolitiFact<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/15/john-mccain/mccains-aim-still-off-on-tax-votes/\"> has</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/08/john-mccain/obama-voted-for-budget-resolution-not-taxes-/\"> noted</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/14/john-mccain/the-budget-resolution-isnt-that-clear/\"> repeatedly</a> that it is inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The resolutions often don&rsquo;t include precise details and don&rsquo;t on their own raise, lower or even keep taxes the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re voting for kind of an overall map and taking multiple votes on that same map, and not directly raising or lowering taxes in a piece of legislation,&quot; said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans for Prosperity contends the votes are a fair addition to the tally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Although many of the spending and revenue levels set in budget resolutions require additional legislative action to implement, there are a number of spending and tax policies set by budget resolutions,&quot; said James Fellinger, a spokesman for the group. &quot;Budget resolutions enact procedural changes in order to ease the passage of those policies &mdash; voting for a budget resolution is plainly supporting the policies it outlines.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad&rsquo;s tally also includes many votes that were actually against tax cuts &mdash; not in favor of tax increases. Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said Feingold campaign counted more than 150 such examples among the votes cited by Americans for Prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not merely a semantic distinction. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a nearly identical<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/nov/01/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-voted-higher-taxes-27/\"> claim</a> about votes to raise taxes, three federal budget experts generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut isn&rsquo;t the same as a vote for a tax increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gordon said that element of the ad&rsquo;s claim &quot;is probably the worst argument of all of them&quot; from a fiscal policy perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The voter reading that is going to believe (Feingold) voted in 250 separate times to raise an individual&rsquo;s own income tax,&quot; Gordon said. &quot;By any standard that sort of accounting is false in terms of what we expect the average voter to take away from the (claim).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A counting question</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, there is another problem:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Americans for Prosperity cited 264 separate votes from Feingold, they came on only 65 pieces of legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The votes came on amendments that varied widely in content and scope, so each represented a different position. Nevertheless, that counting approach inflates the total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Feingold cast 34 votes on<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-concurrent-resolution/23\"> Senate Concurrent Resolution 23</a> in 2003, which established Congress&rsquo; version of the budget for the following year. Each vote took a position on a proposed change of some kind, but should that count as 34 votes or one?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Counting multiple votes on the same legislation and all of its permutations just serves to pad the number, but in some cases isn&rsquo;t completely inaccurate, just not telling the full tale,&quot; Steve Ellis, vice president of<a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/\"> Taxpayers for Common Sense</a>, told PolitiFact Florida in 2012 when it tackled and rated a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/nov/01/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-voted-higher-taxes-27/\">similar item</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with the 250 tally: some of the votes come on nuanced, multi-part amendments that are not easily categorized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example is the<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4872/text\"> Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010</a>, companion legislation to the Affordable Care Act that helped established Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold cast three votes on March 24, 2010, against amendments that would exempt certain devices from a 2.3 percent tax (in effect, voting to raise a tax). But the amendment would have offset that by lowering the law&rsquo;s affordability tax exemption for individuals (voting to lower a tax).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the offsetting effect, Americans for Prosperity lists it as a tax increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans for Prosperity says Feingold voted more than 250 times to raise taxes as a U.S. senator, contending any vote in support of a higher tax should be part of that tally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that number is built on assumptions and simplifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Feingold cast tax-related votes that many times, more than half of those came on non-binding resolutions that took a position in favor of raising taxes but did not raise taxes by themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim also does not account for the large number of votes that were actually against a tax cut, not in favor of a tax increase. Experts say that&rsquo;s a big difference. And it doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge the nuanced nature of the votes themselves or that many votes came on elements of the same legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the ad&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8aecd592-a350-4255-97a3-e1210795a4a1\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8aecd592-a350-4255-97a3-e1210795a4a1</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-26T10:57:27.063435", "ruling_date": "2016-10-27T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Americans for Prosperity falsely claims 250 tax increases from Russ Feingold", "ruling_headline_slug": "americans-prosperity-falsely-claims-250-tax-increa", "ruling_link_text": "Among the problems: A vote against a cut is not an increase", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, Americans for Prosperity, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VULvLa8TMPc\">We know Russ Feingold</a>,&quot;
