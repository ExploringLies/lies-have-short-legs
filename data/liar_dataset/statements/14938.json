He told us that &quot;even under the most favorable assumptions, it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely&quot; that Friedrich Trump would have amassed the minimum of 30 points just to be considered for immigration.

She told us that before Friedrich immigrated, he had little, if any English-speaking skills; almost certainly had not finished high school; having trained as a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/an-immigrant-named-trump\">barber&rsquo;s apprentice</a>, almost certainly would not have had a high-paying job awaiting him in New York; and, coming from a low-income family, almost certainly would not have had a large sum of money to invest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the first lady, the case is not overly favorable, but also not clear cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wife Melania Trump</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce&rsquo;s campaign pointed us to a San Jose (Calif.) <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/09/melania-trump-wouldnt-pass-her-husbands-merit-based-immigration-test/\">Mercury News article</a>. It declared that if RAISE were in place when <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/melania-trump/\">Melania Trump</a> arrived with a temporary visa &quot;she wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance of being able to stay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Mercury News: Melania, a native of Slovenia, first came to the United States, at age 26, on a tourist visa in August 1996. A few months later, she obtained an H-1B visa for skilled workers. There&rsquo;s some question about whether she did some modeling work before getting her H-1B visa as well as how she obtained a green card in 2001. She married Trump in 2006 and became a U.S. citizen. &quot;At best, Melania could probably score about 21 points, so there would be no visa for her,&quot; the article said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She did have more going for her than Friedrich did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>English:</strong> Melania currently speaks English with a heavy accent, but it&rsquo;s one of five languages she&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/09/20/melania-trump-photo-billboard-english/\">reportedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/melania-trump-learn-a-little-bit-of-english/\">fluent in</a>. There&rsquo;s no way to know, at the time she came to the United States, whether her English-speaking skills would have earned her zero points, 12, or some number in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Education:</strong> Melania briefly studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. But, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/donald-melania-trump-marriage\">according to Vanity Fair</a>, she dropped out after winning runner-up in a beauty contest. So, for a high school diploma or the equivalent, that&rsquo;s one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Job awaiting:</strong> At age 18, in Milan, Italy, Melania signed on with a modeling agency that said it sponsored the visa that brought her to New York in 1996. In New York in 1996, Melania would have needed a starting salary of at least $53,100 to earn any points, according to Cohen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Means: </strong>Another unknown is whether Melania could have brought along a large sum of money, even if that seems unlikely. Melania&rsquo;s father managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, and her mother was either a fashion designer or a garment factory worker, according to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/08/16/melania-trump-would-be-a-first-lady-for-the-ages/\">the New York Post</a>. She would have earned points if she could have come over with the current equivalent of more than $1.35 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legomsky, the Washington University law professor, pointed out that even if Melania amassed 30 points, which he said was unlikely, it would be difficult for her to be chosen for immigration given that more applicants would have much higher scores. But he said he could not say for certain. Syracuse&rsquo;s Cohen said Melania &quot;probably would have come close&quot; to hitting 30 points, and potentially could have exceeded 30, depending on her English proficiency and the salary of her first job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House responded to our request seeking information about Bryce&rsquo;s claim, but did not provide any information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce says that under Donald Trump&rsquo;s &quot;own legislation,&quot; Trump&#39;s &quot;own family would not have been allowed into the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems unlikely, perhaps highly unlikely, that either Trump&rsquo;s grandfather or his wife would have earned enough points under the legislation to be eligible for immigration. But, particularly with Melania Trump, it can&rsquo;t be known for certain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Half True.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-18T16:37:16.160847", "ruling_date": "2018-01-19T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Would Trump bill have kept his grandfather and Melania from immigrating to U.S.?
