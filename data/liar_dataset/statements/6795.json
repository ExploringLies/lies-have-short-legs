The Congressional Budget Office said it <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/24884\">could top $350 billion.</a> But the payback was higher than expected, which former President Bill Clinton mentioned during an interview on <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-20-2012/exclusive---bill-clinton-extended-interview-pt--1\"><em>The Daily Show</em>. </a>Describing the atmosphere at the height of the financial crisis, Clinton said, &quot;Everybody was all hands on deck and they did a lot of things, including the unpopular TARP bill to keep us from falling into a depression. By the way, you have gotten the TARP money back plus a profit.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is something the former president has said <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-16-2010/exclusive---bill-clinton-extended-interview-pt--1\">before</a>, so we decided to see if it is correct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt isn&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The point about coming out ahead is wrong ,&quot; said Paul Kiel who has covered the bailout for the investigative news site <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/\">ProPublica</a>. &quot;But TARP won&rsquo;t be as much in the hole as people feared.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClinton is right only if you look just at the money that went to banks. According to the latest update from the <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/Daily%20TARP%20Update%20-%2009.26.2012.pdf\">Treasury Department</a>, $245 billion went out the door to banks and $266 billion came back. The $21 billion gain came from dividends and gains when Washington sold the shares it held.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut TARP went beyond banks. The government put $80 billion into General Motors, Chrysler and GM&rsquo;s financial subsidiary, GMAC. Another $68 billion went to the insurance company, American International Group, AIG. On a much smaller scale, $5 billion has been used to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages and other housing market assistance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is where Clinton&rsquo;s statement goes off track. The government still has plenty of money tied up in GM, GMAC and AIG. Between the three, taxpayers are looking at about $57 billion outstanding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you account for the profit made on the banking side, TARP is $34 billion in the hole.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat is a fraction, about 10 percent, of the original estimate. Where TARP ends up is of course a matter of educated guesswork, but most analysts expect the loss to decline further. In March, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the total lifetime cost would be $32 billion. Kiel thinks it could drop below $20 billion. Kiel is bullish on AIG.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It&rsquo;s extremely likely that all the AIG money will come back,&quot; Kiel said, &quot;and it could even be positive.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2010, Congress capped the program at $475 billion. Looking ahead, the greatest uncertainty lies with the <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/housing/pages/default.aspx\">housing foreclosure program </a>within TARP. The government has barely dipped into the $45 billion available and there&rsquo;s over a year left for people to apply. Whatever is spent will not be repaid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFormer President Clinton said government got the TARP money back plus interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat is correct for the money that went to banks. It is incorrect for TARP as a whole. The program remains about $34 billion in the red.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-28T10:43:24.155990", "ruling_date": "2012-09-28T10:42:04", "ruling_headline": "Bill Clinton says TARP turned a profit", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-clinton-says-tarp-turned-profit", "ruling_link_text": "Yes for banks, no for AIG and GM", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Daily Show,<a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-20-2012/exclusive---bill-clinton-extended-interview-pt--1\"> Bill Clinton - extended interview</a>, September 20, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Daily Show, <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-september-16-2010/exclusive---bill-clinton-extended-interview-pt--1\">Bill Clinton -extended interview</a>, September 16, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProPublica,<a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/\"> Bailout Tracke</a>r, September 26, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterview with Paul Kiel, reporter, ProPublica, September 27, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/Daily%20TARP%20Update%20-%2009.26.2012.pdf\">Daily TARP update</a>, September 26, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Department of the Treasury,<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/August%202012%20Monthly%20Report.pdf\"> Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP): Monthly Report to</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/August%202012%20Monthly%20Report.pdf\">Congress</a>, August 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCongressional Budget Office,<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-28-2012TARP.pdf\"> Report on the Troubled Asset Relief Program</a>, March 28, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/24884\">Troubled Asset Relief Program</a>, April 17, 2009<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/housing/pages/default.aspx\">TARP Housing Program</a>, July 13, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.C.
