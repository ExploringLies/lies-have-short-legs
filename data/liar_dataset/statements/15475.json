The way the Viral WDC story is written suggests that 1,600 would not have been apprehended if the National Guard wasn&rsquo;t assisting. But there&rsquo;s no evidence to support that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN said a CBP official &quot;did not have comparison numbers available, so it was not possible to determine if those figures were substantially more than if National Guard troops had not been dispatched to the border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total apprehensions were up in April compared to March, but border apprehensions have been <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration\">increasing</a> since February. There were about 37,400 southwest border apprehensions in March, compared to approximately 38,300 in April, according to CBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Donald Trump on April 4 issued a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-attorney-general-secretary-homeland-security/\">memorandum</a> so that the National Guard could help immigration officials stop the illegal entry of immigrants and illicit drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the National Guard is not actually apprehending individuals. Instead, they are carrying out <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/national-guard-continues-provide-invaluable-support-laredo-sector\">non-enforcement roles</a>, serving as pilots, aerial observers, intelligence analysts, communications specialists, camera operators and vehicle mechanics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Secretary James N.
