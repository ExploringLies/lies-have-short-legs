There are only <a href=\"http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure\">13</a> <a href=\"http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure/about-us-courts-appeals\">appellate courts</a> below the U.S. Supreme Court &mdash; 12 Circuit Courts of Appeals and the Federal Circuit Court. And there is no Judge Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the story claims that a judge &quot;allowed two critical and violent tenets of Sharia Law&quot; to be practiced in the United States and that Trump used his executive power to remove him from the bench.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the story and how separated it is from reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When asked why the feds have the right to allow a man to brutalize his wife for speaking with another man and to beat her nearly to death if she were to act on her impulses, the judge mentioned the systematic infusion clause and said the Sharia Law should be allowed because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states,&quot; the story claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/fact-check-did-trump-fire-a-muslim-judge-for-trying-to-impose-sharia/article/2011762\">fellow</a><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/muslim-federal-judge-sharia/\"> fact-checkers</a> <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/no-legalization-sharia-law/\">have noted</a>, there is no &quot;systematic infusion clause,&quot; and the <a href=\"https://www.usconstitution.net/const.pdf\">14th Amendment</a> largely deals with citizenship rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Trump used an old precedent and an executive order to remove al Allalawaralahali-Smith from the bench, citing gross negligence of his duties and wanton disregard for the United States Constitution, reports As American As Apple Pie,&quot; the story continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the website <a href=\"http://asamericanasapplepie.org/about/\">asamericanasapplepie.org</a> is not a source of accurate news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That website&rsquo;s About page claims everything posted on its site is fiction. &quot;It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site&rsquo;s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Webviners.com&rsquo;s story also uses different names for the supposed judge, at times calling him &quot;Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith,&quot; &quot;al Allalawaralahali-Smith&quot; and &quot;Alallaha-Smith.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Feb. 28 post is a variation of other <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/no-legalization-sharia-law/\">stories debunked</a> in 2017. Previous fake news posts claimed it was &quot;Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith&quot; who ruled in favor of Sharia law in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Texas <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2017/nov/28/sid-miller-admits-posting-false-account-donald-tru/\">reported</a> that in November 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MillerForTexas/posts/2136281246594035\">Facebook page for Sid Miller</a>, the Texas agriculture commissioner, shared a post from a website called trumpsolidsupporters.me, which made the same fake news claims as webviners.com did in February 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The link to trumpsolidsupporters.me remains on Miller&rsquo;s Facebook page, yet an amended description for the link says: &quot;Well it looks like I may have been duped. This may be fake news, but I still think Sharia law has no place in the United States of America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A webviners.com post claimed Trump removed a Muslim federal judge for trying to implement Sharia law in the United States.
