You once told a contestant on <em>The Celebrity Apprentice</em> it would be a &lsquo;pretty picture&rsquo; to see her on her knees.

And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the &#39;war on women&#39;?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, who owned up only to insulting comedian Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/08/08/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-blood-lemon-intv-ctn.cnn\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>disparaged</u></a>&nbsp;Kelly after the debate &mdash; saying that she &quot;behaved very badly,&quot; that&nbsp;&quot;she had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,&quot; and sharing a Twitter post that referred to her as a&nbsp;&quot;<u><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/629553612839124992\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-decoration: none;\">bimbo</a></u><u>&quot;&nbsp;&mdash;</u>&nbsp;only inflaming debate about whether he is a misogynistic <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/09/heather-mcghee/republican-presidential-nominee-hasnt-won-over-wom/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>threat to the GOP</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC host Chuck Todd tried to get Trump to understand why his comments are perceived as sexist, bringing up <em>New York Times </em>columnist Gail Collins and singer Bette Midler as two more examples of times he went after a woman&rsquo;s &quot;looks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, some of the things that she said, I didn&#39;t say, okay?&quot; Trump said of Kelly. &quot;And she went through a whole list. And this is a hell of a first question, by the way. But I will say this, I was attacked by the people that you talk about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact-check whether Kelly said things that Trump didn&rsquo;t say and look at the context of some of his other arguments with high-profile women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson for Trump&rsquo;s campaign could not be reached for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Fat pig,&rsquo; &lsquo;slob&rsquo; and &lsquo;animal&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly said Trump had referred to women as &quot;fat pigs&quot; and &quot;slobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he admitted during the debate, Trump has leveled both invectives at O&rsquo;Donnell, the comedian and former panelist on <em>The View</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He rattled off the first in a Dec. 29, 2006, interview with Fox News while imagining how O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s ex-wife Kelli might have explained the couple&rsquo;s relationship to her parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Can you imagine the parents of Kelli ... when she said, &#39;Mom, Dad, I just fell in love with a big, fat pig named Rosie?&rsquo; &quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also referred to O&rsquo;Donnell as an &quot;<a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20005320,00.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>animal</u></a>&quot; and a &quot;<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2006/12/21/rosie_odonnell_1.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>slob</u></a>&quot; in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the insults clearly happened, apparently spurred by comments O&rsquo;Donnell made on the Dec. 20, 2006, episode of <em>The View</em>. After Trump announced he would <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/12/19/trump-decides-not-to-fire-miss-usa-tara-conner.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>not fire</u></a> a Miss USA winner who had been accused of drug use, underage drinking and &quot;sexual indiscretions,&quot; O&rsquo;Donnell criticized Trump&rsquo;s personal and professional dealings, pointing out that a few of Trump&rsquo;s companies had gone bankrupt in the past and calling him a &quot;snake-oil salesman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Donnell also lamented Trump&rsquo;s appearance as the &quot;moral authority&quot; in the scandal, pointing to his two divorces as evidence that he should not be considered &quot;a model for the nation&rsquo;s 20-year-olds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Dogs&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly said Trump called women &quot;dogs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One incident, as Todd brought up, refers to an insult he allegedly directed at Gail Collins, a liberal op-ed columnist for the <em>New York Times</em> who had interviewed Trump during his early years as a developer. In a 2011 <em>Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/opinion/02collins.html?src=twrhp&amp;_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>column</u></a>, Collins wrote, &quot;He is extremely sensitive to any gibes about his business record, which has been up and down over the years. During one down period, I referred to him in print as a &lsquo;financially embattled thousandaire,&rsquo; and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and &lsquo;The Face of a Dog!&rsquo; written over it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could not independently verify Collins&rsquo; claim, or dig up her original story from a &quot;down period&quot; for Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump directed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/585281558816370690\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>similar language</u></a> at Arianna Huffington on Twitter in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"donaldtrumparianna.jpg\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4WBGumcoOgApVb__VKfzJuYm2lz4DWJTKTWpa3XvE9gaccd53fkVA5w8oVKJrxsDDxTHreVyMp6zCXGkJ3irqLTVid8K3eimrh22R823CrBywD4JslK7Y_Yau7Av4PpveFYpvIzJ\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:257px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:445px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Disgusting&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly also referenced Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/us/politics/depositions-show-donald-trump-as-quick-to-exaggerate-and-insult.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>treatment of a lawyer</u></a> during a lawsuit involving one of his Florida developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2011 lawsuit, Elizabeth Beck, a lawyer representing Trump&rsquo;s opponents, asked for a medical break, saying she had to pump breast milk for her 3-month-old daughter. But Trump objected, calling Beck &quot;disgusting&quot; when she took out the pump. Trump left the deposition, halting the day&rsquo;s proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump once traded barbs with the singer and actress Bette Midler, as Todd pointed out on <em>Meet the Press</em>. In 2012, Midler tweeted about Trump: &quot;The man who has ruined New York seeks to ruin the nation.&quot; Midler deleted the tweet, but later referred to him as &quot;stupid&quot; and called his hairstyle a &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/261936460167520256\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>terrible dye job someone talked him into</u></a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump replied by calling Midler &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/262583273681735680\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>disgusting</u></a>,&quot; as well as &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/262582937072058369\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>grotesque</u></a>,&quot; &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/262583859709882369\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>ugly</u></a>,&quot; and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/262583231893889024\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a bad singer</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could not find documentation of an exact time he said &quot;disgusting animal,&quot; but he has certainly used both words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Celebrity Apprentice</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another remark came in 2013 during an episode of Trump&rsquo;s reality show, <em>The Celebrity Apprentice</em>. During a judging session with Trump, former rocker Bret Michaels described a female contestant, Playboy playmate Brande Roderick, as &quot;falling to her knees&quot; and begging not to be fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Trump said. &quot;You dropped to your knees?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Roderick said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2015/08/07/watch-trump-s-ugly-drop-to-your-knees-comment.html\">Trump said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"brandescreenshot.jpg\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3Cex1leWxbmPZJR1myNgqHRYqxbYSSDRqQG9eLN69X2q-go3Y8yTIkwa_n5Y8Y1X2v5FILdWy6ffy6-S6gXEKSIyBkIqSnsIYDvh5GIpIO8RmtKJPm2EcUHixDio69iHPCgG1moc\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:262px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:431px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that &quot;he didn&rsquo;t say&quot; some of the things about women that Kelly talked about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The record, however, shows the opposite is true.
