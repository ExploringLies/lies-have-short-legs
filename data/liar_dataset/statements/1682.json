Jon Kyl's staff and more information about the Yuma Sun  report. We have updated this item on April 13 to fully reflect the new information.  The ruling, however, remains the same -- False.</em></p>\r\n<p>What Sen. Jon Kyl did or  didn't say about immigration at a town hall in Yuma, Ariz., was in  dispute on ABC News' <em>This Week</em>.<br /><br /> Host Jake Tapper asked  Kyl, \"You helped lead the cause of immigration reform in 2007. Senate  Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he is going to bring up immigration  reform. You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will  use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the  filibuster of immigration reform?\"<br /><br /> \"I don't think I said that,  Jake, but what I did say is that the conditions for immigration reform  no longer exist,\" Kyl said. \"The consensus that existed before does not  exist. And among other reasons, because the administration -- this  current administration has not done what's necessary to secure the  border and enforce the law. We just saw the tragic death of a rancher  down on the border, presumably from drug smugglers or illegal  immigrants, that simply illustrates once again the fact that we have not  controlled the border. And until that's done, I think it's going to be  very difficult for Congress to support legislation that would be as  comprehensive as that I supported three years ago.\"<br /><br /> The answer  indicates Kyl is not optimistic about immigration reform, but we wanted  to find out whether Kyl said Republicans would filibuster or not.<br /><br /> Kyl made his remarks at a town hall attended by 350 people in Yuma,  Ariz., on April 7, according to a report in the<em> Yuma Sun</em>, a daily  newspaper owned by Freedom Communications. The newspaper reported the  filibuster remark, though very briefly. Here's what the <a href=\"http://www.yumasun.com/news/kyl-57575-government-little.html\" target=\"_blank\">paper's report</a> said:<br /><br /><em>One man in the  audience asked Kyl about the GOP's strategy to curtail the efforts of  the Democrat-controlled Congress and executive branch.<br /><br /> \"First of  all, our strategy on health care included taking as long as we possibly  could so the American people could clearly understand (it).. and it  took a year for it to get done,\" Kyl said, adding they will do their  best to slow up any other bills, like immigration reform, in the same  manner.<br /><br /> \"My guess is (immigration reform) won't have the votes  to pass, but political promises have been made to key constituency of  the party that is in power. Republicans will use the opportunity to  filibuster...\"</em><br /><br /> Kyl's remarks did not go unnoticed. <a href=\"http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/04/09/kyl-immigration-reform/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wonk Room</a>, a liberal blog run by the Center for  American Progress Action Fund, linked to the<em> Sun's</em> report and  noted that Kyl's remarks were \"the first time a high-ranking GOP member  has threatened to block reform entirely.\"<br /><br /> Tapper's question --  \"You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the  opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of  immigration reform?\" -- was a verbatim repeat of the quote the <em>Sun</em> reported.</p>\r\n<p>But the <em>Sun</em>'s quotation of Kyl --  \"Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster\" -- is a little off.</p>\r\n<p>Kyl's  staff provided us with a transcript and video; they said it showed more  context for Kyl's statement. We reviewed the material; here's an  extended version of Kyl remarks.</p>\r\n<p>\"My guess is, neither  (card check and immigration reform) will have the votes to pass. But  because political promises have been made to key constituency of the  party that is in power, that they're going to do something about these  problems, they will bring up very partisan legislation. Republicans  will, primarily Republicans, will vote it down, that is to say we will  prevent it from coming up through the filibuster, through requiring  cloture and they won't get 60 votes. And then they&rsquo;ll be able to blame  us for being anti-union or anti-Hispanic or whatever. It's false, but  that&rsquo;s the political game. But at least those things won't pass.\"</p>\r\n<p>On  April 13, the <em>Yuma Sun</em> said it would run a correction on the  quote. But Tapper's summary of the misquote is still a fair account of  what Kyl said. And of course, there are no quote marks on broadcast  television. If anything, the video makes a stronger case that Kyl  believes Republicans will filibuster immigration reform, which was the  premise of Tapper's question.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kyl's staff told us he only meant  that Republicans would filibuster a purely partisan bill, not the kind  of bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that Kyl put forward  with Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2007. That's why Kyl objected to Tapper's  premise. <br /><br />Still, Tapper's question -- \"You said the other day in  Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster.  Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?\" --  remains an fair summary (though not a quotation) of Kyl's town hall  remarks. The video showed that Kyl predicted a Republican  filibuster. So Kyl's statement -- that he didn't say Republicans will  use the opportunity to filibuster -- is False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-12T17:15:41.721528", "ruling_date": "2010-04-12T17:22:45", "ruling_headline": "Yuma's daily newspaper quoted Kyl saying Republicans would filibuster", "ruling_headline_slug": "yuma-daily-newspaper-quoted-kyl-saying-republican", "ruling_link_text": "UPDATE: Now with video", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/supreme-court-vacancy-10344589\" target=\"_blank\">Supreme Court Vacancy: Sen.
