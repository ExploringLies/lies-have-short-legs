We never say &lsquo;working man.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few statistics in that passage, but we wanted to hone in on one of them: that women are the primary earners in 40 percent of American households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the notes section of her book, Trump referenced a widely cited <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/\">2013 Pew Research Center report</a> that looked at households with children under the age of 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hmOx9QlqUQg6gujl6gBifpey6jKwv1Ddg7uKSl6HtNH79G0VqN2B_Q4YjSJe-uvligCevqHsSniXWCXwzImKZ6IYYXioxZiZ5Eyd2O9JK2vbf29OsRtPDTTcuyO3NZpEF2K0ylsu\" style=\"border:none; float:left; height:446px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; width:296px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report found that in 2011, women earned most or all of the family&rsquo;s income in 40 percent of these households, adding up to about 13.7 million &quot;breadwinner moms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s quadruple what it was in 1960 &mdash; 11 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pew figure is a little more specific than what Trump wrote because it only looked at households that had kids, not those that don&#39;t have kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in context, it&#39;s clear Trump was referring to&nbsp;the Pew report &mdash;&nbsp;especially because she referred to the same statistic later in the book when talking about being a working mom herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As much as motherhood is a joy to so many of us, it is also the greatest predictor of wage inequality between men and women in our country,&quot; she wrote.&nbsp;&quot;Forty-seven percent of the U.S. labor force is female; 40 percent of women are their family&#39;s primary breadwinner.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fact is correct,&quot; said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan and former chief economist at the U.S. Labor Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&#39;t find any comprehensive data that spoke to how many households total,&nbsp;including those without kids, had women as the primary earners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the families where the woman is the primary breadwinner, Pew found that 37 percent are married women who earn more than their husbands, while 63 percent are single mothers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the households with a married primary breadwinner, with a median family income of $80,000, are wealthier than the single mother households, which have a median family income of $23,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pew report is the most recent independent report we could find speaking to this issue. But we also came across a <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2016/12/19/295203/breadwinning-mothers-are-increasingly-the-u-s-norm/\">2016 report by the liberal Center for American Progress</a> that had similar findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Center for American Progress, 42 percent of mothers were the sole or primary breadwinners in their households in 2015. And 22.4 percent were co-breadwinners, earning one-quarter to one-half of their total household income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though women&rsquo;s share of the labor force <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/08/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-has-it-wrong-meet-press-labor-parti/\">grew dramatically</a> throughout the latter half of the 20th century, it has stagnated in recent years, at least in part because of a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23469738?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">lack of family-friendly labor policies</a>, said Casey Schoeneberger, communications director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ivanka Trump said, &quot;40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A widely cited Pew report found that in 2011, 40 percent of American households with children under 18 had women providing most or all of the family&rsquo;s income.
