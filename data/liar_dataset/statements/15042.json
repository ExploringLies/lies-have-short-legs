Florida politicians tried to ban doctors from asking abuse victims if there&#39;s a gun in the home. Florida is awash in assault weapons. Want to know why? Ask Marion Hammer and the NRA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first &quot;stand your ground&quot; law was passed in Florida in 2005, but we wondered about Florida&rsquo;s gun ownership rate that Reid cited.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Reid&rsquo;s claim about gun ownership is accurate, based on a study that used 2013 survey. But that study is chock-full of caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">2013 survey data backs up Reid&rsquo;s point</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://sites.bu.edu/tec/files/2017/09/Gun-ownership-and-social-gun-culture..pdf\">brief report</a> by Injury Prevention, an international peer-reviewed journal, the gun ownership rate in Florida in 2013 was 32.5 percent, the same as the one-third figure Reid cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study, led by former Columbia University public health researcher Bindu Kalesan, extrapolated its numbers from a nationally representative survey of 4,000 people in 2013, that were 18 years or older.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kalesan, now a&nbsp;professor at Boston University School of Medicine &amp; Boston School of Public Health, told PolitiFact Florida that Reid&rsquo;s claim is accurate based on the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study also found that roughly one-third of the nation owns guns, about 29.1 percent. By state, gun ownership varied considerably, from 5.2 percent in Delaware to 61.7 percent in Alaska.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida is not an outlier when it comes to gun ownership, based on this study. For example, it showed Texas&nbsp;ownership at 35.9 percent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ran the survey by a few experts to get their take on its findings. The biggest complaint was that the survey wasn&rsquo;t large enough to establish state-based numbers with certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The survey is not representative of state ownership,&quot; said Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University. &quot;The researchers applied the data to the states even though the source of the data cautioned people not to do that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miller and David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard&rsquo;s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the best measurement for gun ownership in Florida comes from the early 2000s. The Centers for Disease Control&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html\">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</a> asked health-related questions to hundreds of thousands of people each year. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were gun questions on the 2001, 2002, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf-ques/2004brfss.pdf\">2004</a> national questionnaire. Hemenway said in <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677232#b24\">2001</a>, 24.5 percent of Floridians said they had a gun in the home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting we also found research on the national level from a June 2017 Pew Research Center <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/\">survey</a>, which found three in 10 U.S. adults said they own a gun, and an additional 36 percent say that &quot;while they don&rsquo;t own one now, they might be open to owning a gun in the future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the Injury Prevention study, the sample size for the study was around 4,000 respondents, but it was not extrapolated to a state level. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Reid said, &quot;One-third of Floridians own guns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reid&rsquo;s claim is accurate based on a 2015 survey that showed that 32.5 percent of Floridians owned guns 2013. However, experts said that the national survey data was not meant to&nbsp;represent the state level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, experts agreed there hasn&rsquo;t been any good research on state ownership levels since the early 2000s&nbsp;when it was around 25 percent in Florida. Reid&rsquo;s number seems to be in the ballpark, but it&rsquo;s important for people to know there is some uncertainty.
