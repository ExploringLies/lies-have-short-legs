Sullivan is falsely quoted welcoming Barr to Fox. The story also falsely claimed President Donald Trump tweeted congratulations to Fox for picking up the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsweek <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/roseanne-abc-fox-canceled-twitter-948172\">reported</a> that some <em>Roseanne&nbsp;</em>fans tweeted expressing hope that Fox picks up the show.
