Alan Grayson, D-Orlando.<br /><br />\"Daniel Webster said he's out. Now he says he's in,\" Tagen said in a statement on behalf of the campaign. \"If he flip-flopped on this, will he flip-flop on delivering for the people of our district?\"<br /><br />We've already ruled on a claim from Webster's campaign announcement. In this item, we wanted to see if the Grayson retort that Webster already announced he wasn't running is accurate.<br /><br />Indeed, on Oct. 13, 2009, Webster said he was out. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2009/10/webster-im-not-running-against-grayson.html\" target=\"_blank\">Here's his statement</a>: \"After much prayer and thoughtful consideration, I have decided not to run for the United States House of Representatives, District 8. This has been a very difficult decision for me personally, especially because of the tremendous outpouring of support that has flooded me from all sides. However, in spite of this incredible encouragement, I still have a certain check in my spirit, prompting me to follow a principle that has always served me well: 'When in doubt, don't.'<br /><br />\"I do firmly believe that in every public office there needs to be a resurgence of the basic principles on which this Republic was founded, and a return to our original standards of integrity and character. While I will not be pursuing a place in Congress, I am grateful for the privilege of serving the citizens of Central Florida for 28 years in our state Legislature, and look forward to future opportunities of service.\"<br /><br />Webster told the <em>Orlando Sentinel</em> he originally opted against running because his family wasn't 100 percent behind the idea. Now they are.<br /><br />Grayson's right. Webster once said he wasn't running. Now, he is.
