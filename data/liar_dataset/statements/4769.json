Indeed, the claim suggests the arrests allowed under the bill would be a dramatic change from the status quo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/ab237\">analysis</a> by the state Legislative Reference Bureau doesn&rsquo;t elaborate much on the bill, which was introduced by Rep. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=assembly&amp;district=38\">Joel Kleefisch</a>, R-Oconomowoc, husband of Lt. Gov. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rebecca-kleefisch/\">Rebecca Kleefisch</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Leg+Council+Memo.pdf\">memo</a> from the state <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lc/\">Legislative</a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lc/\"> Council</a>, which provides legal and other research services to the Legislature, said the bill provides law enforcement officers &quot;additional arrest authority&quot; for state civil forfeitures -- non-criminal offenses prohibited by state law. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill is needed mainly for two reasons, said Joel Kleefisch&rsquo;s research assistant, Stephanie Kundert: to provide uniform enforcement around Wisconsin of state forfeitures, which are punishable by a fine; and to protect law enforcement agencies from lawsuits like one filed against the <a href=\"http://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/index.aspx?nid=17\">Brookfield Police </a><a href=\"http://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/index.aspx?nid=17\">Department</a> in suburban Milwaukee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that case, a Milwaukee woman was arrested at gunpoint in July 2010 after attending a Brookfield church service while wearing a holstered handgun. The woman, assisted by the <a href=\"http://www.wisconsincarry.org/default.html#\">Wisconsin </a><a href=\"http://www.wisconsincarry.org/default.html#\">Carry</a> gun-rights group, filed a federal civil rights suit, which the City of Brookfield <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/112841934.html\">settled</a> in January 2011 by paying her $7,500.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne legal claim the woman made was police had no legal authority to arrest her and that helped expose the need for the Kleefisch bill, said Brookfield Assistant Police Chief Dean Collins, who is the main promoter of the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy way of background, Collins, who served more than 30 years in the Milwaukee Police Department, pointed out that state law already gives police the power to make arrests under three sets of circumstances:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor felony and misdemeanor crimes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor local ordinance violations, such as a dog at large.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor traffic offenses, including parking violations or failing to wear a seat belt.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, despite what the John Birch Society claim suggests, a dog at large is already an arrest-able offense in communities that have such an ordinance; and failing to wear a seat belt and parking violations are among traffic violations that already are arrest-able offenses statewide.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, ironically, no state law gives officers the power to enforce state forfeitures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s a void in the law and it was just not noticed for many, many years,&quot; Collins said at an Oct. 19, 2011 <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=7103\">public</a><a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=7103\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=7103\">hearing </a>on the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Kleefisch bill -- <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lc/comtmats/files/ab0237_20111019134400.pdf\">endorsed</a> by state associations that represent Wisconsin&rsquo;s police chiefs, sheriffs and district attorneys -- is needed so officers can enforce state forfeitures, such as the one that prohibits dogs at large, in communities where no such local ordinance exists, Collins said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore importantly, he said, the bill would give legal authority for officers statewide to enforce more serious state forfeitures that are not covered by local ordinances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Collins+letter.docx\">letter</a> to lawmakers, Collins cited a number of offenses many would consider serious:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tElectioneering at a polling place</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIntoxicated or reckless flying of aircraft</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tFelons installing burglar alarms</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tHotel rooms used for underage use of alcohol or drugs</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDisturbance of human graves</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tTransportation of firearms</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tTattooing of children</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe list also include offenses that might be considered less serious: trespassing on private property; sending unsolicited faxes; fireworks violations; body passing at sports events; improper use of laser pointers and refusal to pay bus fare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHaven&rsquo;t police and sheriff&rsquo;s deputies already been enforcing such things?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKundert said many police agencies have been doing so for many years, even though they lack explicit legal authority. Officers investigate a state forfeiture violation and report it to the county district attorney. In turn, the district attorney can file an action in Circuit Court that can result in a person being ordered to pay a fine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCollins predicted that if the Kleefisch bill does not become law, some law enforcement agencies will stop taking action for state forfeitures for fear of being sued like Brookfield was. Wisconsin Carry, which <a href=\"http://wisconsinwarrior.com/?listing=re-reject-assembly-bill-237-pass-this-on\">opposes</a> the bill, says it &quot;vastly expands police authority&quot; and won&rsquo;t legally protect police agencies that make arrests like Brookfield did in the gun case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA final point before we conclude.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCollins stressed that the word <em>arrest</em> has broad meaning in the law. An arrest can involve being handcuffed and put in jail; but legally a person is under arrest just by being detained and questioned by an officer, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe John Birch Society said that under a bill pending in the Legislature, &quot;minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrest-able offenses.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDog at large violations are already arrest-able in communities that have such ordinances and seat belt and parking violations are arrest-able statewide -- though the arrest typically does not involve handcuffs or jail, but rather a person being detained or perhaps ending up with a fine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill would make numerous state forfeitures arrest-able. But that would simply give legal authority for something officers already doing -- detaining and sometimes referring to prosecutors people suspected of violating non-criminal state laws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe John Birch Society statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information.
