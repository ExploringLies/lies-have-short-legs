But he got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired.

But the department decided against it after concluding, separately from the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision, that his behavior didn&rsquo;t endanger kids as defined by the law at that time, spokesman Tom McCarthy told us. In other words, he said, in the department&rsquo;s view there was no legal basis to take away Harris&rsquo; license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That position appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris&rsquo; firing, Walker <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/walker-signs-bill-allowing-dpi-to-revoke-licenses-of-educators/article_6b816628-1609-11e1-a290-001cc4c002e0.html\">signed a measure</a> that <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/lcactmemo/act084.pdf\">redefined immoral conduct</a> to include &quot;the intentional use of an educational agency&rsquo;s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, the new law, <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/public_hearing_records/sc_education/bills_resolutions/11hr_sc_ed_sb0049_pt01.pdf\">which Evers supported</a> and which was <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/walker-signs-bill-allowing-dpi-to-revoke-licenses-of-educators/article_6b816628-1609-11e1-a290-001cc4c002e0.html\">prompted partly</a> by the Harris case, specifies that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation -- and that there doesn&rsquo;t have to be any endangerment of kids. The old law didn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the GOP argues that there was one important fact Evers had that the arbitrator didn&rsquo;t: After there was outcry from parents about Harris&rsquo; return, the school district allowed students to attend a study hall if they didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable in Harris&rsquo; class. The GOP says that endangered students&rsquo; education, since they were missing valuable instruction time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, McCarthy told us that the law allows the state to revoke a teacher&rsquo;s license only based on the teacher&rsquo;s conduct -- not based on parents&rsquo; objections to a teacher or a district&rsquo;s decision to provide an accommodation like the study hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Republican Party says Evers &quot;allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teacher was not found guilty of, or even charged with, any crime. Rather, he was fired for viewing pornographic material on his school computer. He got his job back, however, after an arbitrator ruled that the firing was not justified, in part because the arbitrator concluded that the behavior did not endanger any students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers, as the state schools superintendent, had the discretion to initiate license revocation proceedings. But state law at the time required the endangerment of kids in order to revoke a teacher&rsquo;s license and, like the arbitrator, Evers concluded that the teacher&rsquo;s conduct didn&rsquo;t endanger kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-06T13:56:07.971863", "ruling_date": "2017-09-08T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin GOP mostly misfires in attack on governor candidate Tony Evers over school porn case", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-gop-mostly-misfires-attack-governor-cand", "ruling_link_text": "Pivotal: Whether a teacher's conduct endangered kids", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Republican Party, <a href=\"https://www.wisgop.org/2017/08/republican-party-wisconsin-launches-digital-ad-campaign-madison-bureaucrat-tony-evers/\">news release</a>, Aug. 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Alec Zimmerman and attorney Chaz Nichols, Aug. 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Tony Evers campaign spokeswoman Maggie Gau, Aug. 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin State Journal, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/local_schools/scott-walker-asks-dpi-to-begin-license-revocation-proceedings-for/article_07207516-ba8e-5a51-98a5-dd94cfd7e7b3.html\">&quot;Scott Walker asks DPI to begin license revocation proceedings for teacher who viewed porn at school,&quot;</a> Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov.
