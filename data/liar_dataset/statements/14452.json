daughter lauded President Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments on clashes in Charlottesville, Va., was easily identifiable as fake news, because Parks didn&rsquo;t have any children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline on <a href=\"http://forfreedomworld.com/2017/08/20/breaking-rosa-parks-daughter-praises-trumps-response-to-charlottesville/\">an Aug. 20, 2017, post on ForFreedomWorld.com</a> read, &quot;Breaking: Rosa Parks&rsquo; daughter praises Trump&rsquo;s response to Charlottesville.&quot; The story was posted a week after Aug. 12 clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters over&nbsp;efforts to take down Confederate monuments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media giant&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake story is obviously designed to shock readers that the child of a civil rights hero like Parks could embrace controversial comments by Trump, who had <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/14/context-president-donald-trumps-saturday-statement/\">called the violence in Charlottesville</a> a result of&nbsp;&quot;hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post quoted someone named Muriel Parks-Rosenberg speaking at an event at the Kennedy Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Trump&rsquo;s reaction has been criticized by the Left, but I don&rsquo;t see what he did wrong,&quot; she is quoted as saying. &quot;He strongly spoke out against hate both from those who make racial animus their primary cause and anarchists who showed up hoping to watch the world burn.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My mother would have been proud of the President&rsquo;s words,&quot; she allegedly told the crowd. &quot;Liberals who seek to use this rally to further their cause and attack President Trump need to go away and never come back. To me, Donald Trump is a modern civil rights icon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parks is credited as helping spark the civil rights movement after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/us/25parks.html\">died in 2005 at age 92</a>. But she didn&rsquo;t have a daughter who spoke in support of Trump, because Parks never had any children.
