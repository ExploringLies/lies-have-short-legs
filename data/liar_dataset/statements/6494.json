Bill Zedler lofted a double-sided claim about Barack Obama the day the Democratic president raised money by stumping in Texas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Arlington Republican said in a July 17, 2012, Twitter post: &quot;While Obama preaches &lsquo;we are our brother&rsquo;s keeper,&rsquo; his brother &amp; aunt live in real poverty in Kenya.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama often says Americans should care for one another. He said in his <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/23/weekly-address-thanksgiving-grateful-men-and-women-who-defend-our-countr\">weekly radio address</a> of Nov. 24, 2011: &quot;This sense of mutual responsibility &ndash; the idea that I am my brother&rsquo;s keeper; that I am my sister&rsquo;s keeper &ndash; has always been a part of what makes our country special.&quot; He revisited that sentiment in his <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/24/weekly-address-president-and-first-lady-thank-our-troops-their-service-w\">radio address </a>of Dec. 24, 2011 and in a Feb. 2, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/02/remarks-president-national-prayer-breakfast\">speech</a> at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, a Feb. 28, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/02/28/president-obama-speaks-resurgence-american-auto-industry#transcript\">address</a> to the United Auto Workers and a March 30, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/30/remarks-president-campaign-event-0\">campaign speech</a> in Burlington, Vt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd are the president&rsquo;s brother and aunt impoverished in Kenya, as Zedler says?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama has no Kenyan brothers. But by email, Zedler told us he relied on an excerpt of an interview of Obama&rsquo;s Kenyan half-brother, George Obama, by <a href=\"http://www.dineshdsouza.com/\">Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza</a>, a former policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan and author of a 2010 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Roots-Obamas-Rage-Dinesh-DSouza/dp/1596986255\">&quot;The Roots of Obama&rsquo;s Rage.&quot;</a> George and Barack Obama had the same father.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tZedler said he learned of the aunt&rsquo;s conditions from a Fox News report featuring D&rsquo;Souza. On July 17, 2012, &nbsp;D&rsquo;Souza told Fox News host Sean Hannity that George Obama is living in &quot;third-world poverty... And Obama won&rsquo;t lift a finger to help him,&quot; according to a transcript of the appearance we obtained via the Nexis database. D&rsquo;Souza also told Hannity that Obama has an aunt, his late father&rsquo;s sister, &quot;who as we speak is selling coal on the streets of Kenya for a couple dollars a day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA sizable share of Kenyans live in poverty. According to the Kenya <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html\">section</a> of the CIA&rsquo;s &quot;World Factbook,&quot; 50 percent of the nation&rsquo;s residents lived below the poverty line as of 2000. As of 2005, <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/kenya\">according to the World Bank</a>, the share of Kenyans living under the nation&rsquo;s poverty line was 46 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this article, we hunted for evidence that Obama&rsquo;s half-brother and aunt live in poverty and that President Obama has not helped either one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, D&rsquo;Souza told us he was referring to Hawa Auma Obama, whose brother was the president&rsquo;s father. D&rsquo;Souza said his information originated in a 2011 book by reporter Sally H.Jacobs, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Other-Barack-President-ebook/dp/B004THDTBM\">&quot;The Other Barack,&quot;</a> a biography of Obama&rsquo;s father.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJacobs writes in the book that Hawa Auma, a widow, lives in a Kenyan village where she &quot;spends most of her days sitting at the edge of the dirt road next to a pile of charcoal stubs that she sells&quot; for about 40 cents per 2-kilogram tin. The aunt delights in a set of glasses that then-Sen. Obama gave her; he also gave her about $140 when he visited in 2006, Jacobs writes. &quot;She wonders aloud if he will pay to get her teeth fixed,&quot; she writes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tD&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s videotaped interview of George Obama, placed on YouTube July 10, 2012, is <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/barack-obama-brother-anti-documentary-george-obama-346807\">described by</a> the Hollywood Reporter as folding into a soon-to-be released movie featuring D&rsquo;Souza, &quot;2016: Obama&rsquo;s America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the interview, D&rsquo;Souza tells George Obama that he had seen articles on CNN and elsewhere in the 2008 election year suggesting Barack Obama had not &quot;done anything to help you.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think he has a family of his own,&quot; George Obama replies. &quot;He is supposed to help his family.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tD&rsquo;Souza: &quot;...Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re part of his family?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama: &quot;Yeah, I&rsquo;m part of his family. But I&rsquo;m over it. I can help myself.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tD&rsquo;Souza: &quot;...Well, let me put it a different way. Recently, President Obama spoke and he was quoting from the famous story, of Cain and Abel, that we are our brother&rsquo;s keeper.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tD&rsquo;Souza asked George Obama: &quot;Now my point is, you are his brother. Has he been your keeper?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama: &quot;Go ask him. He&rsquo;s got other issues to deal with.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tD&rsquo;Souza: &quot;Well, he&rsquo;s taking care of the world, but don&rsquo;t you start at home?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama: &quot;Yeah, he&rsquo;s taking care of the world. So he&rsquo;s taking care of me. I&rsquo;m part of the world.&quot; Obama then agreed the president doesn&rsquo;t have to help him directly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tD&rsquo;Souza told the Hollywood Reporter that he met George Obama at a Nairobi hotel and they spent about 12 hours together. D&rsquo;Souza is also quoted saying George Obama &quot;lives in rubble on a few dollars a day while his powerful, multi-millionaire brother doesn&#39;t lift a finger to help him.&quot; By email, D&rsquo;Souza told us that George Obama told him he lives on around $10 a month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn D&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s 2010 book on the president, he writes that he read a 2008 <em>London Telegraph</em> news article on George Obama which showed him standing outside a ramshackle hut on Nairobi&rsquo;s outskirts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat Aug. 20, 2008, <em>Telegraph</em> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/2590614/Barack-Obamas-lost-brother-found-in-Kenya.html\">article</a> actually summarizes an article in the Italian edition of Vanity Fair magazine, which said that George Obama, then 26, had met his American half-brother twice -- once when he was a youngster and again in 2006 when Barack Obama visited Nairobi.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his 2010 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Homeland-Extraordinary-Survival-Playaway-Nonfiction/dp/1441733248\">&quot;Homeland,&quot;</a> George Obama wrote that he was nervous about the 2006 visit with his half-brother, who was then a U.S. senator. &quot;I was the kid from the slum, the Obama son who had been a gangster and served time,&quot; he wrote, adding that they greeted each other and shook hands toward the end of a family gathering. He wrote, too, that the pair lacked time for a conversation stretching to issues in the &quot;ghetto&quot; that he and others were trying to address. In the book, he said he briefly saw his half-brother again at a Nairobi hotel and the senator said he would call to chat longer, but no call came.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Obama won the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, George Obama said he agreed to be interviewed by a European journalist -- evidently the one who wrote the article for the Italian Vanity Fair.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Vanity Fair article, as recapped by the Telegraph, quoted George Obama as saying: &quot;No-one knows who I am. I live here on less than a dollar a month.&quot; An accompanying <a href=\"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00793/220-obama-brother_793467f.jpg\">photo</a> is captioned: &quot;George Hussein Onyango Obama, Sen. Barack Obama&#39;s long lost brother, was tracked down living in a hut on the outskirts of Nairobi.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorge Obama wrote in his book that he was photographed standing in the gateway of his late aunt&rsquo;s home. He added: &quot;No one could live on a dollar a day, let alone on three and a half cents a day, not even a Nairobi ghetto-dweller like me.&quot; He lives in a slum, Obama conceded, but did not resent that or feel his brother should do something about his situation. &quot;No way,&quot; George Obama wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the book, Obama further wrote that he later told a CNN reporter, David McKenzie: &quot;I was brought up well; I live well even now.&quot; He said he did a similar interview with the London Times; an Aug. 22, 2008, article is available to paying readers on the Times&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/\">website</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tD&rsquo;Souza&rsquo;s book says a 2008 CNN report -- perhaps the one mentioned in his interview of George Obama -- confirmed the <em>Telegraph&rsquo;</em>s account.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not entirely so. The Oct. 22, 2008, <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2008-08-22/politics/bts.obama.brother_1_half-brother-kenyan-father-barack-obama?_s=PM:POLITICS\">CNN report</a> describes George Obama as angered by the Italian Vanity Fair article. &nbsp;&quot;I was brought up well. I live well even now,&quot; CNN reported Obama as saying. &quot;The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, while George Obama lives in a slum, there are no indications he has been waiting for his half-brother to bail him out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor another observer&rsquo;s take, we asked <em>Washington Post</em> journalist David Maraniss, who travelled to Kenya while researching his 2012 <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Barack-Obama-Story-David-Maraniss/dp/1439160406\">book</a> on Barack Obama&rsquo;s roots, about Zedler&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMaraniss replied that the president has many Kenyan relatives with &quot;varying economic circumstances.&quot; He said he did not visit George Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, we emailed the White House about Zedler&rsquo;s claim, drawing no reply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident Obama, who often refers to being our brother&rsquo;s keepers, has a half-brother, George Obama, living in a Nairobi slum and, as of 2011, a Kenyan aunt who sold charcoal by the road.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president gave the aunt some money in 2006, according to Jacobs&rsquo; account. There appears to be no sign of his otherwise helping his aunt or half-brother.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Zedler&#39;s statement implies the president is not addressing distant family needs. That&rsquo;s at least slightly misleading in that the half-brother has said he doesn&rsquo;t expect such aid. Notably, too, there appear to be no signs of the president revealing that he is or is not privately pitching in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-17T15:57:42.319592", "ruling_date": "2012-08-17T15:08:03", "ruling_headline": "Texas legislator says Barack Obama says we're our brother's keeper while Kenyan relatives live in poverty", "ruling_headline_slug": "texas-legislator-says-barack-obama-says-were-our-b", "ruling_link_text": "Close to half of Kenyans in poverty", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSpeeches, Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/02/remarks-president-national-prayer-breakfast\">&quot;Remarks by the President at the National Prayer Breakfast,&quot;</a> Feb. 2, 2012; <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/02/28/president-obama-speaks-resurgence-american-auto-industry#transcript\">&quot;Remarks by the President to UAW Conference,&quot;</a> Feb. 28, 2012; <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/30/remarks-president-campaign-event-0\">&quot;Remarks by the President at a Campaign Event,&quot;</a> March 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNews article, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/barack-obama-brother-anti-documentary-george-obama-346807\">&quot;Barack Obama&#39;s Brother to Make Film Debut in Anti-Obama Documentary,&quot;</a> <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTranscript, Sean Hannity interview of Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza, Fox News, July 17, 2012 (Nexis search)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBook, &quot;The Other Barack,&quot; Sally H.
