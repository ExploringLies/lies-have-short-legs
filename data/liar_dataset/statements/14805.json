The headline reads: &quot;Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: &lsquo;Trump is a serious threat to human rights.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Later, the headline was changed to read, &quot;Donald Trump Not Welcome At Prince Harry&rsquo;s Wedding To American Actress: Trump Is A &lsquo;Serious Threat To Human Rights.&rsquo; &quot; We&rsquo;re evaluating the original headline.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry and Meghan became engaged earlier in November but <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/his-royal-highness-prince-henry-wales-and-ms-meghan-markle-are-engaged-be-married\">announced</a> their engagement on Nov. 27. Very few details have been released about the wedding, other than it will take place in Spring 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no record of Prince Harry uninviting Trump, nor is it likely that he would. The royal family typically tries to shy away from drama. The royal family has put out <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/press-releases\">two press releases</a> regarding the engagement, and neither mention an invite list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Obamas were not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton&rsquo;s wedding in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other quote in the title, &quot;Trump is a serious threat to human rights,&quot; is from reporting done in an <em>Us Weekly</em> <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-prince-harry-is-not-a-fan-of-president-donald-trump-w464116/\">article</a>. <em>Us Weekly</em> said a &quot;close source&quot; told them that Harry &quot;is not a fan&quot; of Trump and thinks he &quot;is a serious threat to human rights.&quot; But that source was anonymous and we don&rsquo;t find it credible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nova article said that Markle called Trump &quot;misogynistic&quot; and joked about moving to Canada (where <em>Suits </em>is filmed) if he were elected. Markle did say that, on a panel she participated on for <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/video-clips/kk58nn/the-nightly-show-with-larry-wilmore-panel---is-donald-trump-unstoppable-\">Comedy Central&rsquo;s <em>Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</em></a> on May 4, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems unlikely that Trump will be invited to the royal wedding. But Harry never made a statement about it, nor did he say that Trump was a serious threat to human rights. Such a statement would have garnered worldwide headlines.&nbsp;We rate the claim that Harry said Trump was not welcome to the royal wedding as Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-01T15:15:03.870590", "ruling_date": "2017-12-01T15:53:01", "ruling_headline": "Prince Harry never said Donald Trump wasn't welcome at his wedding", "ruling_headline_slug": "prince-harry-never-said-donald-trump-wasnt-welcome", "ruling_link_text": "Harry observes protocol, keeps mouth shut", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Nova Magazine, <a href=\"https://www.nova-magazine.net/prince-harry-trump-not-welcome-wedding-meghan-markle/\">Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: &lsquo;Trump is a serious threat to human rights&rsquo;</a>, Nov. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media Center for the Royal Family, Press Releases <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/wedding-prince-harry-and-msmeghan-markle\">1</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/his-royal-highness-prince-henry-wales-and-ms-meghan-markle-are-engaged-be-married\">2</a>, Nov. 28 &amp; 27 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Weekly, <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-prince-harry-is-not-a-fan-of-president-donald-trump-w464116/\">Why Prince Harry Is &lsquo;Not a Fan&rsquo; of President Donald Trump</a>, Feb. 1 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Mail, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1358965/Obamas-invited-Prince-William-Kate-Middletons-Royal-wedding.html#ixzz502Uahoxx\">No invite for the Obamas as the Queen personally asks 40 other heads of state to attend Prince William&#39;s wedding to Kate</a>, Feb. 20, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comedy Central,<a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-prince-harry-is-not-a-fan-of-president-donald-trump-w464116/\"> Is Donald Trump Unstoppable?</a>, May 4, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4119, "last_name": "Nova magazine", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "nova-magazine", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4119/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: &lsquo;Trump is a serious threat to human rights.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an article", "statement_date": "2017-11-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
