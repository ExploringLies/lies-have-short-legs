Those cuts, combined with falling local property tax collections, have forced school districts to reduce staff, increase class sizes, furlough employees and shorten their school years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chances ramped up for education to be a hot topic in the Republican primary as well, with State School Superintendent John Barge in the mix of announced GOP challengers to incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started our truth test of Carter&rsquo;s statement by asking for the source of his information. A spokeswoman referred us to a November report published by the left-leaning Georgia Budget &amp; Policy Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report was based on an online survey taken over the summer. Of the state&rsquo;s 180 school districts, 140 -- representing 92.8 percent of all public schools -- participated, according to the GBPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the findings: The surveyed districts now have 8,982 fewer teachers in their classrooms than they did in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked in with the state&rsquo;s two major teacher groups -- the Professional Association of Georgia Educators and the Georgia Association of Educators. The data developed by the GBPI and cited by Carter seems &quot;credible to me,&quot; PAGE spokesman Tim Callahan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Added GAE President Calvine Rollins: &quot;What we do know is that class sizes have increased tremendously.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We compared the GBPI information against data that districts are required to submit annually to the state.The results were very similar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fiscal 2009, which covers the 2008-2009 school year, Georgia had 120,660 teachers in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade -- 115,277 full-time and 5,383 part-time -- according to the annual state report card on education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That compares with 111,401 public school teachers -- 107,729 full-time and 3,672 part-time -- working in fiscal 2013, or the 2012-2013 school year. And the difference is 9,259 fewer teachers statewide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As to the claim by Carter, that school enrollment rose in this period, state data show he&rsquo;s correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Student enrollment wasn&rsquo;t growing rapidly but it did increase. There were 1,615,066 students in Georgia public schools in fiscal 2009 and 1,657,506 in attendance in fiscal 2013, according to state data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 1, the 180 districts collectively counted and reported to the state Department of Education that they had 1,723,439 students on their rolls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter&rsquo;s statement was based on solid &nbsp;numbers. Georgia has lost about 7.6 percent of its teachers since 2009. Enrollment wasn&rsquo;t booming, but it did grow by about 2.6 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement as True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-20T15:51:57.920657", "ruling_date": "2014-02-21T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Carter scores well with claim about teacher cuts", "ruling_headline_slug": "georgia-down-9000-plus-teachers", "ruling_link_text": "Spotlight on education cuts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sources:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press <a href=\"http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Release---Sen--Jason-Carter-Rolls-Out-Edu-Reform-Initiatives.html?soid=1101819846149&amp;aid=MAQwkYk8DvA#fblike\">statement </a>by state Sen.
