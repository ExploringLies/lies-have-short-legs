Littlefield sent us that chart plus a second one showing estimated tax bills in each city.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEd Van Eenoo, Austin&rsquo;s city budget officer, told us by email that his office created the charts with 2011 tax rates, home values and sales price information from county appraisal districts and the <a href=\"about:blank\">Real Estate Center</a> at Texas A&amp;M University.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked the numbers with the districts and center, and found Austin&rsquo;s property tax rate was the lowest, considerably, of <a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn37.html\">Texas&rsquo; five biggest cities</a>, as Leffingwell said. The full list: Fort Worth, <a href=\"http://www.tad.org/webpages/2011_tax_rates.cfm\">85.5</a> cents per $100 of appraised value; Dallas, <a href=\"http://www.dallascad.org/forms/2011rate.pdf\">79.7</a> cents; Houston, <a href=\"http://www.hcad.org/resources/jurlist.asp\">63.875</a> cents; San Antonio, <a href=\"http://www.bexar.org/tax/PropertyTaxRates2011.html\">56.5569</a> cents, Austin, 48.11 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut tax rates are only part of the equation when it comes to figuring out how hard a homeowner&rsquo;s pocketbook gets hit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere, in fact, is the equation, from Austin&rsquo;s budget office: Take your house&rsquo;s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate -- with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than &quot;48.11 cents.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe calculated how much typical homeowners had to pay in 2011 using two different measures: average appraised values from each county tax appraisal districts, and median sales price from the center, which gets data from real estate professionals across the state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough exemptions affect many tax bills, we excluded them here because they vary with each homeowner and each city, county and taxing jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2011, Austin had both the highest median sale price and the highest average appraised value among the five cities. But because of the city&rsquo;s low tax rate, Austin&rsquo;s tax bill (excluding exemptions) on an average-value home was second-highest, and its tax bill on a median sales-price home came in fourth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalculated using 2011 median sales price and 2011 city tax rate, Dallas had the highest bill -- $1,262 on a $158,400 house -- followed by Houston&rsquo;s $982 on a $153,700 house, Fort Worth&rsquo;s $946 bill on a $110,600 house, Austin&rsquo;s $918 on a $190,900 house and San Antonio&rsquo;s $856 on a $151,300 house.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the same tax rates and 2011&rsquo;s average appraised values, Dallas was first again, with a $1,441 bill on a $180,847 house, followed by Austin&rsquo;s $1,224 bill on a $254,328 house, Houston&rsquo;s $1,057 on a $165,535 house, Fort Worth&rsquo;s $968 on a $113,247 house and San Antonio&rsquo;s $725 on a $128,151 house.</p>\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<table style=\"border: medium none; border-collapse: collapse; width: 600px; height: 238px;\">\r\n\t\t<colgroup>\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"*\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"*\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"*\" />\r\n\t\t\t<col width=\"*\" />\r\n\t\t</colgroup>\r\n\t\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t\t<tr style=\"height:0px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Median home sale price, 2011</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>2011 city tax bill using median sale price</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Average appraised home value, 2011</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>2011 city tax bill using average appraised value</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr style=\"height:0px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>1. <a href=\"http://recenter.tamu.edu/data/hs/hs140.asp\">Austin</a>, $190,900</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td style=\"border:1px dotted #aaa;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1.

Medians represent a &quot;middle&quot; value -- median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half a city&#39;s homes sold for more and half sold for less.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe city&#39;s tax bill chart used median sales prices, except for Austin, where the median appraised home value was available, and factored in homestead exemptions. Reckoned that way, Austin&rsquo;s tax bill again came out second-highest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course, cities are only one of the entities taking a chomp out of your property taxes. Depending on where your house is, county government, school districts, community colleges and possibly many others get a bite.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Austin owner of a $190,900 home in 2011, for example, <a href=\"http://www.co.travis.tx.us/tax_assessor/rates/default.asp\">paid</a> $2,371 to the Austin school district; $927 to Travis County; $181 to Austin Community College; and $151 to Central Health (Travis County&rsquo;s healthcare district) on top of the $918 city tax bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, Austinites recently learned that 2013 might bring an increase in the city&rsquo;s rate. The <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/local/to-keep-up-with-rising-costs-austin-may-2313843.html\">reported</a> April 18 that the owner of a median-value home would pay $33 more under a tax rate of 49.95 cents per $100 of property -- the rate city staffers said Austin would need to cover its costs next year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeffingwell responded to the news with a statement that he would look for ways to cut spending rather than raise the property tax rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat 49.95-cent rate for 2012 is still lower than the other cities&rsquo; 2011 rates, but it&rsquo;s too early to know what all the 2012 rates -- and home values -- will be.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeffingwell&rsquo;s right on the rates. Austin had the lowest 2011 city property tax rate among Texas&rsquo; five biggest cities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet rates alone are not the only, or even best, indicator of how much residents have been socked by property taxes. Comparing each city&rsquo;s average-value home in 2011, for instance, Austin would have extracted the second-highest tax payment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithout this context, Leffingwell&rsquo;s rate comparison misrepresents this pocketbook issue.
