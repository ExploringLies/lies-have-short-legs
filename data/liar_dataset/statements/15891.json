A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moderator: </strong>The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population &nbsp;&mdash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evers:</strong> Absolutely, and that&#39;s a goal that&rsquo;s worth accomplishing &hellip; We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Walker campaign argues that Evers&rsquo; response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because <a href=\"http://micahmke.org/what-we-do/criminal-justice-reform/\">MICAH&rsquo;s website</a> refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/05/democrats-running-governor-call-slashing-prison-population/756223002/\">Evers has said</a> Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://law.wisc.edu/profiles/kmstreit@wisc.edu\">Kenneth Streit</a>, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us it&rsquo;s possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes &mdash; or at least not thousands of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, despite Walker&rsquo;s claim, it&rsquo;s also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more point before we close:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.justicepolicy.org/About1/Staff.html\">Ryan King</a>, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the <a href=\"https://apps.urban.org/features/long-prison-terms/reform.html\">Urban Institute</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2012/06/06/time_served_report.pdf\">Pew Research Center</a>, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker says Evers &quot;wants to cut Wisconsin&#39;s prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that &mdash; a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nExperts say a 50 percent reduction over a relatively short period, say a few years, would require the release of inmates convicted of violent crimes.
