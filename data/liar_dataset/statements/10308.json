He produced and used weapons of mass destruction. And he had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheney and the rest of the administration of President George W. Bush made the link between Saddam&nbsp;Hussein and al-Qaida a linchpin in its rationale for war. In that light, Cheney&rsquo;s claim about a 10-year relationship merits a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His statement runs counter to at least two major official inquiries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.9-11commission.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>9/11 Commission</u></a>, an independent, bipartisan body created by Congress and Bush, had the job of writing a complete account of the circumstances surrounding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among its tasks: Examine the ties between al-Qaida and Hussein&rsquo;s regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commission found isolated contacts over the years between Iraq and al-Qaida terrorists but nothing more. The commission released its report in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship,&quot; <a href=\"http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/index.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the report said</u></a>. &quot;Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated with al-Qaida in developing or carrying out any attacks against the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, the <a href=\"http://a.abcnews.com/images/pdf/Pentagon_Report_V1.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Institute for Defense Analyses</u></a>, a nonprofit research branch of the Pentagon&rsquo;s Joint Forces Command, completed its assessment based on over half-a-million captured Iraqi documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That study &quot;found no &lsquo;smoking gun&rsquo; (i.e., direct connection) between Saddam&#39;s Iraq and al-Qaida,&quot; the analysts wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it suited their goals, both the Hussein regime and al-Qaida leaders might support the same third-party militant groups in different countries, but the researchers said the two parties had little else in common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To the fundamentalist leadership of al-Qaida, Saddam represented the worst kind of &lsquo;apostate&rsquo; regime,&quot; they wrote. &quot;A secular police state well practiced in suppressing internal challenges.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al-Qaida had good reason to mistrust Hussein. In the mid 1990s, the Iraqi government cracked down and arrested religious extremists who it saw as a threat to Hussein&rsquo;s power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Neumann is a professor in the War Studies Department at King&rsquo;s College in London and the author of several books on terrorism. Neumann called Cheney&rsquo;s statement &quot;absolutely false.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was no relationship of any kind, and Vice President Cheney, despite making these claims for more than 10 years now, has failed to present any evidence to support it,&quot; Neumann said. &quot;He&#39;s, as far as I can see, also the only significant person in the Bush administration that&#39;s left making this claim.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are isolated examples where Iraqis operating on their own joined forces with al-Qaida and still maintained contacts with members of the Iraqi military, but there is no sign that the connection was any stronger than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tried to reach Cheney through&nbsp;a<strong> </strong>spokesman and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, Cheney said that Hussein either supported or tolerated some fundamentalists who went on to become al-Qaida leaders. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/17/the-cheneys-claims-of-a-deep-longstanding-far-reaching-relationship-between-al-qaeda-and-saddam/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u><em>Washington Post</em> Fact Checker</u></a> looked at Cheney&rsquo;s evidence in July 2014 and found it lacking. Hussein was ready to encourage extremists when he thought they would destabilize his enemies such as the Kurds in northern Iraq. That&rsquo;s not the sort of relationship that would tie&nbsp;Iraq to the 9/11 attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheney said Hussein had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida. Two comprehensive, high-level government reports largely&nbsp;refute that statement.&nbsp;That includes one Pentagon study that relied on a trove of secret Iraqi government documents that fell into American hands after the invasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are cases where the two interests overlapped, there is no evidence of a deep-rooted, meaningful relationship over&nbsp;10 years as Cheney claimed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-12-14T11:24:57.785814", "ruling_date": "2014-12-14T16:42:51", "ruling_headline": "Cheney on torture report: Saddam Hussein 'had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida'", "ruling_headline_slug": "cheney-torture-report-saddam-hussein-had-10-year-r", "ruling_link_text": "A very misleading characterization", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NBC, <em><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-december-14-2014-n268181\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Meet the Press</u></a></em>, Dec. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Joint Forces Command, Institute for Defense Analyses, <a href=\"http://a.abcnews.com/images/pdf/Pentagon_Report_V1.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Iraqi Perspectives Project Saddam and Terrorism: Emerging Insights from Captured Iraqi Documents</u></a>, November 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States, <a href=\"http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/index.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>9-11 Commission Report</u></a>, July 22, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/13/alqaeda.saddam/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hussein&#39;s Iraq and al Qaeda not linked, Pentagon says</u></a>, March 13, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Weekly Standard</em>, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/wikileaks-iraq-al-qaeda-connection-confirmed-again_558271.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>WikiLeaks: The Iraq-Al Qaeda Connection Confirmed, Again</u></a>, April 26, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/opinion/saddam-hussein-and-al-qaeda-are-not-allies.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Opinion: Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda Are Not Allies</u></a>, Sept. 30, 2002</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-no-saddam-al-qaeda-link/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pentagon: No Saddam-Al Qaeda Link</u></a>, April 6, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Guardian</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/13/iraq.usa\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Saddam Hussein had no direct ties to al-Qaida, says Pentagon study</u></a>, March 13, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/washington/09intelcnd.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate Panel Releases Report on Iraq Intelligence</u></a>, Sept. 8, 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/17/the-cheneys-claims-of-a-deep-longstanding-far-reaching-relationship-between-al-qaeda-and-saddam/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Cheneys&rsquo;
