This stop on his multi-state &quot;thank-you tour&quot; was mostly a campaign-style rally, but there was some policy, too. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Midway into his remarks, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?420078-1/presidentelect-trump-vice-presidentelect-pence-deliver-remarks-west-allis-wisconsin&amp;start=2423\">Trump said</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re going to undertake one of the great tax reforms and simplifications in American history. This includes a massive tax cut for the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/nov/10/donald-trumps-campaign-promises-first-100-days/\">middle-class</a> and middle-class families from Wisconsin, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re also going to lower our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2016/oct/14/guide-trumps-promises-businesses-and-families/\">business tax rate</a> so that new companies will come to our shores and hire workers in cities like right here. Is that OK? That&rsquo;s what we want. We&rsquo;re going to bring our rates down from 35 percent, we&rsquo;re going to try to get it down to 15 percent. So, right now -- and by the way the jobs will pour in -- so, right now, we&rsquo;re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And when we finish, we&rsquo;ll be one of the lower taxed, one of the lower.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the president-elect keeps his promises on taxes will be something to be determined by PolitiFact National&rsquo;s Trump-O-Meter, which <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/nov/17/coming-2017-trump-o-meter/\">will be launched</a> in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we can answer now whether America&rsquo;s business tax rate is the highest in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top U.S. rate: 35%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corporate income tax rates in the United States range from <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675844.pdf\">15 to 35 percent</a>. And that 35 percent top rate -- at least as a &quot;statutory&quot; rate (more on that below) -- is relatively high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publishes <a href=\"http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204\">the top corporate tax rates</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/list-oecd-member-countries.htm\">35 countries</a> that belong to its organization, which includes most advanced, industrialized nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S&rsquo; top rate of 35 percent ranks first, just ahead of France, 34.4 percent; Belgium, 33 percent; and Australia and Mexico, 30 percent. On the low end: Switzerland, 8.5 percent; Ireland, 12.5 percent; Latvia and Canada, 15 percent; and Germany, 15.8 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes references are made to a combined corporate tax rate, which includes federal and state corporate taxes; the U.S.&rsquo; combined rate is <a href=\"http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=58204\">38.9 percent</a>. But Trump was referring to the 35 percent federal rate, the one he vows to reduce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are, however, two clarifying points to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other nations, and what is paid</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Trump&rsquo;s statement, his campaign cited a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/taxanalysts/2015/03/25/the-truth-about-corporate-tax-rates/#22f462be20a5\">Forbes article</a> that noted the United States has the highest corporate rate among industrialized nations. But Trump didn&rsquo;t limit his statement to industrialized nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The accounting firm PwC tracks the top federal corporate tax rates for <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/tax/corporate-tax/worldwide-tax-summaries.html\">155 countries</a>. <a href=\"http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/uk/taxsummaries/wwts.nsf/ID/Corporate-income-tax-(CIT)-rates\">That list</a> shows five other countries that also have a top rate of 35 percent: Argentina, Chad, Congo, Malta and Zambia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are two countries with higher top corporate tax rates: United Arab Emirates, 55 percent; and Puerto Rico, 39 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also needs to be understood that America&rsquo;s 35 percent top rate is the statutory rate -- before deductions -- but U.S. companies aren&rsquo;t actually taxed at that rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, a <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675844.pdf\">March 2016 report</a> by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that in each year from 2006 to 2012, at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability, although larger corporations were more likely to owe tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a <a href=\"http://equitablegrowth.org/report/profit-shifting-and-u-s-corporate-tax-policy-reform/\">May 2016 paper</a> by Reed College economics professor Kimberly Clausing found U.S. multinational firms have used tax planning to generate effective tax rates &quot;that are far lower than the statutory rate, and often in the single digits.&quot;<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said America&rsquo;s federal business tax rate is the highest &quot;in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent, highest among the world&rsquo;s industrialized nations. But five smaller nations have the same rate and two smaller ones, United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, have rates above 35 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the 35 percent U.S. rate is only the starting point, given that corporations can use exemptions and deductions to effectively reduce that rate and pay lower taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/077f53a2-c756-458f-b4f3-4f872d820085\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/077f53a2-c756-458f-b4f3-4f872d820085</a>\r\n",
