He and co-founder Tom Koehler invited Brady to join their board nearly a decade ago, and she has been chairwoman since.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So she has and has had a key leadership role in the company, and she&#39;s an investor herself,&quot; Blosser said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWho are we to argue with that?
