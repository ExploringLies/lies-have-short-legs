And we&#39;re going to keep it that way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hall, a businessman who joined the Senate&rsquo;s ruling Republicans in 2015, told the newspaper: &quot;I&#39;m not one to try to get my name in lights when it comes to passing bills. I see myself as part of a team.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, has Hall not advanced any of his own measures into law?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Records show a Hall&nbsp;proposal advancing into law</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before reaching Scudder, we gauged Hall&rsquo;s record by searching the <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/\">Texas Legislature Online</a> website maintained by the Texas Legislative Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our searches for proposals authored by Hall that Gov. Greg Abbott signed or let into law showed one such accomplishment. In the 2017 regular session, the Hall-authored <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;Bill=SB102\">Senate Bill 102</a>, clarifying position titles in the Texas National Guard, made it through the Senate and House and was <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Actions.aspx?LegSess=85R&amp;Bill=SB102\">signed into law</a> on June 1, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hall said in a June 2017 <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/85R/analysis/html/SB00102F.htm\">statement of intent</a> filed with the proposal that lawmakers previously created new general officer positions within the Texas National Guard but the federal government didn&rsquo;t recognize or fund the position titles. &quot;This bill would clarify these new general officer titles and duties to allow for proper recognition and funding,&quot; Hall said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hall otherwise authored 52 proposals in 2015 and 69 more in 2017, records indicate. Put another way, about 1 percent of his authored legislation made it into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet that rate doesn&#39;t capture Hall&#39;s full legislative record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the regular sessions and a summer 2017 special session, records show, Hall co-sponsored measures offered by others--some of which passed into law. In 2015, Hall was a co-sponsor of seven House bills that passed into law and in 2017, Hall co-sponsored three House measures in the regular session that made it into law and three House proposals that passed into law after action in the special session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scudder, responding by email, told us his point in Dallas was that Hall hasn&rsquo;t been effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was specifically referring to Sen. Hall&#39;s inability to pass legislation benefiting his district as a primary author (in short stump speeches, it can be difficult to specifically outline the intricacies of legislative processes),&quot; Scudder wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scudder said Hall has never passed a bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hall&#39;s had scant success ushering his own measures into law. Still, he authored a 2017 proposal clarifying Texas National Guard titles that passed into law. He&#39;s separately cosponsored other&nbsp;proposals now in statute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is not accurate.
