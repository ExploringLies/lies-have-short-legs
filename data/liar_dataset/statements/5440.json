Scott Garrett, half of the nation won&rsquo;t pay any money to the government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Sussex County Republican claimed during a Feb. 15 interview on WOR-AM that half of all Americans don&rsquo;t pay federal income taxes. After discussing the federal budget, Garrett cited that statistic when host John Gambling pointed out the economic turmoil unfolding in Greece.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGarrett (R-5th Dist.) responded, &quot;That&rsquo;s the absurd situation they&rsquo;ve got over there where the average person on the street relied so heavily on the government for his livelihood, for his well-being. We don&rsquo;t want to be in that situation in this country, but we&rsquo;re getting close to it, when half the Americans don&rsquo;t pay any income taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found that Garrett is right, according to research done by two nonpartisan groups. Both groups confirm that about half of all American households do not have to pay any federal income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur PolitiFact colleagues around the country have tackled similar statements a few times before and reached the same conclusion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain the data that supports Garrett&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back up the congressman&rsquo;s point, Garrett spokesman Ben Veghte directed us to a July 2011 report from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that report, the center estimated that about 46 percent of &quot;tax units&quot; would pay no federal income tax for 2011 -- the most current estimate available. The center had estimated that 49.5 percent of tax units didn&rsquo;t pay federal income taxes for 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA tax unit is an individual or married couple that either files a tax return or would have to file one if their income was high enough, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the center, said in an e-mail. In other words, a tax unit is roughly equivalent to a household, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the 46.4 percent of units not paying income taxes for 2011, about half was due to the fact that those units had no taxable income after subtracting the standard deduction and personal exemptions, Williams said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The other half qualified for various exclusions, itemized deductions, special exemptions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits that wiped out any tax liability,&quot; Williams told us. That second group includes tax units benefiting from education and child credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s talk about the other group backing up Garrett&rsquo;s statistic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn April 2011, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress, released an analysis estimating that slightly more than 50 percent of all tax units would owe no federal income taxes for 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf those tax units, about 22 percent would have a zero income tax liability and about 30 percent would actually get money back from the government, according to the committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, both groups support Garrett&rsquo;s claim that roughly half of all American households pay no federal income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a radio interview, Garrett claimed &quot;half the Americans don&rsquo;t pay any income taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat claim is backed up by research from two nonpartisan groups -- the Tax Policy Center and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Both groups have estimated that about half of all American households did not owe federal income taxes in recent years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/politifact_nj_congressman_garr.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-28T16:10:53.321747", "ruling_date": "2012-02-29T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Congressman Scott Garrett claims half of all Americans don\u2019t pay federal income taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "congressman-scott-garrett-claims-half-all-american", "ruling_link_text": "No taxing this claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe John Gambling Show, <a href=\"http://wor710.com/pages/11653468.php\">Interview with Congressman Scott Garrett</a>, Feb. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2011/nov/17/rob-cornilles/do-more-half-all-tax-filers-really-pay-no-federal-/\">Do more than half of all tax filers really pay no federal income tax?</a>, Nov. 17, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/may/09/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-almost-50-percent-americans-dont-/\">Eric Cantor says almost 50 percent of Americans don&#39;t pay income taxes</a>, May 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/sep/16/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-wolf-blitzer-was-wro/\">Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Wolf Blitzer was wrong to say the wealthiest pay the most in taxes</a>, Sept. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/08/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-51-percent-american-households-pa/\">John Cornyn says 51 percent of American households pay no income tax</a>, July 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/federal-taxes-households.cfm\">Who Doesn&#39;t Pay Federal Taxes?</a>, accessed Feb. 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2011/07/27/why-do-people-pay-no-federal-income-tax-2/\">Why Do People Pay No Federal Income Tax?</a>, July 27, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Ben Veghte, spokesman for Congressman Scott Garrett, Feb. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/1001547-Why-No-Income-Tax.pdf\">Why Some Tax Units Pay No Income Tax</a>, July 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Senate Committee on Finance, <a href=\"http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/ranking/release/?id=c82fcc02-feeb-40a6-9603-773bbec718a0\">Memorandum to Reporters &amp;
