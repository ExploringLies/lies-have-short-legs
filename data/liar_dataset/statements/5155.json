He&#39;s not forcing anyone to join him. He&#39;s off in the zone. You see players sitting with their head down. He happens to kneel on one knee. But that is the mindset we&#39;re dealing with in 2012.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLombardi joined in, saying he&#39;s &quot;concerned about the slippery slope. Where does it end? . . . I don&#39;t know where it ends. I&#39;m certainly troubled by Tim Tebow&#39;s situation where you&#39;re going to regulate private behavior. I think that goes against everything that we stand for.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven we thought that atheists and the ACLU would be guilty of a personal foul if they were trying to get the Broncos&rsquo; quarterback in trouble for committing prayer interference.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we went to Google to search for stories about the ACLU-atheist demand to the NFL.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe came up empty-handed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we contacted DePetro. He sent us links to two web pages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first was a story by the CBS affiliate in Denver headlined &quot;<a href=\"http://denver.cbslocal.com/2012/01/10/atheist-group-believes-tebow-full-of-crap-with-public-display-of-christianity/\">Atheist Group Believes Tebow &#39;Full Of Crap&#39; With Public Display of Christianity</a>.&quot; It quotes David Silverman, president of a New Jersey-based group, American Atheists, and makes no reference to any demand to the NFL or any reference to the ACLU.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second was from <a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/badcatholic/2012/01/tim-tebow-full-of-crap.html\">the Bad Catholic blog </a>on Patheos.com criticizing Silverman&#39;s comments. Again, no reference to any demand to the NFL and no reference at all to the ACLU.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe asked Patrick Smyth, executive director of media relations for the Broncos about DePetro&#39;s statement. &quot;This is the first I&#39;ve heard of that,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;No, not aware of this,&quot; said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We haven&#39;t made any demands,&quot; said Silverman, president of the atheist organization. &quot;No law is being broken. He has the right to do it. We think he&#39;s wrong to exercise his right this way. But we don&#39;t have the right to demand anything because the NFL is a private enterprise. It&#39;s like demanding someone say Merry Christmas versus Happy Holidays.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, we called the ACLU of Colorado, where spokeswoman Rosemary Harris Lytle said DePetro&#39;s statement was not true.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The ACLU would never demand that anyone stop praying. A lot of our work is standing up for [religious] rights, even for people some of us would consider extremists,&quot; she said. &quot;We would stand for religious liberty and religious diversity for people of all faith backgrounds&quot; as long as it doesn&#39;t violate the separation of church and state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(In fact, the ACLU has a web page devoted to <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/aclu-defense-religious-practice-and-expression\">highlighting cases it has supported to protect the rights of individuals to practice or express their religion</a>.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTalk radio host John DePetro said, while discussing quarterback Tim Tebow, that the &quot;ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop him from praying on the sidelines.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDePetro&#39;s evidence consisted of two web pages that make no such claim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd given the ACLU&#39;s history of defending an individual&#39;s right to practice his or her religion, the idea that the organization would try to block Tebow from praying when he&#39;s not bothering anyone or disrupting a game is ridiculous<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&#39;ve seen the light.
