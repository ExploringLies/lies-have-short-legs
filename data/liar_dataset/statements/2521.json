Instead of citing his website&rsquo;s position, Gibbs applauded Boehner&rsquo;s leadership and said the nation needs to seriously discuss how to make entitlement programs actuarially sound.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our younger folks in their 20s and 30s, they think their retirement age is going to move up, I think they expect that,&quot; said Gibbs. &quot;We&rsquo;re living longer, our life expectancies are going up, and you just can&rsquo;t have an actuarially sound system if you don&rsquo;t make these changes or you&rsquo;re not going to have a system at all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat struck us as a complete reversal of his previous position -- &nbsp;a Full Flop.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen at a Sept. 18 <a href=\"http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/10/09/20/gibbs-sutton-duke-it-out.php\">debate</a> in Mount Vernon between Gibbs and Constitution Party candidate Lindsay Sutton, Gibbs <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hg_EQ_obBk\">suggested</a> forming a bipartisan task force to ensure Social Security&rsquo;s viability, and went on to say: &quot;I doubt I would have supported it back in the 1930&rsquo;s when they did it, but we have it now and we&rsquo;ve got to fulfill our obligations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe remark that he might have opposed creation of Social Security prompted the Space campaign to denounce Gibbs. &quot;Bob Gibbs&rsquo; complete hostility toward this crucial program is just plain shameless,&quot; Space spokesman Andrew Ricci said in a <a href=\"http://www.zackspace.org/release_details.asp?id=75\">news release</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked for Gibbs&rsquo; true stance on Social Security in light of his public comments. His spokeswoman, Emily Pettigrew, replied with this email:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You can pull a clip here and a clip there and make it sound like anything, the fact is that Bob Gibbs stands firm that we should not raise the retirement age, we should not cut benefits, and we should not privatize Social Security.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPettigrew said efforts to highlight Gibbs&rsquo; remarks were just a &quot;distraction tactic&quot; &quot;straight from Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s playbook of desperation.&quot; She accused Space of &quot;trying to take the focus off of the double-digit unemployment in the district&quot; under his watch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Gibbs&rsquo; own words provide ample fodder for distraction.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tHis remarks to the Eastern Ohio Developement Alliance clearly contradict his official campaign position that the Social Security retirement age should not be raised.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tHis statement in the Mount Vernon debate suggests he would have opposed creation of Social Security in the first place.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThen there&rsquo;s the statement from his campaign to clarify his position, which clearly contradicts his remarks to the Eastern Ohio Development Alliance. That statement represents a Full Flop on the Full Flop.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, we end up back where we started. But given the gyrations taken with Gibbs&rsquo; public statements on Social Security, followed up by his campaign comment, he has earned high marks as a Flip-O-Meter gymnast. We award him a Full Flop.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/10/bob_gibbs_social_security_posi.html\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-04T14:41:48.469286", "ruling_date": "2010-10-04T14:45:00", "ruling_headline": "Bob Gibbs' Social Security position somersaults from website to public statements to campaign lines", "ruling_headline_slug": "gibbs-website-public-statements-vary-social-securi", "ruling_link_text": "It's this way!
