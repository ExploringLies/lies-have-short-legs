Rick Perry speaks often of his experience in directing security dollars and operations along the Texas/Mexico border. Repeatedly in the first three months of his bid for the White House, Perry has mentioned sending $400 million to the border.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes he states it broadly; e.g., <a href=\"http://c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/clip.php?appid=600624997\">&quot;a total of $400 million of state security operations.&quot;</a> But often, he pegs the amount to <a href=\"http://www.governorperry.com/media-articles/texas-rangers-deployment-mexico-border-military-style-effort\">a force he helped create</a> in 2009: Texas Ranger Reconnaissance Teams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt an Oct. 1, 2011, event in Hampton, N.H., <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/texas-politics/2012-presidential-election/gov-perry-gives-deeper-answer-immigration/\">Perry said</a>, &quot;I have sent over $400 million to the border of Mexico in the form of Texas Ranger recon teams.&quot; He&rsquo;s used such a formulation at least three times since he entered the race in September -- including <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1109/12/se.06.html\">onstage at the Sept. 12 GOP debate</a> -- so we decided to dig in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRewind: On Sept. 10, 2009, Perry <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=987DSCGgF7k\">announced </a>the recent creation of Ranger Reconnaissance Teams that he said would operate in high-traffic, high-crime areas along the Texas-Mexico border -- a move he described as the state&rsquo;s latest effort to fill gaps left by the federal government&rsquo;s &quot;failure to adequately secure&quot; the border. Perry said the recon teams would be &quot;individuals that can stay on the move. We can stay one jump ahead of the cartels and beat them at their own game.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a subsequent <a href=\"http://www.texasranger.org/today/Annual_Reports/2009_DPS_Annual_Report_Texas_Rangers_Division.pdf\">Department of Public Safety report</a>, the teams were being used for &quot;emergencies and other situations that require a specialized law enforcement response ... &nbsp;to locations throughout the state to&quot; head off or deal with &quot;criminal or terrorist incidents that could impact public safety.&quot; The report also says the teams are trained in tracking, night-vision equipment, air operations and surveillance; can operate for extended periods in remote, rugged areas; and can include National Guard counter-drug and other personnel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore details proved hard to come by. An <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/perrys-border-recon-teams-work-remains-secret-881855.html\">Aug. 26, 2010, Associated Press news story</a> says the DPS declined to share mission reports, citing operational security.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd what about Perry&rsquo;s proclaimed $400 million for those boots on the ground?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPerry&rsquo;s campaign and his state office provided budget figures indicating that he signed into law nearly $415 million in spending on border security covering September 2005 through August 2013, meaning fiscal years 2006 through 2013. Lucy Nashed in Perry&rsquo;s state office directed us to the agencies that received the appropriations for details.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost of the money flows through DPS, and agency spokesman Tom Vinger gave us figures indicating that Texas allocated border security funds for 2006-13 (with the 2011-13 amounts being estimated) totaling $475.6 million, and spent $462.1 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat amount is spread over a wide range of border operations, not just Ranger recon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLegislative Budget Board spokesman John Barton found us figures for the totals spent on Ranger border security operations in 2009 ($0.4 million) and 2010-11 ($2.6 million). Of that, Barton said, $1.8 million was spent in 2010-11 to create 10 Ranger recon team positions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to state budgets, there were no dollars appropriated specifically for border operations by Rangers in 2006-07; such appropriations in subsequent years were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Bill_80/8_FSU/80-8_FSU_1007.pdf\">2008-09</a>: $982,595 for five officers&rsquo; salaries and costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Bill_81/6_FSU/Bill-81-6_FSU_0909.pdf\">2010-11</a>: $2.8 million -- $1.8 million for 10 new Ranger positions; $1 million for five officers&rsquo; salaries and costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Bill_82/4_Conference/prtHB1_Conference_2011_SIG_Engross.pdf\">2012-13</a>: From $38.9 million in border security funds and $48.9 million in local border security, an unspecified amount for Ranger positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe State Auditor&rsquo;s Office said in a <a href=\"http://www.sao.state.tx.us/reports/main/09-022.pdf\">2009 report</a> that as of Nov. 30, 2008, Texas had spent just over half the dollars set aside for border security in<a href=\"http://www.sao.state.tx.us/reports/main/09-022.html\"> 2006-09</a> -- that is, $79 million of the $142.3 million appropriated in those two budgets. However, the audit says, between $7.6 million and &nbsp;$10 million was spent outside the border on officers, new vehicles, radio security devices and a helicopter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo although more than $140 million was targeted for border security in 2006-2009 budgets, not all made it to the border. Spokesman Michael Stiernberg told us the auditor&rsquo;s office has not examined more recent spending.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s tote up what we have. Texas has spent more than $1.8 million on Ranger recon teams, but well below $400 million. So when Perry uses a formulation like &quot;$400 million &hellip; in the form of Ranger recon teams,&quot; he&rsquo;s way off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we closed out this research, Nashed said Perry consistently says the $400 million was spent on border security overall, but at the Hampton stop, he left out some of what that spending has covered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe agree. And while we could not pin precisely how much has been spent on the border reconnaissance teams, we&rsquo;re comfortable concluding it&rsquo;s nowhere near the $400 million aired by the governor.
