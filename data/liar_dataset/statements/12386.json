That&#39;s 96 animals a day!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it true that elephants are killed at the rate it takes to down a cup of joe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimate is derived from a reputable academic study, but IFAW is oversimplifying the complexities of that research to score a good soundbite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Every 15 minutes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beth Allgood, IFAW&rsquo;s director for U.S. campaigns, told us the 96 elephants figure comes from a 2014 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/36/13117.full\">study</a> that provided the <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140818-elephants-africa-poaching-cites-census/\">first reliable</a> continent-wide estimate of illegal kills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers used data at carcass-monitoring field sites maintained by <a href=\"https://cites.org\">CITES</a> (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to model the Africa-wide number of illegal elephant deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study determined the percentage of elephants estimated to be killed by poaching. It then took that percentage and applied it to current estimates of the total number of African elephant&nbsp;species total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study used <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/36/13117/T1.expansion.html\">two different approaches</a> to calculate the total number of African elephants killed over three years &mdash; reaching 99,997 in one version and 101,784 in the other. (For context, the entire species had an estimated population size of <a href=\"http://www.elephantdatabase.org/preview_report/2013_africa_final/2013/Africa\">420,000 to 650,000</a> in 2012.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Averaged over three years, that&rsquo;s an annual rate of 33,630 elephants, researchers said. That&#39;s&nbsp;a daily rate of 92 elephants (not 96) or the equivalent of one elephant illegally poached every 15 to 16 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spoke to the lead author of the study, George Wittemyer of Colorado State University, about his findings and the IFAW claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wittemyer said the IFAW calculation was &quot;plausible,&quot; but he also said that &quot;confidence intervals around the numbers are a bit wide.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, IFAW is taking a fairly shaky estimate and describing it as a certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The better take-away from the paper is the order of magnitude (tens of thousands of elephants killed per year), rather than&nbsp;exact figures, said Julian Blanc, the data analyst for CITES&rsquo; elephant monitoring program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I therefore cannot vouch for the &lsquo;96 elephants a day&rsquo; figure,&quot; Blanc told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About that coffee comparison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether that translates to one elephant &quot;by the time you drink your coffee&quot; depends on if you sip or chug. Yes, we understand the line is a rhetorical flourish, but hey, we&rsquo;re fact-checkers so we conducted an unscientific <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PolitiFact/status/730766239870652416\">Twitter poll</a> to gauge caffeination speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250\" src=\"http://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/PolitiFact/status/730766239870652416\" width=\"550\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of nearly 2,200 respondents, a third said it takes them 15 minutes to finish their java. For these coffee drinkers, that does correspond to one elephant poached by the time they&rsquo;re done. But for a third of respondents who drink faster, the claim doesn&rsquo;t hold up. &nbsp;And for the other third who were more indolent, the claim actually lowballs the amount of elephant deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ivory and elephants</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/elephants/african_elephants/afelephants_threats/\">Various</a> <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/africa/explore/ivory-questions.xml\">wildlife</a> <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12392/0#sectionThreats\">groups</a> list demand for ivory as one of, if not the, main reason for the decimation of African elephants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But recent reports suggest poaching may be on the decline, which may push this coffee factoid further from reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Europeans began colonizing Africa in the 1800s, there were an estimated&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nationalgeographic.org/media/history-ivory-trade/\">26 million</a> elephants before the world gained an appetite for their tusks. Americans consumed 200 tons of ivory &mdash; used to make combs, art, pool balls and piano keys &mdash; per year in the early part of the 20th century and the elephant population had declined to an estimated <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/program/battle-elephants/\">10 million</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the first comprehensive survey of the species conducted by zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the population had dwindled to <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20121206134841/http://www.savetheelephants.org/files/pdf/publications/1979%20Douglas-Hamilton%20African%20Elephant%20Ivory%20Trade%20Study.pdf\">1.3 million</a> in 1979 and fell to <a href=\"http://savetheelephants.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2012IDHCongressHearing.pdf\">600,000</a> within a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This poaching crisis, said Allgood of the IFAW, led CITES to ban the international ivory trade in 1989. Then the overall elephant population rebounded from just <a href=\"http://www.elephantdatabase.org/report/1995/Africa\">286,000</a> in 1995 to <a href=\"http://www.elephantdatabase.org/report/2007/Africa\">472,000</a> in 2007 before a resurgence of the crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxJew1M1deYqF2TmvKJ7l9Hyh_-TmB5EgoYRb0ENCk8/pubchart?oid=1885472816&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.cites.org/sites/default/files/common/resources/pub/Elephants_in_the_dust.pdf\">CITES report</a>, illegal ivory trade activity and the weight of the ivory more than doubled since 2007 as a result of rising demand from growing Asian economies. The area hardest hit has been Central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, where illegal sales help fund <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/tracking-ivory/map.html\">war</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2015/aug/30/case-proven-ivory-trafficking-funds-terrorism\">terrorism</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the outlook looks slightly brighter for elephants as killings have declined <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/african_elephants_still_in_decline_due_to_high_levels_of_poaching_03032016\">since the peak in 2011</a>, CITES reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s important to note for two reasons. First, the <em>Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences</em> <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/36/13117.full\">study</a> cited by IFAW includes the peak year of 2011. Second, a decline in more recent years would knock down the total number of elephants poached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, China, the world&rsquo;s biggest ivory consumer, and the United States <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-to-ban-ivory-trade-within-a-year-or-so-as-pressure-mounts-on-hong-kong/2015/10/21/4c96c5e4-7683-11e5-a5e2-40d6b2ad18dd_story.html\">agreed</a> to enact a complete ban on ivory in the fall of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly said, &quot;By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group behind this claim, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, is trying to draw attention to a real problem by boiling down complex research into a simple-to-use factoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they are testing limits of the research they&rsquo;re citing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study measured three years and estimated that about 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers in that time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts caution against taking those figures -- which rely on estimates -- and boiling them down in the way IFAW did.
