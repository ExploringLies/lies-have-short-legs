Since then, he has pushed to expand access to pre-kindergarten as well. And <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/shows/morning-shift/mayor-emanuel-proposes-free-preschool-for-entire-city/bb794f3c-73b6-444d-abb2-fb29366b1e90\">this spring</a>, he announced plans for achieving free, full-day pre-K for all four-year-olds by 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it caught our attention when Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown, one of a large crop of potential candidates looking to challenge the mayor in next year&rsquo;s city election, declared preschool in Chicago has slipped under Emanuel&rsquo;s watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We need to have a funded pre-K,&quot; Brown said during <a href=\"https://wgnradio.com/2018/07/15/cook-county-circuit-clerk-dorothy-brown-on-her-race-for-chicago-mayor/\">a WGN radio interview</a>. &quot;Pre-K has gone down since the current mayor took office. By the time children get to the first grade, they&rsquo;re already behind if they have not had pre-K.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s provocative statement offered little by way of context and left a number of questions hanging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did she mean preschool funding had decreased? That enrollment had fallen? Or was she suggesting the program overall was spiraling?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">A numbers argument</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for Brown&rsquo;s campaign said Brown was referring to overall pre-K enrollment figures and pointed us to a Chicago Teachers Union <a href=\"https://www.ctunet.com/media/press-releases/emanuel-promises-fails-to-deliver-on-early-childhood\">press release</a> published in May following Emanuel&rsquo;s announcement that he plans to roll out universal full-day preschool for all four-year-olds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CTU, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/chicago-mayoral-race-2016-eduction-115215\">a longtime adversary</a> of the mayor&rsquo;s, blasted Emanuel for allowing enrollment to slip by 18 percent since taking office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://cps.edu/SchoolData/Pages/SchoolData.aspx\">there were 19,441 preschoolers</a> enrolled at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year&mdash;4,264 fewer than there were in the 2010-11 school year at the tail end of which Emanuel became mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while the CTU&mdash;and Brown by extension&mdash;are correct about the pre-K enrollment decrease, that decline alone doesn&rsquo;t necessarily prove her broader point that CPS&rsquo; preschool program is headed in the wrong direction under Emanuel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For one thing, enrollment throughout the district has declined overall in recent years, meaning some drop in the number of preschool students isn&rsquo;t surprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Quantity vs. quality</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, though, focusing on that enrollment decrease alone doesn&rsquo;t account for a significant&mdash;and positive&mdash;change in Chicago&rsquo;s preschool landscape that has occurred since Emanuel took office in 2011. Back then, full-day pre-K programs run by the district were virtually nonexistent, according to Arthur Reynolds, an early-education expert at the University of Minnesota who has studied full-day preschool in Chicago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increase in the number of spaces available inside full-day preschool classrooms since 2012 is &quot;enormous,&quot; Reynolds wrote in an email. &quot;Now this is the model for the city.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, full-day public pre-K slots have risen by roughly 75 percent since Emanuel took office, according to the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the mayor&rsquo;s office also noted that spots in such programs are now in greater demand than those in part-day programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Under Mayor Emanuel&rsquo;s leadership, Chicago has shifted its approach to offer as many full-day opportunities as possible, because research shows that they provide a stronger academic foundation for children and better meet the needs of working families,&quot; spokeswoman Lauren Markowitz wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In pursuing that goal, Markowitz said, CPS has increased the total number of full-day seats in Chicago&#39;s public pre-K programs from about 10,000 in 2011 to more than 17,500 today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those figures include approximately 10,000 full-day seats available annually at district-authorized community-based organizations. Prior to Emanuel&rsquo;s first term, full-day programs run directly by CPS were almost nonexistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Full-day and half-day</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s with the decrease?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to ramp up the number of full-day spots, Markowitz explained, CPS has converted some classrooms that served two half-day sessions into full-day ones, which reduces the number of kids served at those locations by half. They&rsquo;ve been adding new full-day classes too, though not at a rate fast enough to counteract the overall decline in capacity at CPS-operated programs, which pencils out to about 14 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/shows/morning-shift/mayor-emanuel-proposes-free-preschool-for-entire-city/bb794f3c-73b6-444d-abb2-fb29366b1e90\">But many education experts agree</a>, as the mayor&rsquo;s office contends, that the benefits of high-quality, full-day preschool programs are worth investing in, even though overall enrollment may fall in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1938567?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=\">In a 2014 study</a> of children attending preschool at child-parent centers that serve low-income communities in Chicago, for instance, Reynolds and his colleagues found full-day preschool was associated with higher levels of school readiness and better attendance than half-day programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In light of the research guiding the mayor&rsquo;s plan, we followed up with Brown to clarify her stance on full-day preschool expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her spokeswoman sent a statement from the candidate that attempted to have it both ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Any decrease in the numbers of our children able to access high-quality early educational options is unacceptable,&quot; Brown&rsquo;s statement said. &quot;I am supportive of full-day preschool because it will set the bar for their entire educational experience.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While knocking Emanuel&rsquo;s education record, Brown said &quot;pre-K has gone down since the current mayor took office.&quot; When we sought clarity, her campaign pointed to a decline in preschool enrollment during Emanuel&rsquo;s tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s correct on that count, but the number of enrolled preschoolers isn&rsquo;t the best way to assess the overall health of Chicago&rsquo;s pre-K programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the district&rsquo;s population as a whole has dropped during that period, likely contributing to that decrease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, available spots in full-day preschool programs have increased by 75 percent under Emanuel, and many parents are snapping them up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of that expansion process, some part-day classrooms have been converted to full-day ones, cutting the total number of students those rooms can serve. But research supports investing in full-day preschool programming, especially for lower-income children, because it helps better prepare them for school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s campaign pointed us to numbers that are technically accurate but don&rsquo;t tell the full story.
