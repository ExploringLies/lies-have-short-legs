The first dispensary opened in December 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if the ad&rsquo;s claim about U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors checked out, especially given the <a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/state/report-continued-delays-for-veterans-at-phoenix-va-system\">continued delays for health care</a> at the Phoenix VA Health Care System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cannabis concessions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prohibition is outlined in the <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=2362\">VA&rsquo;s 2011 directive</a> on medical marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is VHA policy to prohibit VA providers from completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veteran&rsquo;s participation in a state marijuana program.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana is a <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml\">Schedule I drug</a>, which means it cannot be used for medical purposes and has high potential for abuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DEA has a five-schedule drug scale -- the higher the number, the less dangerous. However, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/us/marijuana-legalization-ballot-measures.html?_r=0\">25 states</a> have already legalized medical marijuana. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Andrew Saxon of the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle said federal health care systems have to obey federal laws. Marijuana is still illegal federally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a veteran could still receive VA health care -- as the 2011 directive notes -- and seek medical marijuana elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A military veteran who is eligible for VA health care cannot be refused those services if he/she is using medical marijuana authorized by a non-VA health care provider,&quot; Saxon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislation on amending the VA&rsquo;s policy has&nbsp;come up short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, an amendment to the VA&rsquo;s budget bill would have allowed VA doctors to recommend medical marijuana to veterans in states where it&rsquo;s legal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the amendment <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/high-hopes-dashed-for-pot-amendment-that-passed-house-and-senate\">was removed</a> from the spending bill, which eventually passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad claimed, &quot;VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s on the mark. Veterans can still seek medical marijuana on their own -- where it&rsquo;s legal -- and VA health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the ad&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/265a5a2c-d11f-4e67-b132-57d62130cff1\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/265a5a2c-d11f-4e67-b132-57d62130cff1</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-25T15:28:43.814206", "ruling_date": "2016-10-26T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Are VA doctors barred from recommending medical marijuana to veterans?
