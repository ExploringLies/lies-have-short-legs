Citizens for Fairness, an electioneering communications organization based in Melbourne, produced the ad. Efforts to reach the group&#39;s chairperson, Carmella K. Falcone, were unsuccessful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&#39;t rate whether Murphy is trustworthy &quot;with our money&quot; on the Truth-O-Meter, but voters may find her <a href=\"http://doe.dos.state.fl.us/PublicRecordsBER/wfPublicImagesBER.aspx?account=60874\">financial disclosures</a> informative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Division of Elections&nbsp;reports indicate she earned $176,047 last year as an investment adviser at Raymond James Financial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She earns well more than the average Pasco resident. Her income is roughly three times higher than the $51,000 median family income in Pasco, according to U.S. Census data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her biggest asset is her house in New Port Richey, valued at $157,480. Based on August sales data, her home is worth about 65 percent more than the average New Port Richey home valued at about $95,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s where the ad veers from the truth: Murphy&#39;s net worth is listed as $243,817 and includes a $12,900 timeshare in a Cocoa Beach condominium and half a timeshare worth $7,362 in a condo in Cabo San Lucas on Mexico&#39;s Baja California peninsula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A time share &mdash; which typically entitles the owner to a week or two of use of the space each year &mdash; is hardly comparable to owning a second (or third) home in a pricey vacation spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the claim she has &quot;two vacation homes around the world,&quot; including in Cancun, is misleading. It suggests Murphy owns the homes when in fact she owns a time share in a Florida condo and half a share in a condo in Cabo San Lucas &mdash; not in Cancun, which is on the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula about 1,480 miles to the east.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the ad calls Murphy a &quot;Wall Street broker,&quot; suggesting she works among the financial giants far removed the problems of Pasco voters. It&#39;s true Raymond James is a brokerage, but it&#39;s a regional brokerage based in St. Petersburg, not in New York City. Murphy works out of the company&#39;s Tampa office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad attempts to portray Murphy as an out-of-touch millionaire but uses flimsy evidence to support that picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-12T11:32:21.054905", "ruling_date": "2013-10-12T11:24:34", "ruling_headline": "Campaign mailer says Amanda Murphy has \"two vacation homes around the world\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "campaign-mailer-says-amanda-murphy-has-two-vacatio", "ruling_link_text": "Glitzing up two time shares", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Campaign mailer obtained by the<em>&nbsp;Tampa Bay Times</em>, Oct. 9,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Division of Elections, <a href=\"http://doe.dos.state.fl.us/PublicRecordsBER/wfPublicImagesBER.aspx?account=60874\">financial disclosure reports</a> for Amanda Murphy</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/local/democrat-murphy-to-run-for-house-36-seat-to-replace-fasano/2137609\">Democrat Murphy to run for House 36 seat to replace Fasano</a>,&nbsp;Aug. 21, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 2457, "last_name": "Citizens for Fairness", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "citizens-fairness", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-independent_groups.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mug-independentgroup__________________16.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2457/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Amanda Murphy has &quot;two vacation homes around the world.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a campaign mailer", "statement_date": "2013-10-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
