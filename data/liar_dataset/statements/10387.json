Emerson said the zones exist in France and throughout the rest of Europe as &quot;safe havens&quot; for Muslims ruled by Sharia courts and not a country&rsquo;s own laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In Britain, it&rsquo;s not just no-go zones,&quot; Emerson said. &quot;There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim, where non-Muslims just simply don&rsquo;t go in. And parts of London, there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn&#39;t dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Western Europe is just not dealing with the situation, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Western Europe, meanwhile, did not seem amused by his comment. And make no mistake, the claim is wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city of Birmingham, situated north and west of London, has more than 1 million residents. There are more whites and Christians than any other ethnicity or religion, we found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a report of the 2011 UK Census by the <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1223542567160&amp;ssbinary=true&amp;blobheadervalue1=attachment%3B+filename%3D3186762011_Census_population_and_migration_topic_report.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Birmingham City Council,</u></a> 46 percent of residents said they were Christian and 22 percent, or 234,111 people, identified as Muslim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt, Islam is a growing and popular faith in Birmingham, up 7.5 percentage points from 2001 to 2011. Three Birmingham wards, Heath, Bordesley Green&nbsp;and Sparkbrook, had Muslim populations that exceeded half of the population,&nbsp;all ranging from 70 percent to about 77 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that this gives any credence to Emerson&rsquo;s claim about the city of Birmingham as a whole. This does not amount to the city &quot;being totally Muslim.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emerson apologized on his website and on the BBC, among other forums, for his remarks. He attributed his statement about Birmingham to sloppy fact-checking. (No kidding.) Here is the <a href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/4730/emerson-with-judge-pirro-no-go-islamic-zones#\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>apology</u></a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error. And I am issuing this apology and correction for having made this comment about the beautiful city of Birmingham. I do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that I had relied on other sources because I should have been much more careful. There was no excuse for making this mistake and I owe an apology to every resident of Birmingham. &nbsp;I am not going to make any excuses. I made an inexcusable error. And I am obligated to openly acknowledge that mistake. &nbsp;I wish to apologize for all residents of that great city of Birmingham.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>Steve Emerson</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>PS. I am making (a) donation to Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron, who really did <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/central/update/2015-01-12/prime-minister-steven-emerson-is-clearly-an-idiot/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>say the remark caused him to choke on his porridge,</u></a> called Emerson a &quot;complete idiot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He started with an apology,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;That&#39;s not a bad start. But what he should do is look at Birmingham and see what a fantastic example it is bringing people together of different faiths and different backgrounds and building a world-class brilliant city with a great and strong economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A note about Emerson&rsquo;s other point, that in parts of London there are &quot;actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn&#39;t dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire.&quot; While there are no official Muslim religious police, there have been some reports of &quot;Muslim patrols&quot; or &quot;Sharia patrols&quot; <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2519519/Muslim-Patrol-jailed-harassing-couple-holding-hands-men-drinking-bid-enforce-Sharia-law-East-London.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>trying to make people in parts of East London follow Islamic law</u></a>, and three people were jailed for doing so in 2013. But there&rsquo;s little information to suggest the patrols are widespread or involve many people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emerson said Birmingham is a city in England that is totally Muslim, &quot;where non-Muslims just simply don&rsquo;t go in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has&nbsp;since admitted that is inaccurate, and for good reason. The stats say Birmingham is about 20 percent Muslim. All that is left to say is Emerson&rsquo;s statement rates&nbsp;Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-01-14T12:04:43.206887", "ruling_date": "2015-01-14T12:28:23", "ruling_headline": "Fox News guest Steven Emerson says Birmingham is 'totally Muslim'", "ruling_headline_slug": "fox-news-guest-steven-emerson-says-birmingham-tota", "ruling_link_text": "Emerson blames sloppy research", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Emerson <a href=\"http://www.investigativeproject.org/4730/emerson-with-judge-pirro-no-go-islamic-zones#\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>apology</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Birmingham City Council Census report, <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1223542567160&amp;ssbinary=true&amp;blobheadervalue1=attachment%3B+filename%3D3186762011_Census_population_and_migration_topic_report.pdf\">October 2013</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Executive director of The Investigative Project on Terrorism", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Steven", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 3039, "last_name": "Emerson", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "steven-emerson", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/emerson3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3039/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.steveemerson.com/about/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;There are actual cities&quot; like Birmingham, England, &quot;that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don&rsquo;t go in.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on Fox News", "statement_date": "2015-01-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 9, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/9/", "subject": "Religion", "subject_slug": "religion", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
