He didn&rsquo;t say what the protesting players should be doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But less than a month later, the Republican governor, who is widely expected to run for a third term in 2018, was sending a different message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which means it&rsquo;s time to turn to our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/about/\">Flip-O-Meter</a>, which assesses whether a politician has been consistent on an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three Walker statements, and a mobilization effort, are key. They show the governor pivoting from a hands-off position to telling the NFL players exactly what they should do during the anthem. He also suggested the players instead take a stand against domestic violence, even though the protests have centered on racial inequality and police brutality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. &lsquo;They should have to explain&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tmj4.com/news/gov-scott-walker-on-anthem-protests-ill-leave-it-up-to-them\">Walker was asked by a reporter</a> in Green Bay on Sept. 27, 2017: &quot;You don&rsquo;t find it disrespectful what&rsquo;s happening, entering this political debate to sports? He said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, again, I&rsquo;ll let others explain what they&rsquo;re doing it and why they&rsquo;re doing it. I just know in my household, my kids were always taught, as I was always taught, you stand and put your hand over your heart &hellip;.Now, part of those rights are the right to protest, so others can do that. But then they should have to explain why they&rsquo;re doing that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, he made no direct statement to what players who had been protesting should do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. &lsquo;Time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2017/10/16/file_attachments/896888/10.16.17%2BGov.%2BWalker%2BLetter%2Bto%2Bthe%2BNFL%2Band%2BNFLPA.pdf\">In a letter Walker sent to the NFL and its players union</a>, Oct. 16, 2017, Walker wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A lot has been made about National Football League players protesting by kneeling, remaining in the locker room, or other means during the national anthem. Speaking up for what&nbsp;you believe in is a profoundly American idea, but disrespecting our flag, and the men and&nbsp;women who have fought to protect and defend our country, is not American in the slightest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem and move on from what has become a divisive political sideshow &hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My request is simple: Stand for the American flag and the national anthem out of respect for those who risk their lives for our freedoms, and then take a stand against domestic violence to keep American families safe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker then repeated his call for the protests to end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s simple: Stand up&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/5621724561001/?playlist_id=930909787001#sp=show-clips\">interview on the&nbsp;&quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; talk show</a> on the Fox News Channel on Oct. 23, 2017, Walker said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the NFL, it&rsquo;s simple: Stand up, put your hand over your heart. Do what Americans are taught to do, like we were taught to do in my family and I passed on to my kids. When the national anthem is played, stand up and show respect for the men and women who are currently in harm&rsquo;s way, as well as all those great veterans who fought for that flag. If you want to speak out on something else, do it at a different time in a different platform &hellip;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Mobilization</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days after the Fox interview, Walker&rsquo;s campaign announced an <a href=\"https://my.scottwalker.com/send-a-message-to-the-nfl/\">online petition</a> and digital ad campaign &quot;to build pressure on the NFL and its players to stop protesting the national anthem and flag.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Walker had gone from not directly addressing the players who were protesting to trying to mobilize Americans against them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Worth noting</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Walker has made it a point to underscore his new position. The anthem controversy had begun to die down when Walker took the step of sending his letter. And Walker&rsquo;s campaign organization highlighted the governor&rsquo;s statements about it on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends,&quot; issuing <a href=\"https://www.scottwalker.com/press/icymi-governor-walker-joined-fox-friends-urge-nfl-players-stand-national-anthem/\">a news release</a> saying that he had &quot;urged&quot; players to stand, and starting the mobilization effort.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>There appears to be a wider political connection. The day after Walker released his letter, the Republican Governors Association, of which Walker is chairman, sent out a fundraising solicitation announcing <a href=\"https://give.victorypassport.com/rga/i-stand-cc/\">&quot;I Stand&quot; bumper stickers</a> were available in exchange for a campaign contribution to the association. The email says the stickers are available for a donation of $5 or more. The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now <a href=\"http://onewisconsinnow.org/press/gov-scott-walkers-reverse-field-on-national-anthem-comes-with-fundraising-pitch/\">pointed out the timing</a>.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker initially didn&rsquo;t tell NFL players what they should do, but he did note the right to protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than a month later, he said: &quot;It is time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem,&quot; and he asked the players to stand during the pre-game playing of the anthem. Then Walker went further, saying: &quot;For the NFL, it&rsquo;s simple. Stand up, put your hand over your heart.&quot; Finally, his campaign launched an online petition and digital ad campaign to pressure the players to stop their protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Flip-O-Meter, our ratings are No Flip, Half Flip or Full Flop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a partial change in position, we give Walker a Half Flip.</p> div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-10-24T12:34:03.246876", "ruling_date": "2017-10-25T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker veers on NFL national anthem protests", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-flips-hard-nfl-protests", "ruling_link_text": "Went from hands-off to activist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WTMJ-TV, <a href=\"http://www.tmj4.com/news/gov-scott-walker-on-anthem-protests-ill-leave-it-up-to-them\">video of Scott Walker talking with reporters</a>, Sept. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Scott Walker press secretary Tom Evenson, Oct. 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News Channel, <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/5621724561001/?playlist_id=930909787001#sp=show-clips\">&quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; Scott Walker interview</a>, Oct. 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governor&rsquo;s office, <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2017/10/16/file_attachments/896888/10.16.17%2BGov.%2BWalker%2BLetter%2Bto%2Bthe%2BNFL%2Band%2BNFLPA.pdf\">Scott Walker letter to NFL and players union</a>, Oct. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Wisconsin Now, <a href=\"http://onewisconsinnow.org/press/gov-scott-walkers-reverse-field-on-national-anthem-comes-with-fundraising-pitch/\">&quot;Gov.
