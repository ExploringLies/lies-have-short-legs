But it is not at an all-time low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unemployment rate has been lower several times since 1976, right up to the burst of the housing bubble in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad cites a March <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/four-states-hit-record-low-unemployment-in-february\">Washington Examiner</a></em> story.

Texas is near record-low unemployment. Florida unemployment, at 3.9 percent, is near as low as it&#39;s ever been outside the years of the housing bubble.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to get a better understanding of Florida&rsquo;s unemployment history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s unemployment rate has held at 3.9 percent since September 2017 through March 2018, the latest month for which we have data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We confirmed that Florida&rsquo;s unemployment rate has been lower than or equal to 3.9 percent several times in the last 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We counted 43&nbsp;months from 1998 to 2018 with unemployment rates below 3.9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In late 1999 and early 2000, Florida&rsquo;s unemployment was between 3.7 to 3.9 percent, based on seasonally adjusted data.
