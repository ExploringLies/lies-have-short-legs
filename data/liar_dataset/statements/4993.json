Moreover, the Madison think tank&rsquo;s video included a clip from the meeting in which Government Accountability Board members and staff talked about Disney&rsquo;s most famous character and history&rsquo;s most famous dictator.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tWould their signatures really be accepted on Walker recall petitions?<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tA pivotal word here is accept.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tMacIver&rsquo;s statement suggests that such signatures not only will be accepted by the state but also counted toward the more than <a href=\"http://gab.wi.gov/elections-voting/recall/governor\">540,000</a> signatures needed to force a recall election in 2012. Indeed, the narrator in the video claimed the board had said all signatures listed with a Wisconsin address &quot;will be counted.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tTwo points emerged from the video&rsquo;s clip of the discussion between a Government Accountability Board member and board staffers:<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>1. </strong>A signature with a name that does not include a Wisconsin address would automatically be stricken.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tA staff member noted that the name of Adolf Hitler was stricken from a petition submitted in the state Senate recalls in the summer of 2011 because the address listed was Berlin, Germany.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>2.</strong> A signature bearing a name such as Mickey Mouse would not automatically be stricken if it is listed with a Wisconsin address -- but it would be &quot;flagged&quot; for additional review.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThe board has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gab-will-seek-more-time-to-review-any-recall-petitions-that-are-filed-lf3e5ge-135517743.html\">said</a> each signature will initially be reviewed by two people -- staff members of the board or temporary workers hired to review the petitions.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tBut, as we reported in a recent <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/02/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-its-legal-sign-walker-recal/\">item</a> about signing recall petitions multiple times, the board has said it will only do a general review of the names and that for a signature to be stricken it must be formally challenged by Walker. <a href=\"http://www.scottwalker.org/verify\">Walker</a> and <a href=\"http://verifytherecall.com/\">two tea party groups</a> are assembling teams to review petitions for possible challenges. <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/285875/wisconsin-s-mickey-mouse-recall-process-christian-schneider\">Some conservatives</a>, however, fear it will be difficult to detect duplicate signatures and signatures for bogus but common-sounding names.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t(Two days after the video posting, Walker and the Republican Party of Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.wisgop.org/sites/default/files/RPW_COMPLAINT_GAB.pdf\">sued</a> the board over its procedures, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/assembly-leader-wants-to-replace-state-elections-agency-5u3f2or-135669843.html\">asking</a> a judge to order the board, which is composed of <a href=\"http://gab.wi.gov/about/members\">six former judges</a>, to look for and eliminate duplicate signatures, clearly fake names and illegible addresses.)<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tWe asked MacIver Institute spokesman <a href=\"http://maciverinstitute.com/contact-us/\">Brian Fraley</a> if he had &nbsp;evidence beyond the video to back the group&rsquo;s claim. He said he did not.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tSo, Mickey Mouse and Hitler signatures listed with an address in Wisconsin would be accepted in the sense that they would not be immediately rejected if spotted by GAB workers.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tBut such signatures would actually be counted only if the apparently fictitious signatures went undetected -- by board workers, Walker representatives and other petition reviewers. Once detected, Walker could ask the board to strike those signatures. The board would decide the challenges at a <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=255854\">public meeting</a>.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tNews reports about Mickey Mouse and Hitler signatures led the Government Accountability Board to issue a <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=255854\">statement</a> the next day about its process for handling &quot;potentially fictitious&quot; names. Two key points from the statement:<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>1.</strong> Recall committees have an incentive to strike fictitious names before submitting their petitions to try and ensure they have collected enough valid signatures. To be valid, a signature must be from a person who is <a href=\"http://gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/publication/65/recall_manual_for_congressiona_county_and_state__82919.pdf\">qualified </a>(though not necessarily registered) to vote in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tGraeme Zielinski, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gab-will-seek-more-time-to-review-any-recall-petitions-that-are-filed-lf3e5ge-135517743.html\">said</a>the recall committees will strike obviously fictitious names.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>2.</strong> In challenging signatures, Walker can submit evidence to back the challenges. And the Government Accountability Board can use resources such as voter registration lists in deciding whether to strike a signature.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThe MacIver Institute said &quot;Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures&quot; -- suggesting such signatures would automatically be counted toward the number needed to force Walker into a recall election.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tFor such signatures to actually be counted, they would have to pass undetected through petition circulators, the recall committees, a pair of Government Accountability Board reviewers, Walker&rsquo;s representatives and other groups that review the petitions. If such signatures were found, Walker could formally challenge them to the board to get them stricken.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThere&rsquo;s an element of truth in MacIver&rsquo;s statement in that fictitious signatures listed with Wisconsin addresses would be accepted -- but only for review. The statement, however, ignores critical facts -- namely that the signatures would have to pass through several layers of review to actually be counted.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThat&rsquo;s our definition of Mostly False.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-16T13:15:35.915537", "ruling_date": "2011-12-18T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Conservative group says Wisconsin to allow Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures on petitions to recall Gov.
