Some of his posts go viral, presumably boosting his standing with Google&rsquo;s news algorithm. The fake news posts typically earn Horner -- according to an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/17/facebook-fake-news-writer-i-think-donald-trump-is-in-the-white-house-because-of-me/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_fake-news-845a%3Ahomepage%2Fstory\">interview</a> with the <em>Washington Post</em> -- $10,000 a month in ad sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <em>Post </em>interview, Horner took credit for the fake news item about the protester being paid $3,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;His followers don&rsquo;t fact-check anything &mdash; they&rsquo;ll post everything, believe anything,&quot; Horner said. Referring to then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Horner said, &quot;His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.&quot; Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of Lewandowski&rsquo;s since-deleted tweet:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Jnjt0jGoC45aCDKJ6NQEN872QYSVwByDUnimShScZtrn1oC2FSHOCbPfgfYJnTNsEN-cAKz4ecX3oR4Vty4D2rAorcIvTxsxiCb92eP3P5zx3xM1hcQbDno-lOjP5NhZETBqOQRw\" style=\"border:none; height:346px; width:590px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked by the <em>Post</em>&rsquo;s Caitlin Dewey why he posted the fake story, Horner responded, &quot;Just &rsquo;cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that&rsquo;s just insane. I&rsquo;ve gone to Trump protests &mdash; trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story&rsquo;s high position on Google search results after the election likely stems from Horner&rsquo;s decision to re-date the post, which originally ran in March. The current version is dated Nov. 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automated algorithms may not be able to tell fact from fiction, but a human with minimal understanding of typical news articles might have noticed, after clicking into it, that the article eventually degenerates into a rant against Snopes.com, the urban-legends site that has <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/\">regularly debunked</a> articles from websites operated by Horner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Horner even quoted himself by name in the fake story, something he does in many of his posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has also debunked <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/16/blog-posting/viral-post-claims-barack-obama-has-begun-nationwid/\">at least</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/23/chain-email/rumors-third-barack-obama-term-are-satire-passed-t/\">three</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/16/blog-posting/did-vermont-pastor-get-sentenced-prison-refusing-m/\">fake</a> Horner stories in recent years.
