Intelligence officials feared Page was a potential Russian agent, or the target of Moscow&#39;s&nbsp;recruiting efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Twitter, Trump&nbsp;claimed the surveillance application proves the Steele dossier launched the Russia probe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1021341698734030848?s=21\">tweeted</a> July 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put simply, Trump is wrong about the triggering event. The Steele dossier did not launch the FBI&rsquo;s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dossier was used, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/28/democrats-memo-pushes-back-gop-claims-about-russia/\">to some extent</a>, to persuade a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court to authorize surveillance of Page. But it was the actions of another Trump campaign adviser &mdash; George Papadopoulos &mdash; that actually started the investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump adviser George Papadopoulos triggered investigation</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government started looking into Russian election involvement in July 2016 based on information from Papadopoulos. This was confirmed by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok,&quot; the House Intelligence Committee&rsquo;s GOP members wrote in a Feb. 2 <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4365340/Read-the-GOP-memo.pdf\">memo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Intelligence Committee Republicans confirmed in an April <a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/us/politics/20180427%20Intelligence%20Committee%20Report.pdf#page=57\">report</a> it was Papadopoulos who set the FBI investigation in motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what was the &quot;Papadopoulos information&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\">New York Times</a>, Papadopoulos told a high-ranking Australian diplomat at an upscale London bar in May 2016 that Moscow had &quot;political dirt&quot; on Hillary Clinton.

Yet an entire year would pass before Mueller entered the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Justice Department did not <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download\">appoint</a> Mueller to take over the FBI investigation until May 2017, roughly a week after Trump fired FBI director James Comey.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the Steele dossier &quot;was responsible for starting&quot; Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Steele dossier did not trigger Mueller&rsquo;s investigation. It was information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that set the probe in motion. Also, Mueller did not take up the investigation until roughly a year after the triggering event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-23T11:00:46.676850", "ruling_date": "2018-07-23T11:31:43", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump falsely says new Carter Page documents show Steele dossier launched Russia probe ", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-falsely-says-new-carter-page-document", "ruling_link_text": "Gets cause wrong", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1021341698734030848?s=21\">Tweet</a> from President Donald Trump, July 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FISA <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4614732/D1Release.pdf\">application</a> for Carter Page, released July 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/28/democrats-memo-pushes-back-gop-claims-about-russia/\">Democrats&rsquo; memo pushes back on GOP claims about Russia probe</a>,&quot; Feb. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jul/16/russia-investigation-donald-trump-timeline-updated/\">The Russia investigation and Donald Trump: a timeline from on-the-record sources</a>,&quot; July 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html\">How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt</a>,&quot; Dec. 30, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says the Steele dossier &quot;was responsible for starting&quot; Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a tweet", "statement_date": "2018-07-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Trump falsely says Steele dossier triggered Russia probe"}
