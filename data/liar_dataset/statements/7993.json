John Kasich ratified on June 30, they sense a political opening on the women&rsquo;s issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewers of MSNBC&rsquo;s &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; recently got a preview of the heated rhetoric that will typify this debate over the next 16 months as Kasich seeks a second term. Maddow, the cable news program&rsquo;s liberal host, noted on her June 28 broadcast the anti-abortion measures the GOP-controlled General Assembly had added to the budget, which Kasich had yet to sign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In interpreting some of the budget&rsquo;s more-ambiguous abortion language, Maddow contended that the new regulations included a &quot;mandatory vaginal probe at the insistence of the state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maddow was referring to a new requirement that women seeking abortions first receive ultrasounds to determine whether a fetal heartbeat is present. Her provocative words quickly went viral and sent PolitiFact Ohio in search of a full copy of the massive state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did it go as far as she claimed? Did it mandate a transvaginal ultrasound, as Maddow claimed, or did it allow for an external transabdominal procedure? We found our answer in the new Section 2919.191 that with the budget&rsquo;s approval is now part of Ohio Revised Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Division A of that section says that before performing an abortion, a provider must &quot;determine whether there is a detectable fetal heartbeat of the unborn human individual the pregnant woman is carrying.&quot; The method for detecting a heartbeat is then spelled out in Division C, which says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">The director of health may promulgate rules pursuant to section 111.15 of the Revised Code specifying the appropriate methods of performing an examination for the presence of a fetal heartbeat of an unborn individual based on standard medical practice. The rules shall require only that an examination shall be performed externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, not only are external methods such as transabdominal ultrasounds allowed under the new law; they are required. That sinks Maddow&rsquo;s claim of a &quot;mandatory vaginal probe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to MSNBC and asked representatives if Maddow had anything more to say, but we did not hear back from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Maddow is an opinion leader on the left, others ran with her claim. The Raw Story, which describes itself as a progressive news website, called attention to the Maddow segment in a June 29 post. And on Twitter, several users seemed to parrot Maddow in tweets at Kasich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nothing says Small Government like a mandated trans vaginal ultra sound,&quot; read one tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ohio Gov @JohnKasich just ended his re-election chance, by signing into law mandatory big-government-forced object-rape of pregnant women,&quot; tweeted another critic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abortion is a hot-button issue in politics. And with Kasich up for re-election next year, it&rsquo;s no surprise that Democrats are eager for a debate that draws contrasts with the governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there should be no debate about what types of ultrasounds these new regulations require. Had Maddow read the language closely, she would have seen a mandate -- for external detection methods. That puts Maddow&rsquo;s &quot;vaginal probe&quot; claim about as far as can be from the truth, into the realm of the ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOr, in Truth-O-Meter terms: Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-09T17:14:17.197879", "ruling_date": "2013-07-09T17:30:57", "ruling_headline": " Rachel Maddow says that Ohio budget includes requirement for transvaginal ultrasound", "ruling_headline_slug": "rachel-maddow-says-ohio-budget-includes-requiremen", "ruling_link_text": "Mandate opposite of what Maddow claims", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26315908/#52347201\">&quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; on MSNBC</a>(video), June 28, 2013;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcript of &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show,&quot; June 28, 2013, via LexisNexis;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Plain Dealer, via cleveland.com, <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/06/kasich_signs_budget_keeps_abor.html#incart_river\">&quot;Kasich signs budget, keeps abortion restrictions, leaves door open for Medicaid expansion,&quot;</a>June 30, 2013;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Ohio Gov.
