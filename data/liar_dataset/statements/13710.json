Gen Chris Bogdan</a> told reporters that he anticipated that costs would &quot;come down in price significantly&quot; and put the savings &quot;somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane, per variant.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/01/30/trump-says-lockheed-martin-has-cut-600-million-from-f-35-program/?tid=pm_world_pop&amp;utm_term=.1c8b3a20d5a2\">The Washington Post</a></em> calculated total savings between $549 million and $630 million for the full lot of 90 planes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his transition into office, Trump convened top military brass, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, at his estate at <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-pentagon-defense-budget-232908\">Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach</a> on Dec. 21 to discuss how to bring costs down for the F-35 program. (Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was also there. Boeing is the contractor for Air Force One, another project that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/06/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweet-air-force-one-bo/\">Trump said was too expensive</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/812061677160202240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Trump tweeted</a>: &quot;Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A week before Trump&rsquo;s inauguration, <a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article126384624.html\">Hewson</a> said her company was close to a deal to significantly lower costs after the Mar-A-Lago meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program in late January. On Feb. 3, the Defense Department announced it had reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin for a $728 million reduction, leading to the &quot;lowest priced F-35s in program history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lockheed Martin issued a <a href=\"http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/speeches/0203-f35-lrip-10-statement.html\">statement</a> praising Trump&rsquo;s involvement: &quot;President Trump&rsquo;s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That, however, is not the end of the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Costs predicted to drop for years</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense and budget experts offered a big caveat to Trump&rsquo;s claim: Costs had been coming down for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the cost reduction for the Air Force variant of the F-35 had been in the works since before Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The savings are a little higher than was initially projected, but all President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,&quot; Ellis said. &quot;He&rsquo;s not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost per plane has always been a moving target, <em>The</em> <em>Arizona Republic</em> <a href=\"http://archive.azcentral.com/news/arizona/articles/20140208fighter-plane-behind-schedule-over-budget.html\">reported in 2014</a>, and Lockheed Martin officials had said that costs had been coming down. The initial production model delivered in 2010 cost about $220 million, while the projection for 2020 ranged from $75 million-$85 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general manager of Lockheed&#39;s F-35 program, Lorraine Martin, <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/new-report-shows-slow-steady-unit-cost-drop-for-f-35-410439/\">said in 2015</a> that costs would drop further, &quot;allowing us to provide our warfighters a fifth-generation F-35 jet at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The savings can be attributed to a normal learning curve, said Todd Harrison, a military budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you build more copies of an item you naturally get more efficient at the work,&quot; he said. &quot;That is a big part of what we are seeing here, and that would have occurred regardless of who won the presidential election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Harrison said that Trump can take credit for the fact that the government was able to negotiate a deal with Lockheed so quickly for the next batch of airplanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the previous lot of F-35s, DOD negotiated with Lockheed for about a year and a half and never reached a deal,&quot; he said. &quot;DOD ultimately used a somewhat unusual method for finalizing the contract unilaterally in late 2016.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben Friedman, a military budget expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the savings have nothing to do with Trump since they were already in the works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First, there are no savings yet, as they are anticipated, perhaps hopefully,&quot; he said. &quot;Second, it is normal for costs to fall as production goes forward and problems are solved. Third, it&#39;s not as if no one before Trump was looking to cut F-35 costs. It has been a fixation in the Pentagon for a long time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Defense announced a $728 million reduction on Feb. 3 for the aircraft.
