In 2014 in the U.S., Coca Cola and Pepsi together sold 1.4 billion cases fewer than they did in 2004, <em>Fortune</em> <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/26/soda-sales-drop-2014/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reported</u></a>, the sum of &quot;modest declines&quot; for 10 years straight. <em>The Philadelphia Inquirer </em><a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/373687841.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>detailed</u></a> that Coca Cola in particular had lost $1 billion in sales each year since 2012. These drops have meant big changes for Big Soda: Investing in foreign markets, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-18/coca-cola-profit-falls-8-4-as-cost-cuts-announced\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>implementing</u></a> cost-cutting measures, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/smaller-soda-containers-mean-bigger-profits/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>bottling</u></a> drinks in smaller sizes too for higher profit margins or raising prices altogether, to name a few. <em>Beverage Digest</em> Editor Duane Stanford highlighted price hikes in an interview. &quot;Companies have increased prices for their products, so they&rsquo;ve been making money even though they&rsquo;re selling fewer beverages,&quot; he said. But! &quot;Soft drinks are still profitable,&quot; he continued. Soda corporations &quot;still have pricing power because their brands are powerful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judging how big profits have been is &quot;entirely dependent on the company themselves,&quot; said Stanford. &quot;It&rsquo;s a relative statement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big soda to some commentators refers to the carbonated drinks industry as a whole. To others, it speaks to the biggest soft-drink selling corporations in the game: Coca Cola, Pepsi and, if the bronze-level company is in the discussion, Dr. Pepper Snapple. (Kenney&rsquo;s communication director shared data on Coke, Pepsi, and Coca Cola FEMSA, the company&rsquo;s Mexico-based bottler, in response to a fact-check inquiry for this report.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coca Cola reported $7.4 billion in net income, Pepsi reported $5.5 billion and Dr. Pepper Snapple $764 million. Dr. Pepper Snapple and Coke experienced slight profit boosts over the year before, while Pepsi&rsquo;s numbers took a $1.1-billion dip. News reports on annual and quarterly reports deemed profits for all three companies better than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kenney stated that big soda makes a lot of cash. Profit-wise, despite current consumers trends that may signal a bleak future for soft drink sales, carbonated beverages remain profitable, thanks, in notable cases, to reorganization and new pricing. We rate this claim true.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-30T07:15:55.557596", "ruling_date": "2016-03-30T08:45:00", "ruling_headline": " 'Big Soda' and the profits Mayor Kenney is convinced it earns", "ruling_headline_slug": "big-soda-and-profits-mayor-kenney-convinced-it-ear", "ruling_link_text": "Soda is still a moneymaker", "ruling_state": "Pennsylvania", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>News report, <a href=\"http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/03/27/mayor-kenney-strikes-back-at-opponents-of-soda-tax/?utm_campaign=EDIT%3A+News&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=27732602&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--wRPqNnpS_yWczIZHY4GVrgrKnyygX3dfJLkitSFG-I2brtf97RT5mh6WpcAkrT2Bvd7PWQfkm9TM89xbtRV0colj9CA&amp;_hsmi=27732602\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Mayor Kenney Strikes Back At Opponents Of Soda Tax,&quot;</u></a> Pat Loeb, KYW, Mar. 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/26/soda-sales-drop-2014/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;</u><u>U.S. soda sales dropped for the 10th straight year in 2014,&quot;</u></a> John Kell, <em>Fortune</em>, Mar. 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-18/coca-cola-profit-falls-8-4-as-cost-cuts-announced\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Coca-Cola Plans $1 Billion in Cost Cuts as Profit Falls,</u></a>&quot; Duane Stanford, <em>Bloomberg</em>, Feb. 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/business/373687841.html#UdAeeMz9hIt48tTl.99\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;</u><u>Philly&#39;s soda tax is one more battle for Coke and Pepsi,&quot;</u></a> Joseph N.
