Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZeKdfxI_RA \">A recent ad by Club for Growth</a>, a conservative anti-tax group, attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Supreme Court&rsquo;s <em>Kelo </em>decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations,&quot; the ad&rsquo;s narrator says. &quot;Conservatives have fought this disaster. What&rsquo;s Donald Trump say about the decision?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News. &quot;I happen to agree with it 100 percent,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The narration picks back up: &quot;Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Trump an eminent domain supporter, and does he agree with the <em>Kelo vs. New London, Conn.</em> decision that many conservatives deride?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club for Growth described it as &quot;eminent domain abuse&quot; -- but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump and <em>Kelo</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2005 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/29/the-story-behind-the-kelo-case-how-an-obscure-takings-case-came-to-shock-the-conscience-of-the-nation/\"><em>Kelo </em>case concerned</a> the government of New London, Conn., which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city. Several residents who didn&rsquo;t want to lose their homes, including a nurse named Susette Kelo, sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the government&rsquo;s eminent domain powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a liberal majority 5-4 <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/04-108\">decision</a>, the Supreme Court found in New London&rsquo;s favor. While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public -- as in government-run -- work, this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Trump said he agreed with the decision, even though it was controversial. We found the July 19, 2005, transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growth&rsquo;s ad. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Fox&rsquo;s Neil Cavuto:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Cavuto:</strong> &quot;What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Trump:</strong> &quot;Well, it&#39;s sort of not a good one for me to say, because I noticed every article written about it said, &lsquo;Will Donald Trump take over your home?&rsquo; sort of using me as the example, Neil. And it&#39;s sort of -- it&#39;s an interesting situation to be in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;But I happen to agree with it 100 percent, not that I would want to use it. But the fact is, if you have a person living in an area that&#39;s not even necessarily a good area, and government, whether it&#39;s local or whatever, government wants to build a tremendous economic development, where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area that&#39;s not good into a good area, and move the person that&#39;s living there into a better place -- now, I know it might not be their choice -- but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things, I think it happens to be good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Trump acknowledges, he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high-profile case involving his property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1990s, Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., but several pieces of private property were in the way -- including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking. When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump, New Jersey&rsquo;s casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government. Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the <em>Kelo </em>case a few years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid&nbsp;2000s, but what does he think of it now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>His current views</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then. On Oct. 6, 2015, Fox&rsquo;s Bret Baier asked Trump, &quot;What do you think of eminent domain?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think eminent domain is wonderful,&quot; Trump responded, adding that as a builder, he knows &quot;better than anybody&quot; how frustrating it can be when you&rsquo;re building a project, and one property holds out and refuses to sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And you need a house in a certain location because you&#39;re going to build this massive development that&#39;s going to employ thousands of people. Or you&#39;re going to build a factory that without this little house, you can&#39;t build the factory,&quot; he said. &quot;I think eminent domain is fine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the <em>Kelo </em>decision. Trump did not respond directly to that question, though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it&#39;s a great subject -- it&#39;s a very interesting subject,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I fully understand the conservative approach, but I don&#39;t think it was explained to most conservatives.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club for Growth said &quot;Trump supports eminent domain&quot; and the Supreme Court&rsquo;s <em>Kelo </em>decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As recently as this week Trump has expressed support for eminent domain, and he has in the past said he agrees with the <em>Kelo </em>decision, which expanded the power, &quot;100 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Club for Growth&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-07T17:09:40.708530", "ruling_date": "2015-10-07T17:40:15", "ruling_headline": "Trump supports eminent domain 'abuse,' says conservative Club for Growth", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-supports-eminent-domain-abuse-says-conservat", "ruling_link_text": "He's proud of it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Club for Growth, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZeKdfxI_RA\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>One Hundred Percent,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nexis, news transcript archive searches, conducted Oct. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/nyregion/residents-of-new-london-go-to-court-saying-project-puts-profit-before-homes.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Residents of New London Go to Court, Saying Project Puts Profit Before Homes,</u></a>&quot; Dec. 21, 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;For Homeowners, Frustration and Anger at Court Ruling,&quot; June 24, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/09/24/443131389/get-off-my-lawn-conservatives-critique-trump-on-eminent-domain\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Get Off My Lawn: Conservatives Critique Trump On Eminent Domain,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/22/club-for-growth-trumps-economic-policies-put-him-in-liberal-mainstream/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Club for Growth: Trump&rsquo;s economic policies put him in liberal mainstream</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/29/the-story-behind-the-kelo-case-how-an-obscure-takings-case-came-to-shock-the-conscience-of-the-nation/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The story behind Kelo v.
