There&rsquo;s no warrant out for Obama&rsquo;s arrest, and he&rsquo;s definitely not getting arrested by the FBI. We&rsquo;ve also found no evidence to support Trump&rsquo;s claim that the wiretapping <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/05/sarah-huckabee-sanders/why-white-houses-defense-trump-accusing-obama-wire/\">even</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/mar/06/did-donald-trump-invent-claim-barack-obama-tapped-/\">took</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/28/blog-posting/trump-did-not-give-every-working-american-612-thro/\">place</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the stories are all essentially identical, saying that Obama will be &quot;picked up by&quot; the FBI sometime today or be charged with unlawful use of authority for ordering an illegal wiretap on the phones in Trump Tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stories also quote a &quot;spokesman&quot; for the FBI, Todd McMartin, who supposedly told Fox News: &quot;The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can&rsquo;t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that quote is made up, though.
