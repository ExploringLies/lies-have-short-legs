It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton Foundation, founded by former President Bill Clinton, also refuted the post&rsquo;s claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This story is totally fabricated. We have encouraged people to donate to relief efforts on the ground. Nothing in this story is true,&quot; said Brian Cookstra, Clinton Foundation spokesman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an Aug. 28 Medium <a href=\"https://medium.com/clintonfoundation/the-response-to-hurricane-harvey-by-members-of-the-clinton-foundation-community-ways-to-support-d93449f31d61\">post</a>, the Clinton Foundation published a list of members of the foundation&#39;s community who are providing relief to survivors of Hurricane Harvey. Those organizations include the American Red Cross, Houston Food Bank and Americares, which the foundation said has responded to requests for water and medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton Foundation is an international humanitarian charity that came under scrutiny by Hillary Clinton opponents during the 2016 presidential campaign. (PolitiFact fact-checked <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/01/fact-checking-clinton-foundation-controversy/\">several claims</a> related to the foundation and how it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/23/politifact-sheet-comparing-clinton-and-trump-found/\">compares to the Trump Foundation</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Clinton has supported national relief efforts in the past, but that was done through separate partnerships. For instance, he worked with former President George H.W. Bush to create a charity, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/us/13brfs-brief-004.html?scp=379&amp;sq=miss+bush&amp;st=nyt\">Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund</a>, to help survivors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A claim from OurLandofTheFree.com that the Clinton Foundation is charging $7 per bottle of water sent to Houston after Hurricane Harvey is made up.
