White House press secretary Sean Spicer on June 19 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/19/press-gaggle-press-secretary-sean-spicer-6192017\">said</a> DACA is under review but did not provide a timeline for a final determination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Close to 800,000 immigrants have been approved for DACA, according to USCIS <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_performancedata_fy2017_qtr2.pdf\">data</a> released June 8.

USCIS told us DACA applications are not accepted online, only by mail, and that the lockbox where requests are sent typically accepts mail from Monday through Friday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did our own calculation using Pfeiffer&rsquo;s parameters and also got about 98,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked USCIS for a month-by-month breakdown of approved applications, but did not receive the information by deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coulter did not respond to our inquiries sent via social media or her booking company.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">DACA recipients granted amnesty?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether DACA beneficiaries are getting amnesty is a not a settled matter among experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/17/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-immigration-bill-not-amnesty/\">noted before</a> that a legal definition of <a href=\"http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=2401\">amnesty</a> is &quot;a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out &hellip; Amnesty is not a pardon as some believe, since a pardon implies forgiveness, and amnesty indicates a reason to overlook or forget the offenses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The common reference for amnesty in modern American politics is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law paved the way for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become lawful permanent residents if they met certain requirements, including being in the country by Jan. 1, 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals granted DACA are protected from deportation for two years and are eligible for work permits. Recipients can apply to renew their DACA protection, but are not granted a lawful status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DACA is a temporary and limited kind of relief that can be revoked by the president, said Kevin R. Johnson, an immigration law expert and dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;DACA does not create a lasting &lsquo;amnesty&rsquo; and lawful permanent residence&quot; as did the 1986 law, Johnson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others see it differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the benefits it offers, DACA is amnesty, said Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would define an amnesty as such whenever the law is set aside and the normal penalty is waived as a matter of policy,&quot; Camarota said. &quot;The normal penalty for being in the U.S. illegally is removal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In a tweet, Coulter said the Trump administration granted amnesty to &quot;Nearly 100,000 &#39;Dreamers.&#39; &quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump assumed office Jan.&nbsp;20. Data from USCIS shows more than 124,000 people have been approved for DACA from January to March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calculations of the total applications approved January through March that only include days Trump has been in&nbsp;office show that, at least, about 98,000 were approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether the program is amnesty is subject to interpretation.
