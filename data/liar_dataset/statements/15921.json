Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad, released in early August, charged that &quot;West Virginia Joe&quot; had transformed himself into &quot;Washington Joe.&quot; And a key exhibit for this argument was a pricey boat he owned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin owns a &quot;$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht,&quot; the ad said, illustrating the claim with a photograph showing a docked vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this accurate? We took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Does Manchin own a boat?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin&rsquo;s campaign does not dispute that he owns a boat, &quot;Almost Heaven,&quot; saying it is where Manchin has typically lived when in Washington and not back home in West Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the boat is hardly a secret. It has been written about periodically before; articles often mention sessions he&rsquo;s held on the boat with other lawmakers to negotiate legislation and strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/joe-manchin-the-outlier-time-magazine\">Time magazine</a> wrote that both &quot;Almost Heaven&quot; and Manchin&rsquo;s previous vessel, the &quot;Black Tie,&quot; serve as &quot;a kind of floating incubator of that tenderest of Washington flowers in the first decades of the 21st century: bipartisanship.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Is the vessel worth $700,000?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To back up its assertion, the NRSC provided PolitiFact with a document labeled &quot;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4946154-Coast-Guard.html\">general index or abstract of title continuation sheet No. 1</a>,&quot; the cost of the vessel was listed $700,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin&rsquo;s campaign instead offered a different document with a lower dollar figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That document, a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4946155-House-Boat-4.html\">memorandum of sale</a> from 2014, said the purchase price for the vessel was $220,000. The document says that Manchin purchased the boat from M&amp;T Bank, with National Liquidators as the broker of the sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Independent experts we contacted were unable to explain the difference in the two dollar figures, beyond speculating that the vessel was purchased from a seller eager to get rid of it and later insured at the boat&rsquo;s market value.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Is it a &quot;luxury yacht&quot;?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.boats.com/on-the-water/when-is-a-boat-also-a-yacht\">Boats.com</a>, any vessel &quot;over 40 feet long almost always qualifies&quot; as a yacht. By the length standard alone, that would qualify &quot;Almost Heaven&quot; as a yacht: The vessel, built in 2001, is 65 feet long, according to <a href=\"https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/pls/webpls/cgv_pkg.vessel_id_list?vessel_id_in=1114579\">Coast Guard documents</a> provided to PolitiFact by the NRSC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a &quot;luxury&quot; vessel, however, is in the eye of the beholder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.westlawn.edu/student_center/definitions.asp\">Westlawn Institute of Marine Technology</a>, the word &quot;yacht ... connotes elegance and expense.&quot; Boats.com adds, &quot;Just as a cocky walk would never be mistaken for a limping shuffle, yacht attitude is the net result of a combination of factors that are easy to spot as a group but hard to quantify individually.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vessel is listed as &quot;recreational&quot; on documents. However, a less confrontational -- but similarly accurate -- description could be &quot;houseboat,&quot; since it is Manchin&rsquo;s residence in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRSC said that Manchin has a &quot;$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no dispute that Manchin has a boat docked in Washington, D.C. Its 40-foot length would generally qualify it as a yacht, but since Manchin lives there when he is in town, it could be just as easily described as a houseboat. The vessel was purchased for much less, but it appears to be insured for $700,000. Whether it qualifies as a &quot;luxury&quot; vessel is a matter of opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information we&rsquo;ve found backs up elements of both the NRSC&rsquo;s original assertion and Manchin&rsquo;s counterargument, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-27T08:59:23.205290", "ruling_date": "2018-09-28T09:39:01", "ruling_headline": "Does Joe Manchin have a $700,000 luxury yacht?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-joe-manchin-have-700000-luxury-yacht", "ruling_link_text": "Price documentation varies", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>National Republican Senatorial Committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRSC/status/1026830107229544448/video/1\">tweet</a>, Aug. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boats.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.boats.com/on-the-water/when-is-a-boat-also-a-yacht\">When is a Boat Also a Yacht?</a>&quot; Aug. 22, 2018 &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Westlawn Institute of Marine Technology, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.westlawn.edu/student_center/definitions.asp\">Definitions of: Boat, Yacht, Small Craft, and Related Terms</a>,&quot; Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time magazine, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/joe-manchin-the-outlier-time-magazine\">Joe Manchin: The Outlier</a>,&quot; Aug. 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Virginia Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://apps.sos.wv.gov/business/corporations/organization.aspx?org=328581\">website</a>, accessed Aug. 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Bob Salera, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Aug. 29, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jonathan Kott, spokesman for Joe Manchin, Aug. 29, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 143, "last_name": "National Republican Senatorial Committee", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "national-republican-senatorial-committee", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Logo_NRC_Elephant_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/143/", "total_count": 35, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Sen.
