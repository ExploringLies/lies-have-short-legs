Nathan Deal has spent much of his first term promoting Georgia as the premier state to start a business or to expand.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his speech, the governor claimed his efforts are working.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Since I stood before you last year at this address, we have announced more than 10,000 jobs, and many of these are on the high end of the employment scale,&quot; Deal said. &quot;More and more businesses are deciding to make Georgia their home.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Deal spokesman did not respond to a request for specifics to back up this claim. We began our research by reading each news release on Deal&rsquo;s website since his 2012 State of the State address. More than two dozen of the releases include announcements of new jobs that would be created in Georgia. By our count, the total was slightly more than 9,000. The releases do not say whether all the positions are full-time jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe interpreted Deal&rsquo;s comments that many of the jobs were &quot;on the high end of the employment scale&quot; to mean that they will command high salaries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is some support for the governor&rsquo;s claim on that point:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">\r\n\t\tGeneral Motors announced earlier this month that it was going to employ about 1,000 Georgians at an information technology plant in Roswell.
