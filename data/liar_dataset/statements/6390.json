(In September 2011, we rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/09/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-democratic-rep-tamm/\">Mostly </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/09/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-democratic-rep-tamm/\">True</a> a claim that she is the most liberal.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith a July 26, 2012 <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=275643\">news release</a>, GOP candidate Jeff Fitzgerald took a different tack on Baldwin&#39;s record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Without her extreme liberal voting record, you wouldn&rsquo;t even know she has been in Washington for the last 14 years,&quot; the Wisconsin Assembly speaker said, adding:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In her nearly decade and (a) half in Congress, Tammy Baldwin has sponsored 105 bills. Only three have been enacted into law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe implication: Baldwin is ineffective.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fitzgerald&#39;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin, who is unchallenged in the Democratic primary, entered Congress in January 1999. She is serving her seventh two-year term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFitzgerald&rsquo;s news release provided a term-by-term count of the 105 bills he said Baldwin sponsored, plus a summary of the three it said became law. (Baldwin&rsquo;s campaign agrees with the numbers.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr1760\">House Resolution 1760</a>, introduced in 2005, named a Madison post office for Robert LaFollette Sr., who served in the U.S. House and Senate, and as Wisconsin&rsquo;s governor, in the late 1800s and early 1900s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr1132\">House Resolution 1132</a>, introduced in 2007, provided waivers relating to grants to expand screenings and follow-up services for breast and cervical cancer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd her <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr797\">House Resolution 797</a>, also introduced in 2007, modified standards to allow more veterans to qualify for disability compensation for vision impairment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the three did become law, none was a major piece of legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Baldwin response</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked to respond, Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said most of her bills had Republican co-sponsors. And he argued that legislation she currently backs is being &quot;obstructed by the GOP.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeither point refutes Fitzgerald&rsquo;s claim on the number of Baldwin-sponsored bills that have become law. But Kraus also made a third point that goes to Fitzgerald&rsquo;s suggestion that Baldwin has been unproductive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKraus noted U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/\">Paul Ryan</a>, R-Wis., who also the entered House in 1999, has sponsored 75 bills, with two becoming law. (<a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr4241\">One</a> named a post office and <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/hr5394\">one</a> modified excise taxes on arrows.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeither of those measures qualifies as major legislation, either -- even though Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, is prominent enough to be mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe implication: Looking strictly at bills passed doesn&rsquo;t say much about the overall performance of a lawmaker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The number of bills introduced that are enacted into law is a blunt and often misleading measure of legislative effectiveness,&quot; congressional scholar <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/experts/mannt\">Thomas Mann</a>, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., told us. &quot;Many of the most effective legislators seldom introduce bills themselves but work instead in committee and on the floor to influence the shape of legislation. Paul Ryan is a good case in point.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe would add that many factors -- such as which party controls Congress and the White House -- affect whether a bill becomes law. And sponsoring legislation is only one of the myriad tasks a House member performs. On her House website, for example, Baldwin <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/about/major-accomplishments.shtml\">claims</a> credit for bringing more than $100 million in federal money to her district.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuggesting that Baldwin has been nearly invisible in Congress, Fitzgerald claimed: &quot;In her nearly decade and (a) half in Congress, Tammy Baldwin has sponsored 105 bills. Only three have been enacted into law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis statement is accurate, but it needs clarification. The number of Baldwin bills that became law is only one measure of her overall record -- and one that can be misleading when viewed in isolation. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-03T14:33:15.520391", "ruling_date": "2012-08-06T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "In Wisconsin Senate race, Republican Jeff Fitzgerald say Dem U.S. Rep.
