(<a href=\"http://nbcnews.to/20mJEj8\">Watch the clip</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Trump really say that? He definitely tweeted that view once in 2012, though he has since distanced himself a bit from that theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clearest example comes from a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">tweet</a> sent by Trump on Nov. 6, 2012. &quot;The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/m9ng9J5x7cPt5hCdU0jra747rUW4ThWLwBSttX2FVahJqg2qs_8glOrWcQGxgq8wje5bOwtLvIHBDRYargjChY7bQuaxD9T-eNiOAVfxlFJWQnvFXR9whCXUl6cAnW_0Q8qgHoi9\" style=\"border:none; height:321px; width:617px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Sanders certainly has evidence to support his claim. But Trump has somewhat backed off after Sanders&#39; comments, calling the Chinese link a &quot;joke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump&rsquo;s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>, &quot;Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I&#39;d be &mdash; received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn&#39;t care less. They have very &mdash; you know, their standards are nothing. But they &mdash; in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it&#39;s very hard on our business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump has said his 2012 tweet was a joke. However, he has used the word &quot;hoax&quot; repeatedly in describing climate change, although he doesn&rsquo;t always fault China. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a &quot;hoax&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/01/lenar-whitney/republican-congressional-hopeful-says-global-warmi/\">Pants on Fire</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, on Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., &quot;Obama&#39;s talking about all of this with the global warming and &hellip; a lot of it&#39;s a hoax. It&#39;s a hoax. I mean, it&#39;s a money-making industry, OK? It&#39;s a hoax, a lot of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s three times using &quot;hoax&quot; in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since that 2012 tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">tweeted</a>, &quot;NBC News just called it the great freeze &mdash; coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YuCytf1V9yOGf4JUQETTD5ORywavl62EobUF6J_MStnba_Ia-BpEr8BA0EBiUvI7F18NT8dyyVuyyhkvg6JvUm4QrTZ12fAcgqFXoKWbxSU9T12493g8i4m4tXnxuE_KxBdnwhcF\" style=\"border:none; height:351px; width:592px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428414113463955457\">tweeted</a>: &quot;Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond.

Whether Trump still feels that way is less clear.&nbsp;Asked about it recently, the real estate developer called it a joke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a &quot;hoax&quot; in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn&rsquo;t necessarily repeated the charge that China &quot;invented&quot; climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate&nbsp;change &quot;is done for the benefit of China.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-24T11:28:55.281578", "ruling_date": "2016-01-24T14:25:13", "ruling_headline": "What Donald Trump said about the Chinese inventing the 'hoax' of climate change", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h", "ruling_link_text": "Trump frequently called climate change a hoax", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bernie Sanders, comments on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em>, Jan. 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">tweet</a>, Nov. 6, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">tweet</a>, Jan. 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428414113463955457\">tweet</a>, Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428418323660165120\">tweet</a>, Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, comments on <em>Fox &amp;
