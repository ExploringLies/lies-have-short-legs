Backers are relying on money from tolling to help pay for a new bridge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was the concern that Sen. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Portland, was channeling during a floor speech in opposition to House Bill 2800, which authorized the state to sell $450 million worth of bonds for the project, known as the Columbia River Crossing. The controversial bill has cleared both chambers and Gov. John Kitzhaber&rsquo;s signature is expected Tuesday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn her speech, Dingfelder said she worried that toll-wary travelers would seek out refuge on Interstate 205, using the Glenn Jackson Bridge to cross the Columbia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I-205, six miles of which runs through my district, already carries more traffic than I-5,&quot; Dingfelder said, so piling on more will hurt her neighborhood.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe snapped to attention at her assertion that I-205 carries more traffic. Has I-205, completed in 1983 as a bypass corridor for I-5 traffic, surpassed its older sibling with regards to traffic over the bridges?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe went to the Oregon Department of Transportation for the answer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe agency tracks how many vehicles pass at certain points along all of its freeways. Those records show that in 2011, 123,900 &quot;average daily trips&quot; were recorded on I-5 at the Interstate Bridge. On I-205, 138,700 trips were recorded at the Glenn Jackson Bridge. The trips include both northbound and southbound.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo I-205 has 11 percent more traffic at the bridge. And we suppose that makes sense, since the Glenn Jackson Bridge is nearly twice as wide as the Interstate Bridge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRuling:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t know how many motorists would head over to I-205 to avoid a toll, but we do know that Dingfelder&rsquo;s right. More cars already travel across the I-205 bridge than the I-5 bridge. We rate this statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-11T19:26:40.527393", "ruling_date": "2013-03-12T03:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Does Interstate 205 carry more traffic than Interstate 5?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-interstate-205-carry-more-traffic-interstate-", "ruling_link_text": "11 percent more traffic", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterviews with Don Hamilton, Oregon Department of Transportation, March 4, March 5, 2013<br />\r\n\t2011 Traffic Volumes on State Highways report<br />\r\n\tThe Oregonian, &quot;Final 6.6 miles of I-205 opened; traffic builds fast,&quot; March 9, 1983<br />\r\n\tSen.
