Wilson said. &quot;However, I believe that every vote cast or decision made reflects priorities and values.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We scoured state budget documents and were able to confirm that Wilson is technically right. Morgan, a member of the Georgia House since 2003, voted in favor of an amended 2010 state budget that included cuts to the program for disabled preschoolers, as well to a program giving scholarships to special needs students who want to attend private schools. (The amended budget -- House Bill 947 -- passed in 2010, with 122 yes votes, including Morgan&rsquo;s, and 44 no votes, so an argument could be made that the budget would have passed without Morgan&rsquo;s vote.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s more to the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, these cuts were made when Georgia and the nation were in the aftermath of what&rsquo;s come to be known as the Great Recession. In January 2010, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue was asking lawmakers -- Morgan included -- &nbsp;to cut $1.2 billion out of a budget that had already been in place for six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revenue was bleak -- down $136 million, or 8.7 percent, just for that month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program to help disabled 3- and 4-year-olds be better prepared for school didn&rsquo;t escape the cutting. Neither did the special needs scholarship program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $29 million budget for the preschool disabled program was cut about $2 million. About $1 million of that came from furloughing employees and cuts to employer insurance premiums &nbsp;--- something that was done across all of state government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan&rsquo;s campaign points out that the preschool budget was cut by a smaller percentage, nearly 6.9 percent, than most departments. Records show state spending to pre-school was cut less than many departments, such as Agriculture, Economic Development, Natural Resources and the Regents System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funding for the private school scholarships was cut $4 million, and officials in the House Budget Office say that was based strictly on the state&rsquo;s education funding formula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that the state budget can, in theory, be amended when it hits the floor of either the House or Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rule 108.3 spells out the protocol in the House. &quot;No amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order if the amendment has the effect of both reducing one appropriation and either increasing another appropriation or adding a new appropriation. No amendment to any appropriations bill increasing any appropriation or adding a new appropriation shall be in order unless there has previously been adopted an amendment reducing some other appropriation so as to make funds available for such new or increased appropriation; and no amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order which would cause the bill to violate the balanced budget requirements of the Constitution.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Longtime observers say floor amendments to the budget have been tried a few times, but rarely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Brewer, Morgan&rsquo;s deputy campaign manager, said the claims in Wilson&rsquo;s flier are &quot;intellectually disingenuous, at best.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They overlook the tough economic times and the state&rsquo;s obligation to balance its budget and pay its bills, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tough choices were made to tighten the state&rsquo;s belt, so to speak, without raising taxes on Georgia families during the difficult economic recession,&quot; Brewer said. &quot;Cuts were made across the board to every state agency and department, and legislators did everything they could to reduce and stymie those cuts to education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2014 state budget approved by lawmakers last year, funding for the preschool disabled program was back to $29 million, the amount it was before the 2010 midyear cuts, he pointed out. Morgan also voted in favor of that budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, Wilson is correct that Morgan voted for an amended state budget for 2010 that included cuts to the preschool disabled program and a scholarship program for special needs students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a lot of context is needed to understand the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state was in economic hard times in 2010, and cuts were being ordered across all state agencies, with sign-off from a majority of the General Assembly, not just Morgan. These programs represent a small fraction of the state&rsquo;s multibillion-dollar annual budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has encountered many cases where candidates accuse elected officials of supporting cuts without noting that these votes were parts of larger budget decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilson&rsquo;s attack against Morgan omits key context. It is accurate but misleading. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement as Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-23T18:20:39.494797", "ruling_date": "2014-05-27T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Georgia superintendent candidate criticizes opponent for past votes", "ruling_headline_slug": "georgia-superintendent-candidate-criticizes-oppone", "ruling_link_text": "Complaint doesn't completely add up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Valerie Wilson <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1165214-valarie-wilson-pamphlet.html\">flier</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Michael Brewer, deputy campaign manager for Alisha Thomas Morgan, May 23, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conference Committee Substitute <a href=\"http://www.house.ga.gov/budget/Documents/2010_FiscalYear/AFY_2010_Bill_Final_Conf_Cmte_.pdf\">breakdown</a> of&nbsp;HB 947.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Nick Gill, Gragert Research, Chicago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone calls and emails with Stephanie Libby, Springboard Consulting, working for Wilson campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiscal 2010 amended <a href=\"http://www.house.ga.gov/budget/Documents/2010_FiscalYear/AFY_2010_Bill_Final_Conf_Cmte_.pdf\">budget</a>, House Bill 947, budget cuts to special needs scholarships (155.4 line), Page 98; preschool handicapped program (157.1), Pages 98 and 99.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://sonnyperdue.georgia.gov/00/press/detail/0%2c2668%2c78006749_154885747_156523971%2c00.html\">Governor Announces January Revenue Figures</a>,&quot; press release, Georgia governor&rsquo;s office, Feb. 9, 2010, </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://sonnyperdue.georgia.gov/00/press/detail/0%2c2668%2c78006749_154885747_155569893%2c00.html\">Governor Delivers Functionally Balanced Budgets That Invest in Georgia&rsquo;s Future</a>,&quot; press release, Georgia governor&rsquo;s office, Jan. 15, 2010.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Executive Director of the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership, Inc.", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Valarie", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2810, "last_name": "Wilson", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "valarie-wilson", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Valarie_Wilson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2810/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://valforeducation.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says&nbsp;Democratic candidate for state school superintendent Alisha Thomas Morgan voted to slash funding for the preschool programs for disabled and special needs students.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a pamphlet", "statement_date": "2014-05-14", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Alisha", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2707, "last_name": "Thomas Morgan", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "alisha-thomas-morgan", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Alisha_Thomas_Morgan.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2707/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.alishamorgan.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
