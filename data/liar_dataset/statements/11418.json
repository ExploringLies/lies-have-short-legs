Bernie Sanders turned to some statistics he&rsquo;s used before on the stump, decrying high rates of joblessness among young African-Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent,&quot; Sanders said at the Oct. 13, 2015, debate in Las Vegas. &quot;Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s similar -- but not identical -- to a claim we checked in July. Back then, he said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, &quot;the real unemployment rate &hellip; is 51 percent.&quot; We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/13/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-real-unemployment-rate-african/\">Mostly True</a>. However, since the claim was phrased somewhat differently, we&rsquo;ll take a fresh look at it here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the debate, Sanders didn&rsquo;t define the age range in question, but the most readily available &quot;youth&quot; data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers ages 16 to 19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For individuals age 16 to 19 in September 2015, the official unemployment rate for whites was 13.9 percent, for Hispanics it was 18.6 percent, and for African-Americans it was 31.5 percent. For individuals in that age range of all races and ethnicities, the unemployment rate was 16.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the rates for both minority groups are lower than the rate for whites, they are still well below the figures Sanders offered at the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s going on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked this claim in July, we noted that Sanders, by using the term &quot;the real unemployment rate,&quot; had telegraphed that he was not using the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, when we asked Sanders&rsquo; camp for supporting evidence, they pointed us to<a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/young-black-high-school-grads-face-astonishing-underemployment/\"> research</a> by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data was different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, the institute didn&rsquo;t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were &quot;marginally attached to the labor force.&quot; The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren&rsquo;t entirely out of the market, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of &quot;labor underutilization&quot; rather than &quot;unemployment.&quot; EPI itself used the term &quot;underemployment&quot; in its research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a real statistic, but in July Sanders didn&rsquo;t really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term &quot;unemployment rate&quot; and once used the variation &quot;real unemployment rate,&quot; a vague term that doesn&rsquo;t have any official definition at BLS and wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His phrasing during the debate was even more problematic. He simply said, &quot;unemployment rate,&quot; without indicating that he was using a non-standard measurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the EPI data only went through March 2015. But since March, the overall unemployment rate for all African-Americans has fallen by almost 1 percentage point, though the rate for the subset of 16-to-19-year-olds has zigzagged since then. (This youth subset is based on a small sample and has a higher margin of error.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this said, Sanders does have a point that young African-Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of unemployment than young whites do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s odd about Sanders&#39; choice is that he could have used the official unemployment statistics and still made his point that African American and Hispanic youth have higher rates of unemployment than other groups,&quot; said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the debate, Sanders said that &quot;African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has a point that African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But his numbers are too far off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the standard method for determining the jobless rate, the figure for African-American youths is 31.5 percent and for Hispanic youths it&rsquo;s 18.6 percent. While those rates are still disproportionately high, they are not nearly as high as Sanders said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-13T22:25:46.761777", "ruling_date": "2015-10-13T22:23:47", "ruling_headline": "In debate, Bernie Sanders says African-American youth unemployment is 51%, and 36% for Hispanics", "ruling_headline_slug": "debate-bernie-sanders-says-african-american-youth-", "ruling_link_text": "Not by the official statistics", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bernie Sanders, comments in the CNN Democratic debate, Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ln\">Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey</a>&quot; (main index page), accessed Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic Policy Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/young-black-high-school-grads-face-astonishing-underemployment/\">Young Black High School Grads Face Astonishing Underemployment</a>,&quot; June 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/13/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-real-unemployment-rate-african/\">Bernie Sanders says &#39;real unemployment&#39; rate for African American youth is 51 percent</a>,&quot; June 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed, Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Bernie", "half_true_count": 28, "home_state": "Vermont", "id": 218, "last_name": "Sanders", "mostly_true_count": 46, "name_slug": "bernie-sanders", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "edition": "Vermont", "edition_slug": "vermont", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 65, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "Vermont Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/65/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/218/", "total_count": 129, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://sanders.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent.
