Roys, a former state Assembly member from Madison, accused Walker of putting prisons ahead of the University of Wisconsin System, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I think in 2011, it was Walker&rsquo;s first budget, and we had the dubious distinction of spending -- for the first time in our state&rsquo;s history -- more on our prison system that we did on the entire UW System.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a claim likely to be repeated during the campaign, so let&rsquo;s check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Journal Sentinel report</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker was elected in 2010; his first state budget was for 2011-&rsquo;13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-corrections-spending-passes-that-of-uw-system-ua62t4k-166039926.html/\">reported in 2012</a>, that two-year budget allotted, for the first time, more money for prisons and correctional facilities -- that is, for the Department of Corrections -- than for the UW System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tallies, after a <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wis-gov-signs-budget-cutting-education-185b/\">$250 million cut</a> to the UW System:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$2.25 billion: Corrections</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$2.1 billion: UW System</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The operations of the <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2017/0054_adult_corrections_program_informational_paper_54.pdf\">Department of Corrections</a> include&nbsp;running 36 adult prisons and correctional facilities, supervising adult offenders who are probation or parole, and managing the state&rsquo;s two juvenile correctional facilities and community services for juvenile offenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2017/0032_university_of_wisconsin_system_overview_informational_paper_32.pdf\">UW System</a> has 13 four-year campuses, including the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison, 13 two-year campuses (known as the UW Colleges) and a statewide extension with offices in each county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s report, which reviewed more than 20 years of Wisconsin state budgets, pointed out that the eclipse in funding between the two agencies was the culmination of years of policy changes made under both Republican and Democratic governors prior to Walker. Also, nationwide, public universities were seeing cuts while prison spending, sparked by sentencing changes put in motion in the 1980s, was going up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the change did occur on Walker&rsquo;s watch, though it was the culmination of a shift over a period of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a little more context, we reviewed all four of the state budgets that have been adopted under Walker and the four adopted previously, all of which were under Gov. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/jim-doyle/\">Jim Doyle</a>, a Democrat.
