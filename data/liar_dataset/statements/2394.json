Roy Barnes, who is running to reclaim his old seat, is like Obama because he&#39;s apologizing, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican Governors Association makes the accusation in a recent TV commercial.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our president has traveled the globe apologizing for America,&quot; the announcer says. &quot;Our former governor Roy Barnes is traveling the state apologizing for his first term in office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad concludes: &quot;Roy Barnes and Barack Obama need to know: Georgians don&rsquo;t want apologies. They want results.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs Barnes an apologist like our president?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans have been playing Six Degrees of Obama with Democrats for much of this midterm election season. They&#39;re betting that the closer they link their opposition to the unpopular president the better.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarnes has tried to outmaneuver their attempts for months. In August, he ducked a fundraiser Obama held in Atlanta. Barnes&#39; campaign manager said the former governor wasn&#39;t invited, a claim AJC PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants On Fire.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs proof of the RGA&#39;s accusations, its spokesman Mike Schrimpf pointed us to the group&#39;s anti-Barnes website, http://roybama.com. It lists what the RGA considers to be apologies by Obama and Barnes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a bit about Obama and apologies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National published an item on similar accusations against the president in a book by former Massachusetts governor and 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney said Obama &quot;has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National reviewed seven Obama speeches cited by Romney and ran them by several experts with different points of view. They also looked at previous presidential apologies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey found Romney&#39;s statement False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the experts PolitiFact National consulted was Nile Gardiner, who co-wrote the list of Obama apologies cited by the http://roybama.com website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet PolitiFact National found Romney&#39;s notion of what counts as an Obama apology, which aligns with Gardiner&#39;s viewpoint, to be invalid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney&#39;s criticisms. ... But in our review of his words, we came up short,&quot; the item concluded. &quot;Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it&#39;s typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well. There&#39;s not a full-throated, sincere apology in the bunch.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Obama is not apologizing for America.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what about Barnes? Is he apologizing for his first term in office?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe RGA cites three examples, all from videos Barnes&#39; campaign posted on its YouTube page. We&#39;ll take them one at a time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Roy Apologizes&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis campaign video, targeted at teachers, is titled &quot;Roy Apologizes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I apologize. But it was never my intent, and it is not my intent now, not to treasure teachers and learning,&quot; he says in the video. He adds that he didn&#39;t listen enough to teachers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s an apology.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Providence&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this TV commercial, which ran during the primaries, Barnes says that &quot;as governor, my heart was in the right place, but I didn&rsquo;t listen or slow down to explain why I had to make some difficult decisions. For that, I apologize.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tApology? Yes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Listening&quot; </strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this video released more than a year ago, Barnes says he has been driving across the state listening to Georgians.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe doesn&#39;t utter the word &quot;apology.&quot; He doesn&#39;t say he&#39;s sorry, either. Instead, Barnes says he &quot;learned some lessons&quot; since he lost the 2002 gubernatorial election to Sonny Perdue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarnes says he needs to listen. &quot;Listening is not something I did too much of when I was a governor before. I tried to do too much, too fast. I&rsquo;ve learned some lessons. I learned I should explain myself more,&quot; he says.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tApology? This is a tougher call. Barnes acknowledges mistakes and says he is changing his ways. But he never outright says he is apologizing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, though, there&#39;s no doubt Barnes is giving a mea culpa. The Barnes campaign said that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing, and politicians need to look back and assess their actions more often.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Growing up in Sunday school, Roy learned that if you feel you should apologize, you should,&quot; spokesman Emil Runge said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that can be a smart strategy, University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFormer President Bill Clinton used that approach when he lost his bid for re-election after his first term as governor of Arkansas. He spent much of his next campaign apologizing and reclaimed his seat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the RGA&#39;s analogy has some truth to it. Barnes is apologizing for his first term, and he&#39;s proud of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that doesn&#39;t make him like Obama, since the president has not apologized for America&#39;s actions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe give the RGA&#39;s statement a Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-15T09:31:21.047582", "ruling_date": "2010-09-15T09:24:01", "ruling_headline": "Barnes and Obama \"sorry\", GOP says", "ruling_headline_slug": "barnes-and-obama-sorry-gop-says", "ruling_link_text": "Barnes \"sorry\" like Obama", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/15/mitt-romney/obama-remarks-never-true-apology/\">Obama&#39;s remarks never a true &#39;apology</a>,&#39; &quot; March 15, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican Governors Association <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/RepGovs#p/u/2/CqEikjKfDfM\">commercial</a>, &quot;Georgia Apologize,&quot; posted Aug. 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Heritage Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2009/06/Barack-Obamas-Top-10-Apologies-How-the-President-Has-Humiliated-a-Superpower\">Barack Obama&#39;s Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower</a>,&quot; June 2, 2009,<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoy 2010 campaign <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVlL_ASh0s\">video</a>, &quot;Roy Apologizes,&quot; posted June 8, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoy 2010 campaign <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/2010roybarnes#p/u/26/AURI4I5O7Nk\">video</a>, &quot;Listening,&quot; posted July 20, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAJC PolitiFact Georgia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2010/jul/30/chris-carpenter/barnes-campain-says-former-governor-not-invited-ob/\">Barnes campaign says former Democratic governor not invited to Obama&#39;s Atlanta visit</a>,&quot; July 30, 2010,<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Charles Bullock, political science professor, University of Georgia, Sept. 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview, Mike Schrimpf, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, Sept. 9, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 321, "last_name": "Republican Governors Association", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "republican-governors-association", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GOP_elephant.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/321/", "total_count": 20, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.rga.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tRoy Barnes is like Barack Obama because they&#39;re both doing a lot of apologizing.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV commercial", "statement_date": "2010-08-17", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 321, "last_name": "Republican Governors Association", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "republican-governors-association", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GOP_elephant.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/321/", "total_count": 20, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.rga.org/"}], "twitter_headline": "Barnes \"sorry\" like Obama, GOP says.
