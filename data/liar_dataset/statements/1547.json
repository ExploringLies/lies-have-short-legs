Rick Perry told supporters Tuesday that energized voters are upset at congressional spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a wide-ranging speech, Perry specified two factors, saying: &quot;Washington cannot hide from the fact that Congress hiked the national debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion. They cannot hide from the fact . . . that the budget that they&rsquo;re going forward with has more than $5 trillion in debt in it over the next five years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo those debt numbers hold up?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry&#39;s campaign pointed us to news accounts of the U.S. House and Senate voting in January to raise the federal government&rsquo;s debt limit to $14.3 trillion, a historic high adopted solely with Democratic votes in the Democrat-majority bodies. Proponents noted that the increase was needed to allow the government to continue borrowing and avoid default.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Perry&#39;s reference to the federal debt increasing by $5 trillion over five years, his campaign pointed to a Feb. 1 article on President Barack Obama&#39;s proposed 2011 federal budget. The story says Obama&#39;s proposal would result in deficits of $5.08 trillion over five years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeparately, Obama&#39;s proposed budget shows the nation&#39;s public debt increasing from $7.5 trillion in 2009, reflecting actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Congress that made budget decisions in 2008, to $13.1 trillion in 2014&mdash;potentially increasing $5.6 trillion. The debt increase from 2010 to 2015 is projected at $4.7 trillion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJosh Gordon of The Concord Coalition, which advocates long-term fiscal responsibilty, cautioned that much of the current and immediately expected deficits are due to economic troubles and not White House or congressional actions. Gordon said it&#39;s typical for government to run a deficit during an economic downturn.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the end, Obama&rsquo;s proposed budget won&rsquo;t sail through Congress; presidents (and governors) propose, lawmakers dispose. Still, Obama&#39;s proposal seems a reasonable basis for Perry&rsquo;s debt claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor also is correct on the size of the increased federal debt limit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Perry&#39;s statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-03T18:06:21.851528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-04T06:21:59", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
