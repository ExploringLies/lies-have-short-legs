Jackie Speier, D-Calif., was one of many voices who noticed the administration&rsquo;s hardened view toward WikiLeaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer interviewed Speier, a member of the House intelligence committee, on April 13 about Pompeo&rsquo;s characterization of WikiLeaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much did Trump the candidate love WikiLeaks in the last days of the campaign? She attempted to count the ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you recall during the election cycle, in the last month of the campaign, I believe that President Trump as a candidate hailed WikiLeaks as the new savior, had mentioned it over 160 times in speeches during that period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really, that many times? We decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WikiLeaks released <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html\">tens of thousands</a> of emails from the account of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign chairman John Podesta in October 2016&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/03/world/wikileaks-fast-facts/\">released thousands of emails</a>&nbsp;from Democratic National Committee staffers in July 2016. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speier&rsquo;s office said she was referring to a Jan. 7 article by<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-mentioned-wikileaks-164-times-in-last-month-of-election-now-claims-it-didnt-impact-one-40aa62ea5002\"> left-leaning website ThinkProgress</a> for her statement. Here&rsquo;s how that article began:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President-elect Trump says that information published by WikiLeaks, which the U.S. intelligence community says was hacked by Russia, had &lsquo;absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.&rsquo; This was not the view of candidate Trump, who talked about WikiLeaks and the content of the emails it released at least 164 times in last month of the campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article analyzed Trump&rsquo;s &quot;speeches, media&nbsp;appearances and debates&quot; to get a tally of <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-mentioned-wikileaks-164-times-in-last-month-of-election-now-claims-it-didnt-impact-one-40aa62ea5002\">164 mentions</a> from Oct. 10 to Nov. 8. That number includes 124 times Trump mentioned the group by name, with the rest being mentions of the emails released by WikiLeaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on our own review, looking through transcripts from Congressional Quarterly by searching for the words &quot;WikiLeaks&quot; and &quot;Trump,&quot; and limiting results to the last month of the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found Trump said the word &quot;WikiLeaks&quot; about 137 times in campaign rallies, interviews, speeches, his tweets and other social media presence, and debates. Speier&rsquo;s figure of over 160 seems possible, however, because he often referenced disclosures from WikiLeaks without using the group&rsquo;s name, and it&rsquo;s possible there were interviews or speeches where Trump brought up WikiLeaks that our search didn&rsquo;t return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Wikileaks steadily released a series of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These emails were characterized by Trump and her other critics as showing Clinton held policy positions in private that were different from her public positions, that she&nbsp;received town hall topics in advance, and that they demonstrated negative internal dynamics inside the Clinton campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump repeatedly brought up the emails, encouraged his supporters to see them for themselves, and also described several <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/oct/17/10-misleading-trump-attack-lines-wikileaks-email-d/\">revelations inaccurately. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s replay some of the biggest hits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we have ever seen as a country before,&quot; &nbsp;Trump said at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSc-7dOC_kY\">a rally</a> in Colorado on Oct. 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton, as WikiLeaks proves, is a corrupt globalist,&quot; he said at a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?417256-1/donald-trump-campaigns-johnstown-pennsylvania&amp;start=424\">rally</a> on Oct 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I love WikiLeaks,&quot; he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUtT0b0EnSw\">said</a> on Oct. 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has not said much publicly about WikiLeaks as president. The closest moment came during the transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After receiving an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-russia-hacking-intelligence-briefing-233275\">intelligence briefing</a> on Jan. 6, Trump released a statement that said &quot;while Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also brought up Donna Brazile&rsquo;s passing of town hall topics to a Clinton staffer ahead of a primary debate in <a href=\"http://time.com/4710456/donald-trump-time-interview-truth-falsehood/\">an interview with</a> <em>Time</em> magazine on March 23, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speier said Trump as a candidate mentioned WikiLeaks &quot;over 160 times in speeches&quot; in the last 30 days of the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Official counts may vary, but her larger point is clear: Trump brought up WikiLeaks a lot in the waning days of the campaign. He has stayed largely mum about the group since taking office, even as his CIA director said WikiLeaks acts like a &quot;hostile intelligence service.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/13b3ef93-7755-4388-a286-c0f6e047d2e4&quot;&gt;https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/13b3ef93-7755-4388-a286-c0f6e047d2e4&lt;/a&gt; &nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-21T15:10:08.063314", "ruling_date": "2017-04-21T15:01:43", "ruling_headline": "Did Trump really mention WikiLeaks over 160 times in the last month of the election cycle?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-trump-really-mention-wikileaks-over-160-times-", "ruling_link_text": "He said he loved Wikileaks in Oct. 2016", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trump-mentioned-wikileaks-164-times-in-last-month-of-election-now-claims-it-didnt-impact-one-40aa62ea5002\">ThinkProgress</a>, Trump mentioned Wikileaks 164 times in last month of election, now claims it didn&rsquo;t impact one voter, April 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive\">Trump Twitter Archive</a>, Search criteria &quot;Wikileaks,&quot; accessed April 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Quarterly, Transcript Search Keywords &quot;Wikileaks and Trump,&quot; April 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-emails.html\">Donald Trump Finds Improbable Ally in WikiLeaks</a>, Oct. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/03/world/wikileaks-fast-facts/ \">WikiLeaks Fast Facts</a>, April 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, S<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/white-house-wikileaks-donald-trump-cia-documents/\">picer attacks &#39;double standard&#39; in response to WikiLeaks dump</a>, March 9 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-statement-233297\">Trump says hacking had &#39;no effect on the outcome of the election,&#39;</a> Jan 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/donna-brazile-hillary-clinton-leak-regret-236184\"> Brazile: Leaking town hall topics to Clinton campaign &#39;mistake I will forever regret,</a>&#39; March 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Tracey Manzer, communications director for Rep.
