Bill Nelson, D-Fla., shaking up the Florida governor&rsquo;s race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson has repeatedly said he has no plans to enter, but he hasn&rsquo;t<strong> </strong>flatly ruled out a scenario in which he enters the race if Democratic front-runner Charlie Crist appears to flame out against Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott. A new poll has Crist and Scott tied with 42 percent of the vote, while other polls generally have shown Crist ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday at a luncheon with Daytona Beach business leaders, Nelson zinged Scott for rejecting high-speed rail financed by federal stimulus dollars and not pushing harder for billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid to poor, uninsured residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it&rsquo;s not only a shame,&quot; Nelson said, according to the <em>Daytona Beach News-Journal</em>. &quot;I think it&rsquo;s a moral abscess.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speech generated headlines that Nelson was toying with the idea of running. That, in turn, spawned reaction from <a href=\"http://www.news4jax.com/news/gov-scott-appoints-sen-john-thrasher-as-chairman-of-reelection-campaign/23977348\"><u>Scott&rsquo;s campaign chairman</u></a>, state Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;His solutions are federally based solutions &mdash; not Florida-based solutions,&quot; Thrasher said in criticizing Nelson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why are we writing about any of this at PunditFact?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because MSNBC&rsquo;s <em>Daily Rundown </em>got it mixed up in a segment about the story featuring input from Chuck Todd from Seoul, South Korea, <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> political editor Adam Smith and fill-in host Kristen Welker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Smith noted a concern among Democrats that Crist &quot;could wind up as a train wreck,&quot; Welker noted, &quot;Crist&rsquo;s campaign is actually responding, which is interesting. He says of Bill Nelson, or his campaign chairman says, &lsquo;His solutions are federally based solutions &mdash; not Florida-based solutions.&rsquo; So Crist really feeling the heat here, pushing back. What do you make of that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chart also wrongly referred to Thrasher as Crist&rsquo;s campaign chairman. This is the same man who just this week released a statement saying, &quot;We are very confident in our campaign to show Charlie Crist&#39;s failure as governor in contrast to Gov. Scott&#39;s record of job creation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The segment prompted Crist adviser Kevin Cate to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevinCate/status/459693879617265665/photo/1\"><u> tweet</u></a>, &quot;Correction for<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dailyrundown\"><u> @dailyrundown</u></a>:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/John_Thrasher\"><u> @John_Thrasher</u></a> is not our chair &amp; we didn&#39;t bash Nelson. cc:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd\"><u> @chucktodd</u></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamsmithtimes\"><u> @adamsmithtimes</u></a><a href=\"http://t.co/149Etntdyq\"><u> pic.twitter.com/149Etntdyq</u></a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we began reporting this item, MSNBC acknowledged its mistake:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Bad mix-up on our part w/<a href=\"https://twitter.com/John_Thrasher\">@John_Thrasher</a> quote today.

Crist&rsquo;s campaign chairman did not blast the prospect of Nelson entering the Florida governor&rsquo;s race.
