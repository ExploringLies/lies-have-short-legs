Charlie Crist endorsed President Barack Obama and secured a speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention, Republicans pulled out the Crist files to highlight how much the Republican-turned-independent Crist had changed in just four years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorge LeMieux, a Republican and a former Crist chief of staff, wrote a biting op-ed about Crist&rsquo;s former stances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He never met a tax increase he liked. ... The Charlie Crist I knew idolized Ronald Reagan and embraced Reagan&#39;s view of limited government. He was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax. He believed big government was the enemy of success, and that when government taxed it took &lsquo;your money.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this fact-check we will explore whether Crist was &quot;pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we will note what Crist <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/08/florida-gop-writes-wasserman-schultz-about-crist-133907.html\">said</a> of himself in February 2010: &quot;I am pro-life, I&rsquo;m pro-gun, I&rsquo;m pro-family and I&rsquo;m anti-tax. And I always have been.&quot; He made those claims at a Christian Family Coalition breakfast while running for U.S. Senate as a Republican. He would ditch the GOP label for no-party about two months later as he was struggling in his primary bid against Marco Rubio.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> &quot;Pro-life&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrist&rsquo;s stance on abortion over his political career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even if Crist tried to do that himself at times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen he was running for the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/oct/24/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-fires-back-charlie-crist-attacks/\">U.S. Senate in 1998</a>, Crist said in a questionnaire for the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. &quot;I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government,&quot; he said. Crist said in a debate during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade and opposed a 24-hour waiting period. &quot;I don&#39;t think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it&#39;s very important to respect the medical profession,&quot; said Crist, whose father is a doctor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Crist said he would &quot;fight for pro-life legislative efforts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut later in 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/mar/17/matt-gaetz/taxpayer-funded-abortions-federal-health-care-bill/\">ultrasound</a>. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure &quot;punitive&quot; and that the measure was &quot;almost mean spirited.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> &quot;Pro-gun&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Crist was running for U.S. Senate in 2010, we reviewed a claim that he &quot;never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.&quot; We ruled that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jul/14/charlie-crist/crist-stands-firm-gun-rights/\">True</a> and will briefly review what we found for that article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn one of his first high-profile gun battles, then-state senator Crist blasted Gov. Lawton Chiles&#39; last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998. The legislation proposal died.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs attorney general, Crist nominated <a href=\"http://www.nra.org/Article.aspx?id=1224\">Marion P. Hammer</a>, former president of the National Rifle Association, to the Florida Women&#39;s Hall of Fame, and she was inducted in 2004. Hammer is also the longtime president of the state&rsquo;s NRA affiliate Unified Sportsmen of Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, Crist ran an ad calling Gallagher &quot;anti-gun&quot; and highlighting Crist&rsquo;s endorsement from the NRA. As governor, Crist signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Anti-tax&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo examine Crist&rsquo;s actions about taxes, we reviewed multiple reports from Florida TaxWatch and newspaper articles. We also interviewed staff at Florida TaxWatch as well as Amy Baker, the state&rsquo;s chief economist. Here are some highlights from his tenure as governor:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2007: </strong>Crist repeatedly promised Floridians that their taxes would &quot;drop like a rock.&quot; Crist and the Legislature attempted to deliver that through a question put to voters, Amendment 1, which increased the homestead property tax exemption. Voters approved it in January 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, said that taxes didn&rsquo;t really drop like a rock but &quot;there was some reduction in them.&quot; But much of that happened due to the decline in property values.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his <a href=\"http://www.floridataxwatch.org/resources/pdf/022007BudgetWatch.pdf\">first proposed budget</a> in 2007, Crist called for continuing sales tax holidays and reducing the communications services tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2008: </strong>Crist&rsquo;s budget<a href=\"http://www.floridataxwatch.org/resources/pdf/01312008BudgetWatch.pdf\"> proposal</a> suggested dealing with a drop in revenues by using reserves and trust funds. He recommended two more sales tax holidays, one for hurricane<br />\r\n\tpreparedness and one for back-to-school, a savings to taxpayers of $36 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2009: </strong>Crist&rsquo;s budget didn&rsquo;t call for general tax hikes, but he did ultimately support a $1 a pack cigarette tax hike and surcharge on other tobacco products. That tax hike added up to about $1 billion a year, said Dominic Calabro, president of Florida TaxWatch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrist also signed a budget that included <a href=\"http://www.floridataxwatch.org/resources/pdf/02212009BWGovernorsRecommendedBudget.pdf\">new fees</a> including a package of increased and new Highway Safety Fees for about $1 billion in recurring dollars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Miami Herald </em>quoted Crist as saying: &quot;The cigarette tax is appropriate and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue.&#39;&#39;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf Crist had vetoed the cigarette tax, the state would have lost nearly $2 billion in federal Medicaid matching funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe<em> Tampa Bay Times </em>wrote that Crist would call taxes the &quot;T-word&quot; as if it was an obscenity but would warm up if called a &quot;user fee.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2010: </strong>TaxWatch wrote that Crist&rsquo;s budget proposal in <a href=\"http://www.floridataxwatch.org/resources/pdf/11012010AnnualReport.pdf\">January 2010</a> called for $2.7 billion in increased spending and $100 million in tax cuts by relying on federal money, Seminole gambling Compact and raiding trust funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalabro said that Crist could have done more to reign in spending during his tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Wenner said that &quot;generally throughout his career (Crist) was in favor of reducing taxes for the average Floridian.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeMieux said that Gov. Charlie Crist &quot;was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.&quot; Crist did describe himself in similar language in 2010 while he was still a Republican and running for U.S. Senate. And we agree that he was consistently for gun rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis record on abortion was more mixed. At different times, he called himself &quot;pro-life&quot; and he called himself &quot;pro-choice.&quot; And even when he called himself &quot;pro-life&quot; in 2006, he said he would not support overturning Roe vs. Wade. In 2010, he earned cheers from abortion rights supporters when he vetoed a bill that would force women who are getting abortions to undergo an ultrasound.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrist portrayed himself as anti-tax and generally avoided tax increases, although he did support the cigarette tax hike and other increases in fees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the whole, we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.
