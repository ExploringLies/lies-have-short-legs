He was scornful of a proposal by Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to raise the debt limit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Harry Reid&rsquo;s plan is basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants,&quot; Cantor said during a July 26 <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/transcript/cantor-obama039s-039playing-bully-politics039-and-039we039re-calling-his-bluff039\">interview </a>on Fox News.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered whether Reid&rsquo;s plan really would present President Barack Obama a blank check -- a claim repeatedly made by Cantor and Boehner. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a little background. Reid&rsquo;s proposal would raise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion, enough to last until 2013. Boehner&rsquo;s two-step plan&nbsp;would allow the limit to increase by $900 billion now and force Obama to seek a second hike before next year&rsquo;s elections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth proposals claim to cut spending by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Neither plan seeks a tax increase. Boehner would require Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment; Reid would not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor&rsquo;s deputy press secretary, to explain the majority leader&rsquo;s factual basis for calling Reid&rsquo;s plan &quot;a blank check&quot; for Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We are confident that your readers will understand the common meaning of the metaphor of a `blank check,&rsquo;&quot; she e-mailed back to us. &quot;However, to help you along we first turn to About.com in the grammar section where you will find the following helpful.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhittemore pasted in a three-paragraph definition that began, &quot;A figure of speech is a rhetorical device that achieves a special effect by using words in distinctive ways.&quot; It said, among other things, that sometimes people rely on &quot;hyperbole to emphasize a point (`I&rsquo;m starving!&rsquo;).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe also sent us two definitions of &quot;blank check.&quot; One, <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blank+check\">by Dictionary.com</a>, defines it as &quot;unrestricted authority; a free hand.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_cheque\">by Wikipedia</a>, says blank check &quot;in the figurative or metaphoric sense, is used (especially in politics) to describe a situation in which an agreement had been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhittemore noted that Boehner&rsquo;s two-step plan would require Congress to hit spending-cut goals before Obama could ask Congress for the second increase in the debt. That, Republicans say, would put more pressure on Washington to reduce spending than Reid&rsquo;s proposal, which would allow a larger, longer-lasting hike in the debt cap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ran Cantor&rsquo;s &quot;blank check&quot; analogy by four Washington policy analysts who are closely watching the debt ceiling debate. They were all perplexed by the statement and pointed out a simple reason why Reid&rsquo;s plan would not give Obama carte blanche: Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can appropriate money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Congress has to authorize new spending and changes in taxation,&quot; said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. &quot;The president can sign or veto those bills. He can&rsquo;t do anything without congressional authority.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrnstein added, &quot;Cantor is being totally, deliberately misleading.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteve Ellis, vice-president of the non-partisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, had a similar take. &quot;Rep. Cantor&rsquo;s comment isn&rsquo;t really correct,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were also given a second reason why Cantor&rsquo;s statement is inaccurate: Raising the debt limit will pay for past obligations made by the U.S. government, not new ones.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The need to raise the debt limit is a factor of past spending and tax decision (in addition to the recent economic downturn) enacted by previous congresses and presidents pushing borrowing needs up,&quot; said Jason Peuquet, an analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road, budget-hawk group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor said Senate Majority Leader Reid&rsquo;s proposal to raise the debt ceiling would be &quot;basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA number of policy analysts told us Cantor&rsquo;s statement is simply incorrect. Only Congress can appropriate money. Obama can only spend what he&rsquo;s given. Reid&rsquo;s plan does not change that constitutional requirement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor&rsquo;s office failed to provide a single fact to back the Republican&rsquo;s contention that Reid&rsquo;s proposal would give the president a free hand in spending. Cantor&rsquo;s spokeswoman said he was speaking metaphorically and people understand that. We find that logic hard to accept, particularly at a time of great public divide when the financial integrity of the nation is at stake.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Cantor&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-29T11:59:09.778764", "ruling_date": "2011-07-29T12:55:38", "ruling_headline": "Cantor says Reid debt proposal gives \"blank check\" to Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "cantor-says-reid-debt-proposal-gives-blank-check-o", "ruling_link_text": "Was speaking metaphorically", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFox News, Cantor: Obama;s <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/transcript/cantor-obama039s-039playing-bully-politics039-and-039we039re-calling-his-bluff039\">&quot;Playing Bully Politics&quot; and &quot;We&rsquo;re Calling His Bluff,&quot;</a>&nbsp;July 26, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Megan Whittemore, Deputy press secretary for Rep.
