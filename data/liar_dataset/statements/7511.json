So this has a big impact on the financial security of our women.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA reader asked us on Facebook about the statistic -- that nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage earners are women. We thought it was an interesting fact to check, and it turns out Pelosi is right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe best source for this information is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles data from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2012tbls.htm#7\">BLS figures</a> show there were slightly more than 3.5 million men and women earning minimum wage or less in 2012, and nearly 2.3 million women at those wage levels. So dividing the total by the women workers gets you to 64.4 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s interesting to note, however, that people earning the minimum wage account for a very small percentage of people working -- &nbsp;in this case, 2.6 percent of working women.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPelosi said 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment figures from 2012, which are based on census data, back up her assertion. We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-13T13:49:33.543633", "ruling_date": "2013-03-13T13:49:07", "ruling_headline": "Nancy Pelosi says 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women", "ruling_headline_slug": "nancy-pelosi-says-64-percent-minimum-wage-earners-", "ruling_link_text": "She's on target", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tHouse Minority Leader Pelosi Holds Weekly News Conference, March 7, 2013, transcript via CQ.com<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Hill</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/286795-pelosi-urges-minimum-wage-hike\">Pelosi urges minimum-wage hike</a>,&quot; March 7, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2012tbls.htm#content\">Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers: 2012</a>,&quot; accessed March 12, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Drew Hammill, spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, March 13, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter for American Progress, &quot;<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/02/13/1591791/minimum-wage-women-charts/\">Why The Minimum Wage Is A Women&rsquo;s Issue, In Three Charts</a>,&quot; Feb. 13, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "House Minority Leader", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Nancy ", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "California", "id": 59, "last_name": "Pelosi", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "nancy-pelosi", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-nancypelosi.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/59/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;More than 64 percent of minimum-wage earners are women.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news conference", "statement_date": "2013-03-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
