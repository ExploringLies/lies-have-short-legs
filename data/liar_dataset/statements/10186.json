Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican locked in an unexpectedly tight race against independent Greg Orman. Roberts has struggled despite his status as an incumbent in a super conservative state, a headache of a situation for Republicans who want to flip control of the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a clear worst candidate this year. It&rsquo;s Pat Roberts,&quot; ABC White House correspondent Jonathan Karl said on <em>This Week</em>. &quot;I mean, Kansas has not elected somebody other than a Republican since before<em> The Wizard of Oz</em> hit the movie theaters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classic film that opens with a tornado sweeping through a Kansas farm made its debut 75 years ago in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>1939</u></a>. Has it really been that long since Kansas elected someone who wasn&rsquo;t a Republican to the U.S. Senate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s been longer. Eighty-two years, to be exact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last Democratic senator the state sent to Washington was <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000447\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>George McGill</u></a>, a lawyer from Wichita who served from 1930-39. After winning a 1932 election, McGill lost his 1938 re-election bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only other Democratic senators from Kansas were <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000185\">John Martin</a>, who filled out the remainder of a deceased senator&rsquo;s term from 1893-95, and <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000226\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>William Howard Thompson</u></a>, who served from 1913-19, according to the <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000258\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Two</u></a> <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000188\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kansas</u></a> senators served as members of the Populist Party, though both were elected at the turn of the century well before <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> movie release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other 28 senators were all Republicans, including Roberts, who won his first election to Congress in 1981 and his first U.S. Senate race in 1996.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an incumbent such as Roberts to be in such a vulnerable position is highly unusual, said Burdett Loomis, professor of political science at the University of Kansas. Winning a seat in the U.S. Senate from Kansas has been mostly very easy for Republicans. The GOP has long dominated all layers of Kansas politics, with the state last voting for a Democratic candidate for president in 1964. (A notable recent exception is when Kathleen Sebelius won the governor&#39;s race as a Democrat in 2002 and 2006.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In that context, it&rsquo;s just very weird because this is about as favorable an environment for a Republican as you can get,&quot; Loomis said, &quot;and it&rsquo;s also supposed to be a good year for Republicans across the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberts was weakened early in his re-election bid by a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/senator-races-to-show-ties-including-an-address-in-kansas.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> that revealed he does not have a home of his own in Kansas. He survived his primary despite tea party criticisms that he is a Washington insider. His attacks against Orman have largely failed and he has focused more on criticizing President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid than documenting his<strong> </strong>own achievements, Loomis said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think Roberts could have more easily won a conventional race,&quot; Loomis said. &quot;Running against an independent, it really is harder.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Kansas is usually a reliably conservative state, the state&rsquo;s share of residents who identify as moderates (36 percent) is about the same as those who say they are conservative at 38 percent, according to a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/177821/kansas-gop-numbers-advantage-support-drops.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gallup </u></a>analysis. This could be one reason Orman is doing well in pre-election polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, according to Gallup, Kansas is on the low end of the 10 reddest states in terms of residents who describe their political ideology as conservative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Roberts-Orman race is considered a toss-up by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/ks/kansas_senate_roberts_vs_orman-5216.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Real Clear Politics</u></a> and <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/senate/charts/race-ratings\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Cook Political Report</u></a>. Nate Silver&rsquo;s FiveThirtyEight.com gives Orman a <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/senate-forecast/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>54 percent chance</u></a> of winning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking about the midterm campaign with the most blunders, Karl said Roberts is the &quot;clear worst candidate of the year,&quot; pointing to the fact that &quot;Kansas has not elected somebody other than a Republican since before<em> The Wizard of Oz</em> hit the movie theaters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karl&rsquo;s talking point is on the money.
