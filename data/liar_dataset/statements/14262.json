But the amount will likely be in the same ballpark as its scoring of the House bill, which cut taxes by about $1 trillion over 10 years, with high-income households and the health care industry gaining most of those benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate bill repeals Affordable Care Act taxes that levy a 3.8 percent fee on investment income, as well as a tax on individuals making $200,000 or more ($250,000 for couples).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill also eliminates ACA taxes that target health insurers, and makers of prescription drugs and medical devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also note that middle- and lower-income consumers would likely see benefits from tax cuts in the form of lower prices and reduced fees on health savings accounts, as we pointed out in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/21/mark-pocan/americas-wealthiest-get-600-billion-tax-breaks-rep/\">an earlier check of a House version of the bill</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Tax cuts paid for by cutting health care</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama is correct that tax cuts would be offset by cutting spending on health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s a stretch to say <em>everybody&rsquo;s</em> health care would suffer, when what&rsquo;s on the chopping block is federal funding for lower-income Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the individual market, the Senate bill changes the formula for calculating how much help the federal government gives lower-income Americans to buy insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared with&nbsp;the Obamacare formula, the Senate GOP version would amount to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/877901302696525824\">15 percent across-the-board cut</a> in premium subsidies, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/877903687921709056\">result in</a> low-income people paying higher premiums for bigger deductibles, according to Larry Levitt,&nbsp;senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care think tank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting in 2020, the Senate bill also repeals Obamacare&rsquo;s cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income Americans defray the cost of deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the biggest cut in federal spending comes out of Medicaid, by changing the share carried by the federal government, relative to states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate bill converts federal Medicaid funding to a per capita cap starting in 2020, placing a ceiling on the amount of funding a state gets per enrollee. Alternatively, states could opt for a block grant, a fixed amount of federal funds. Under either approach, the federal government would provide less to states than under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, starting in 2021, the Senate bill begins a three-year phase out of enhanced funding given to the 31 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. As we noted in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/09/kevin-mccarthy/would-republican-health-care-bill-take-away-anyone/\">previous check of the House bill</a>, reducing this funding would likely cause states to end expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xrLEtMdQ0rkgL3Pvh2lHjN7yaBmcIeiiGp0fPekQsZVJqEPfZXT32xw_rw3oIng14FJmTtLqgsqKe3N0BwnCXtREL1u9L28zcCQX_7NrdhNCW0X0Xy1mhN077LnqhhTIKTGFAE8f\" style=\"border:none; float:left; height:407px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; width:340px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This graphic from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a side-by-side illustration of Obama&rsquo;s claim that Republicans are rewarding wealthy Americans through a health care cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yellow bar shows $33 billion going to the top 400 highest-income households as a result of repealing the Obamacare tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The red bar shows how removing $33 billion in revenue translates to cutting off funding for Medicaid expansion population of four states\u2015Alaska, Arkansas, West Virginia and Nevada. (Note: This graphic is based on the CBO&rsquo;s earlier score of the House version, which will likely differ from its score of the Senate).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said that&nbsp;the Senate bill &quot;hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate bill does give a tax cut to wealthy Americans and medical-related industry. Assuming a budget analysis of the Senate bill is similar to that of the House version, the tax cut will be to the tune of $1 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bit hyperbolic to say everybody&rsquo;s health care would be cut to finance the tax cut; it&rsquo;s mostly lower-income people who lose out as a direct result of the bill. He&rsquo;s right that the Senate bill would deliver a tax cut as it reduces the amount of federal funding lower-income Americans would get to help buy insurance. The bill would also repeal funding to defray deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for those eligible. It also lessens the share of Medicaid funding carried by the federal government, relative to states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Obama&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-26T13:42:53.615046", "ruling_date": "2017-06-26T16:18:02", "ruling_headline": "Obama blasts GOP Senate bill as tax cut for the rich at health care\u2019s expense", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-blasts-gop-senate-bill-tax-cut-rich-health-c", "ruling_link_text": "Robin Hood in reverse", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10154996557026749\">Facebook</a> post by Barack Obama, June 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kff.org/interactive/proposals-to-replace-the-affordable-care-act/\">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, &quot;Compare Proposals to Replace The Affordable Care Act&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tax-pieces-senate-health-bill-look-lot-houses\">Tax Policy Center</a>, &quot;The Tax Pieces of The Senate Health Bill Look A Lot Like The House&#39;s,&quot; June 22, 2017&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/research/health/harsh-tradeoff-at-core-of-gop-health-bill-keep-medicaid-expansion-or-cut-taxes-for\">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, &quot;Harsh Tradeoff at Core of GOP Health Bill: Keep Medicaid Expansion or Cut Taxes for Wealthy?&quot; June 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/09/kevin-mccarthy/would-republican-health-care-bill-take-away-anyone/\">PolitiFact</a></em>, &quot;Would the Republican health care bill take away anyone&rsquo;s Medicaid?&quot; May 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/21/mark-pocan/americas-wealthiest-get-600-billion-tax-breaks-rep/\"><em>PolitiFact</em></a>, &quot;Only the wealthiest would get $600 billion in tax breaks from &#39;Trumpcare&#39; replacement for Obamacare?&quot; March 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/877901302696525824\">Tweet</a> by Larry Levitt, senior vice president of Kaiser Family Fund, June 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/877903687921709056\">Tweet</a> by Larry Levitt, senior vice president of Kaiser Family Fund, June 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Eric Schultz, spokesman for former President Barack Obama, June 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Timothy Jost, a health-care policy expert at Washington &amp; Lee law school, June 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Katherine Hempstead, senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, June 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Paul Ginsburg, University of Southern California professor of the practice of health policy and management, June 22, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>The Senate bill &quot;hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Facebook post", "statement_date": "2017-06-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
