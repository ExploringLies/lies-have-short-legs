Maxine Waters, D.-Calif., of being an absentee congresswoman for decades relied on a fake statistic from a thread on Reddit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS,&quot; read the headline on a <a href=\"https://teddystick.com/democrat-maxine-waters-has-shown-up-to-only-10-of-congressional-meetings-for-35-years/\">June 7, 2017, post on TeddyStick.com</a>. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website, which doesn&rsquo;t list contact information and has <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/teddystick.com\">hidden its registration data</a>, attacked Waters, an African-American woman, for allegedly inciting racial strife and refusing to do her job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The writer, who is credited on the post as Sam Di Gangi, wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that &#39;Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source is simply a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6fq4j3/over_her_35_years_in_congress_maxine_waters_has/\">Reddit thread from June 7, 2017</a>, which contains no evidence at all. It&rsquo;s just a series of comments posted on Reddit&rsquo;s &quot;the_donald&quot; forum. We contacted a Waters spokesman, who chose not to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waters is a long-serving legislator, but she hasn&rsquo;t been in Congress for 35 years. She first started representing a California district in 1991, so she&rsquo;s been in Washington for 26 years. She became a state legislator in 1977 and served until joining the U.S. House of Representatives, which amounts to 40 years of lawmaking experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond that, it&rsquo;s wrong to say Waters missed 90 percent of her &quot;congressional meetings,&quot; even though exactly how those those meetings are defined isn&rsquo;t specified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible the post referred to her voting record, but that would be way off. As a commenter on the Reddit thread noted, GovTrack.us notes Waters has <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/maxine_waters/400422\">missed 7.6 percent of her votes</a> since January 1991. That&rsquo;s higher than the 2.2 percent average among all House members, but nowhere near a 90 percent absentee rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistic also could mean all her committee meetings, but that isn&rsquo;t right, either. Of course, no member of Congress attends every single hearing, but the <em>Washington Examiner</em> did analyze meeting records for members of Congress in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waters was not among the 20 highest absentee rates, which was comprised of 12 Republicans and eight Democrats. U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas, D-Mass., came in first, missing 96 percent of hearings in the <em>Examiner</em>&rsquo;s analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spot-checked Waters&rsquo; 2015-16 record as ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services, which also gives her <a href=\"http://corg.indiana.edu/congressional-glossary#ExOfficio\">ex officio status</a> on a half-dozen subcommittees, meaning Waters could attend meetings for those subcommittees if she chose. By our count, Waters missed <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CHRG&amp;browsePath=114%2FHOUSE%2FCommittee+on+Financial+Services&amp;isCollapsed=false&amp;leafLevelBrowse=false&amp;isDocumentResults=true&amp;ycord=0\">37 percent of the hearings</a> listed on the Government Publishing Office&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence Waters attended a paltry 10 percent of meetings, however you count them. TeddyStick.com used a dubious source that appeared to have just made up the stat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-15T14:00:46.247137", "ruling_date": "2017-06-15T14:26:49", "ruling_headline": "Maxine Waters has not skipped 90 percent of congressional meetings", "ruling_headline_slug": "maxine-waters-has-not-skipped-90-percent-congressi", "ruling_link_text": "Blog post skipped real research", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>TeddyStick.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://teddystick.com/democrat-maxine-waters-has-shown-up-to-only-10-of-congressional-meetings-for-35-years/\">Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS</a>,&quot; June 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reddit, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6fq4j3/over_her_35_years_in_congress_maxine_waters_has/\">Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.</a>,&quot; June 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Examiner</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/many-house-members-miss-more-than-two-thirds-of-their-committee-meetings/article/2553905\">Many House members miss more than two-thirds of their committee meetings</a>,&quot; Sept. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government Publishing Office, <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CHRG&amp;browsePath=114%2FHOUSE%2FCommittee+on+Financial+Services&amp;isCollapsed=false&amp;leafLevelBrowse=false&amp;isDocumentResults=true&amp;ycord=0\">Committee on Financial Services hearings</a>, accessed June 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GovTrack.us, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/maxine_waters/400422\">U.S. Rep.
