When his actions came to light in the wake of the salmonella crisis, he was fired.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe inspector, Gaylon Armonett, told the Associated Press the reason he checked &quot;yes&quot; the first time was that a plant manager told him an application for state health licensing had been completed and was in the hands of officials at the company&#39;s headquarters. Armonett said he checked &quot;yes&quot; in the succeeding years because he assumed the license was granted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s an inadvertent mistake,&quot; Armonett said, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry for it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgriculture department spokesman Bryan Black suggested it wasn&rsquo;t the department&rsquo;s responsibility to police any plant&rsquo;s cleanliness. &quot;Local and state health departments are responsible for protecting consumers from food-borne illnesses,&quot; Black said. &quot;TDA certifies products and processes to national organic standards and has strict protocols in place.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed that firms like the peanut plant that manufacture food for sale to the public must have a state-issued food manufacturer license. The agency has said it didn&rsquo;t know of the Plainview plant until the salmonella outbreak. The plant closed in February.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We never received an application for a license,&quot; DSHS spokeswoman Allison Lowery said. &quot;As you can understand, it would be very difficult for us to know about a company when it fails to license with us.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tLowery continued: &quot;As soon as we were aware of the problems... we immediately ordered the company to close this plant and recall all products made there. We also quickly took over the recall after we got no response from the company to our recall order. And we assessed $14.6 million in administrative penalties against the company.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn his statement about the peanut plant, Gilbert overstates the agriculture department&#39;s role; it&#39;s not the primary agency responsible for policing such facilities for health hazards. Still, its inspector admittedly slipped up in this case. If he&#39;d flagged the Plainview plant for lacking the required food manufacturer license, it might have been shut down or its conditions improved. That could have prevented the 2009 illnesses and deaths.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Gilbert&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:55:45.855744", "ruling_date": "2010-01-12T15:28:04", "ruling_headline": "Hank Gilbert says agency's inadequate oversight allowed salmonella-related deaths, illnesses", "ruling_headline_slug": "hank-gilbert-says-agencys-lax-attitude-allowed-sal", "ruling_link_text": "Challenger overlooked health department role", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAssociated Press, &quot;For years, inspector in peanut case made error,&quot; The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, VA.), March 6, 2009 (Nexis Search)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mails, Bryan Black, assistant commissioner for communications, Texas Department of Agriculture, Dec. 22, 2009, Jan. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview and e-mail, Allison Lowery, assistant press officer, Texas Department of State Health Services, Jan. 12, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLubbock Avalanche-Journal,<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/021109/loc_386768548.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal article\">&quot;Plainview peanut plant closes amid finding of possible salmonella,&quot;</a> Feb. 11, 2009, viewed Jan. 4, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPress release, Hank Gilbert campaign, <a href=\"http://hankgilbert.com/2009/12/gilbert-welcomes-kinky/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hank Gilbert press release\">&quot;Friedman&#39;s Entry Into Ag Commissioner Race Another Example Of Self-Promotion By Entertainer,&quot;</a> Dec. 14, 2009</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTexas Department of State Health Services, <a href=\"http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/foods/foodmangen.shtm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Texas Department of State Health Services\">&quot;Food Manufacturers General Information,&quot;</a> accessed Jan. 6, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/business/14peanut.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New York Times article\">&quot;Troubled Peanut Company Files for Bankruptcy Protection,&quot;</a> Feb. 14, 2009</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Cattle raiser", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Hank", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 289, "last_name": "Gilbert", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "hank-gilbert", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Gilbertmug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/289/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://hankgilbert.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays a careless attitude and &quot;poor oversight by the Texas Department of Agriculture&quot; led to deaths and illnesses traced to a Texas peanut plant.</p>", "statement_context": "in a press release", "statement_date": "2009-12-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 122, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/122/", "subject": "Agriculture", "subject_slug": "agriculture", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 28, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/28/", "subject": "Consumer Safety", "subject_slug": "consumer-safety", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "state agriculture commissioner", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Todd", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 290, "last_name": "Staples", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "todd-staples", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/staples.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/290/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.toddstaples.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
