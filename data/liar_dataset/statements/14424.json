Tolerating bigotry in silence is no virtue; taking it on is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad discusses an event that actually happened but distorts reality. We&rsquo;ll explain why.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Here&rsquo;s what happened at the forum</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/mayoral-forum-has-small-surprises-but-avoids-major-mishaps/2330813\">July 18</a>, six mayoral candidates gathered in the City Council chambers to participate in a mayoral forum moderated by St. Petersburg&rsquo;s League of Women Voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The forum had a unique format that didn&rsquo;t allow for debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some questions were addressed to all six candidates, and other questions were only addressed to half of the panel. If a question was only addressed to half of the panel, then a candidate who was not asked could wave a &quot;wildcard&quot; to signal that he or she wanted to answer the question. Candidates were given three wildcards and were told that there would be no opportunities for rebuttals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first 30 minutes, the forum went on without a hitch. That changed when Congemi used his wildcard to respond to a question about how to provide recreational activities for youth in the city. The question was only addressed to Theresa &quot;Momma Tee&quot; Lassiter, Kriseman, and <a href=\"http://jessenevel.com/meet_jesse/\">Jesse Nevel</a>, national chairman of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, which helps&nbsp;organizes white support for black-led community social justice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mr. Nevel, you and your people, you talk about reparations,&quot; Congemi said. &quot;The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid boos from the crowd, Congemi added: &quot;My advice to you, my advice to you, if you don&rsquo;t like it here in America, planes leave every hour. Go back to Africa, go back to Africa.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman was seated next to Congemi. As Congemi talked about reparations, Kriseman can be seen with sealed lips, looking around. Another angle shows Kriseman glancing at the crowd and then looking at Congemi during parts of his outburst.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After Congemi&rsquo;s remarks the crowd continued to bellow in opposition and Nevel called Congemi a &quot;nonfactor&quot;, but it settled after candidate Anthony Cates III, who is African-American, used his wildcard. He did not address what Congemi said, talking instead about a charity he worked with that helped students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Cates spoke, the moderator asked all six candidates how they would approach the homeless population. Kriseman was the first to answer, and he didn&rsquo;t mention Congemi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman said his administration had invested money to help family homelessness in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question then went to Lassiter and Nevel, who also didn&rsquo;t mention what Congemi said (though Nevel did dismiss him as a &quot;nonfactor&quot; in the midst of Congemi&rsquo;s rant).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when it was Baker&rsquo;s turn to talk, he called out Congemi.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I know we&rsquo;re not supposed to respond to other things, but I first have to specifically reject the comments Mr. Congemi just made,&quot; Baker said. &quot;I just think in 2017 in St. Petersburg, Florida, I never would have dreamed&nbsp;we would&#39;ve heard comments like that at a mayoral debate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That <a href=\"http://www.fox13news.com/news/local-news/268750169-story\">night</a>, Twitter erupted with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanAxelbank/status/887481553902862338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fpost-nation%2Fwp%2F2017%2F07%2F19%2Ffla-mayoral-candidate-had-a-message-for-activists-who-want-reparations-go-back-to-africa%2F\">video</a> of Congemi&rsquo;s remarks, and the <em>Washington Post </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/19/fla-mayoral-candidate-had-a-message-for-activists-who-want-reparations-go-back-to-africa/?utm_term=.ce89df21099a\">wrote</a> about the situation early the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A little past noon on July 19, Kriseman rejected the racist remarks on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kriseman/status/887733069628813314\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Kriseman/posts/1649145048429889\">Facebook</a>, and in a <a href=\"https://www.iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=2b1ab179-b99f-4cc5-b0b3-9a8fa2968165&amp;ps=2\">television</a> interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is simply unacceptable to spew this kind of bigoted rhetoric,&quot; he said. &quot;Free speech should not compromise the dignity and respect of any person or community&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said he didn&rsquo;t want to bring more attention to the remarks at the time, adding that he regretted not speaking out then and there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was reluctant to engage this candidate last night and draw even more attention to his disturbing message,&quot; Kriseman wrote on Facebook. &quot;I regret not doing so, though.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Congemi&rsquo;s last runs for mayor only garnered a few hundred votes. In 2009, Congemi referred to homosexuality as an &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nexis.com/docview/getDocForCuiReq?oc=00240&amp;lni=5323-4ND1-JBRN-H47V&amp;perma=true&amp;csi=280434&amp;secondRedirectIndicator=true\">abomination</a>&quot; and spoke out against the St. Pete Pride festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman&rsquo;s campaign said he has a long record of standing up against discrimination and pointed to his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Kriseman/posts/1657395314271529\">record</a> of <a href=\"http://www.stpete.org/mayor-speeches-remarks-detail_T38_R12.php\">denouncing</a> President Donald Trump&#39;s&nbsp;decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military as well as his proposal during the campaign to <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/baybuzz/mayor-rick-kriseman-bars-donald-trump-from-st-petersburg/2256877\">ban Muslims</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A television ad paid for by Rick Baker&rsquo;s PAC said he condemned racist comments from another candidate while Kriseman &quot;just looked away.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker did speak up during the mayoral forum. In doing so, he acknowledged that he was going against the organizers&rsquo; rules by not sticking to the question at hand and revisiting earlier comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman did not comment on what Congemi said that night. Neither did four other candidates at the forum. Kriseman waited until the next day, and was criticized for it. He said he did not want to bring more attention to the message in the moment but regretted not doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The admaker misleads viewers by neglecting to include Kriseman&#39;s later condemnation of what Congemi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ad is partially accurate but omits substantial information about what happened.
