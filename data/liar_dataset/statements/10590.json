Scott Walker&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">presidential star continued to rise</a>, Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, challenged him on how his budget treats the University of Wisconsin System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You cut funding, state funding for the University of Wisconsin higher education system by 13 percent. You cut funding for the state parks system by 28 percent,&quot; Wallace said during the March 1, 2015 interview. &quot;Governor, are those your priorities?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker responded by noting that critics said his 2011 budget cuts would devastate K-12 education, but graduation rates and reading scores are up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That led to this exchange:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WALLACE:</strong> <em>But the University of Wisconsin says they&#39;re going to have to raise tuition on students.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WALKER:</strong> <em>But they&#39;re not. We have a two-year tuition freeze.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WALLACE:</strong> <em>I know, but they&#39;re saying after that.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WALKER:</strong> <em>Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation. And so, we will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At issue are fears that big tuition hikes could be coming after 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They stem from Walker&rsquo;s proposed Walker&rsquo;s tuition freeze between 2015 and 2017, which would stymie UW from raising more revenue via tuition to replace the $300 million aid cut the governor wants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker is saying a big tuition increase won&rsquo;t happen, and that UW schools will be near the top in affordability nationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s hit the books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for Our American Revival, a group Walker formed as he explores a 2016 presidential bid, to back up Walker&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She pointed us to 2014-&rsquo;15 figures for tuition and fees at universities in other states compared with UW-Madison and at four-year public universities in Wisconsin as a group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers come from a good source -- the <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing\">College Board&rsquo;s survey</a> of college pricing trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Wisconsin is right in the middle of the pack or somewhat worse by various measures, the numbers show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- All four-year schools: Among the states, Wisconsin&rsquo;s average cost of in-state tuition and fees at these schools -- the &quot;sticker price&quot; at least -- ranked 26th highest. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Flagship campuses: UW-Madison tuition and fees ranked 22nd highest compared to flagship campuses in the other 49 states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Two-year campuses: Wisconsin&rsquo;s costs ranked 15th highest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among four-year schools in the Big Ten (now with 14 schools), Nebraska, Iowa and Maryland charged less in 2014-&rsquo;15 than Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A gap of $2,000 to $3,000 a year separates Wisconsin and the least expensive states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, nobody knows how the tuition rankings will look down the road after Walker&rsquo;s freeze. But it would take a lot more than a freeze to put Wisconsin near the most affordable states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cap on tuition?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next let&rsquo;s look at Walker&rsquo;s contention that &quot;Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor&rsquo;s pending 2015-&rsquo;17 budget plan would freeze tuition for the two years -- but it applies only to that period. Wallace, though, specifically asked about what happens after that. So that was the period Walker was citing when he referenced a &quot;cap&quot; going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker did <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-opens-door-to-uw-system-tuition-cap-after-2017-b99443872z1-291673721.html\">suggest in February 2015 during a trade mission to the United Kingdom </a>that he was &quot;open&quot; to the notion of putting an inflationary lid on tuition past 2016-&rsquo;17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea drew criticism from UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who said it contradicted Walker&rsquo;s plan to spin off the UW System as an independent authority with control over its budget and more ability to find efficiencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, no ongoing cap is in place. It&rsquo;s not even formally introduced anywhere and Walker said he had no specific plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s not nearly the done deal Walker made it sound like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said the University of Wisconsin schools &quot;will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America&quot; because &quot;going forward we have a cap on it tied to inflation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His evidence is current rankings, but they show the state is neither high nor low for student costs. And the inflationary cap the governor mentioned remains only a gleam in his eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-06T11:35:34.973420", "ruling_date": "2015-03-09T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker: UW tuition will be lower than \"just about any other campus\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-uw-tuition-will-be-lower-just-about-a", "ruling_link_text": "On average, we're average", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2015/03/01/gov-walker-cpac-record-wisconsin-rep-scalise-talks-dhs-funding-fight#p//v/4087171184001\">video and transcript</a> of appearance by Gov.
