Spicer, in his daily press briefing on Jan. 30, 2017, pushed back by claiming that the presidential memorandum announcing the makeup of the council hadn&rsquo;t really changed dramatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The language that&#39;s part of the president&#39;s memo is identical to the language for Presidents Bush&#39;s 2001,&quot; Spicer said, holding up copies of the various memos (<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?423194-1/sean-spicer-briefs-reporters-white-house&amp;start=411\">around the 6:55 mark of this video</a>). &quot;The only thing that&#39;s changed in this is the addition of the Director of National Intelligence as a position that didn&#39;t exist in 2001. For what it&#39;s worth, it&#39;s the same as Obama&#39;s, save for the word &lsquo;also.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, the National Security Council was established in 1947 and gathers foreign and domestic policy and military officials to advise the president on national security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two issues with Trump&rsquo;s restructuring concern the makeup of the full council and its principals committee, a subset of senior officials that is also &quot;literally 100 percent the same,&quot; according to Spicer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is Spicer right that the Bush, Obama and Trump memos are nearly &quot;identical&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We read <a href=\"https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-1.htm\">Bush&rsquo;s 2001 memo</a>, <a href=\"https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/ppd/ppd-1.pdf\">Obama&rsquo;s 2009 memo</a> and Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/28/presidential-memorandum-organization-national-security-council-and\">2017 memo</a>, and found that Spicer&rsquo;s claim is misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The regular council</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer is right about the makeup of the full National Security Council, albeit in a limited way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sentence &mdash; &quot;The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings&quot; &mdash; appears pretty much verbatim in each president&rsquo;s memo. (The Director of National Intelligence was a<a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ODNI%20Fact%20Sheet_2011.pdf\"> position created in 2004</a>, so Bush&rsquo;s memo says the CIA Director instead.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in a broader sense, Spicer is off the mark. Each president has invited different government officials to sit on the council, but neither Bush nor Obama added his chief strategist. Trump appears to be the only president since the establishment of the council to include his, Bannon, <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL30840.pdf\">according to a Congressional Research Service report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL30840.pdf\">By statute</a>, the members of the council are the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of defense and, as of 2007, secretary of energy. As noted in the memos, the chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor are statutory advisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the additional members each president has requested to join the council (positions unique to each president are bolded):</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Bush 2001</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Obama 2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Trump 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&quot;Regular attendees&quot; or &quot;members&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Secretary of treasury</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; National security adviser</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Secretary of treasury</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; National security adviser</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Secretary of homeland security</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Homeland security adviser</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Representative to the United Nations</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Chief of staff</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&bull; Deputy national security adviser</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Secretary of treasury</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; National security adviser</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Secretary of homeland security</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Homeland security adviser</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Representative to the United Nations</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&quot;Invited to attend any meeting&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Chief of staff</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Economic adviser</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Counsel to the president</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Chief of staff</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&bull; Chief strategist (Bannon)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Counsel to the president</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&bull; Deputy counsel for national security</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Director of the Office of Management and Budget</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Invited when appropriate</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Counsel to president</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Attorney general</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Director of the Office of Management and Budget</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Secretary of &nbsp;commerce</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; U.S. Trade representative</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Economic adviser</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&bull; Chair of Council of Economic Advisors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&bull;</strong> Homeland security adviser</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>&bull; Director of the Office of Science and Technology</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Secretary of &nbsp;commerce</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; U.S. Trade representative</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&bull; Economic adviser</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The principals committee</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Bannon&rsquo;s addition to the principals committee undercuts Spicer&rsquo;s claim that the senior interagency group, first established by former President George H.W.
