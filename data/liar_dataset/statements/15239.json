When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%,&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/983284198046826496\">tweeted</a> April 9. &quot;Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - &nbsp;going on for years!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s figures match up with international trade data. But economists raised some important details that Trump omitted from his tweet, which put his claim in a slightly different light.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump&rsquo;s numbers are correct</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s numbers are drawn from <a href=\"https://hts.usitc.gov/?query=8703\">American</a> and <a href=\"http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/302427/302442/jckszcx/index.html\">Chinese</a> government trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States does, in fact, pay a 25 percent tariff on cars sent to China, whereas China pays only 2.5 percent on cars coming into the United States</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the numerical portion of Trump&rsquo;s claim is correct. But experts said his statement leaves out context.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">China makes up a relatively small share of U.S. auto imports</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, China exports very few cars to the United States. China accounted for about 3 out of every 10,000 cars sold in the United States last year, according to Michael Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For every car we import from China, we export six to China. None of those Chinese-produced cars is branded by a Chinese company (it is mostly Volvo),&quot; Hicks said. &quot;Our auto industry is doing extraordinarily well in China, while Chinese car production limps along.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To illustrate <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/c5700.html\">China</a>&rsquo;s relatively low share of car exports to the United States, Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, pointed out data on U.S. imports from <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/c2010.html\">Mexico</a> and <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/c1220.html\">Canada</a>. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States, Mexico and Canada impose no tariffs. Here&rsquo;s a side-by-side look at China, and the United States&rsquo; NAFTA trade partners:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;China exports very few cars to the U.S. So Trump&rsquo;s Tweet is once again a bit of a red herring,&quot; said Bown, who noted that a similar disparity exists when comparing Chinese car exports to the European Union, Japan or South Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Cherry-picking?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Some experts suggested Trump had cherry-picked the facts by singling out &quot;cars&quot; instead of a broader category of automobiles or car parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, the U.S. tariff on light trucks from China is 25 percent. That import duty is a legacy tariff that dates back to a trade dispute in the 1960s between the United States and several European countries, according to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So by choosing &lsquo;cars&quot; but not &lsquo;trucks&rsquo; in his Twitter example, Trump is cherry-picking products and not telling the entire story,&quot; said Bown, of the Peterson Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute, noted that Chinese tariffs on American auto parts sent to China are well below 25 percent. For example, China places a 10 percent tariff on automobile engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s significant because &quot;U.S. firms often ship auto parts to China to be assembled there,&quot; Hufbauer added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hicks, of Ball State University, noted that the trade disparity stems in part from Trump&rsquo;s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era deal to lower trade barriers among a dozen countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, had he not killed the TPP, whatever tariff distortions which now exist would have been reduced,&quot; Hicks said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://hts.usitc.gov/?query=8703\">American</a> and <a href=\"http://www.customs.gov.cn/customs/302427/302442/jckszcx/index.html\">Chinese</a> government trade data support the numbers in Trump&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Trump&rsquo;s tweet ignored that China makes up a relatively small share of U.S. auto imports overall, and he didn&rsquo;t tell the whole story by singling out cars rather than a broader category of related imports. One expert said Trump&rsquo;s own trade policies have contributed to the disparity in car import tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-09T15:58:40.796748", "ruling_date": "2018-04-09T17:06:15", "ruling_headline": "Is Donald Trump right that China slaps a 25 percent tariff on American cars?", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-right-china-slaps-25-percent-tariff-a", "ruling_link_text": "Driving home the point", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/983284198046826496\">Tweet</a> by President Donald Trump, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://hts.usitc.gov/?query=8703\">Data</a> from U.S. International Trade Commission, accessed April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Lucy Lu, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%.
