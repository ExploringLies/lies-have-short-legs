The two organizations, though, work closely together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USAID</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USAID has been providing protective equipment to partners in Africa since March, Herrick said. That includes Hazmat suits like the <a href=\"http://www.lakeland.com/europe/our-products/chemical-protective-clothing/chemmax-1.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>ChemMax 1 suit</u></a> referred to in Lakeland&rsquo;s press release. The suit, while not Ebola-exclusive, is designed to protect against infectious agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the suits, USAID&rsquo;s assistance to African organizations has come in the form of disease-control experts, funding and a variety of emergency supplies.

The 160,000 suits aren&rsquo;t actually &quot;far higher than what would be required merely for sending medical workers abroad,&quot; as InfoWars claimed. USAID has provided almost that many suits already, and there seems to be an immediate need for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This information is also public via USAID&rsquo;s press releases, so it&#39;s not as though they&rsquo;re privately predicting a &quot;rapid spread&quot; of Ebola beyond the scope of the current outbreak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website InfoWars claimed that the State Department &quot;has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola,&quot; demonstrating that &quot;the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread of a virus that has already claimed an unprecedented number of lives.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government agency in question is USAID, but that&rsquo;s something of a technicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp;USAID official told us that the suits are one use only, so 160,000 suits aren&rsquo;t actually an astronomical amount. In fact, USAID has already delivered 100,000 suits to the Ebola-infected regions of Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their new bid, while an expansion of their efforts, is in line with what USAID has done so far, and doesn&rsquo;t demonstrate that the federal government is anticipating any sort of &quot;rapid spread.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-18T16:06:43.282333", "ruling_date": "2014-09-19T11:00:00", "ruling_headline": "InfoWars: U.S. ordering 160,000 Hazmat suits, sign that Ebola is about to spread", "ruling_headline_slug": "infowars-us-ordering-16000-hazmat-suits-sign-ebola", "ruling_link_text": "Suits are one-time use, bound for Africa", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>InfoWars, <a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/u-s-state-department-orders-160000-ebola-hazmat-suits/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;U.S. State Department Orders 160,000 Ebola Hazmat Suits,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Matthew Herrick, press director and spokesperson for the U.S. Agency for International Development, Sept. 17-18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MarketWatch, <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/lakeland-industries-announces-global-availability-of-hazmat-suits-for-ebola-2014-09-12/print\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Lakeland Industries Announces Global Availability of Hazmat Suits for Ebola,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/18/us-health-ebola-toll-idUSKBN0HD1IJ20140918\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Death toll in West Africa Ebola epidemic reaches 2,630: WHO,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lakeland, <a href=\"http://www.lakeland.com/europe/our-products/chemical-protective-clothing/chemmax-1.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;ChemMax 1,&quot;</u></a> 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USAID, <a href=\"http://www.lakeland.com/europe/our-products/chemical-protective-clothing/chemmax-1.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;USAID Commits More than $12 Million in Assistance for West African Ebola Response,&quot;</u></a> Aug. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USAID, <a href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-25-2014-usaid-airlifts-medical-supplies-emergency-equipment-ebola-response\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;USAID Airlifts Medical Supplies, Emergency Equipment for Ebola Response,&quot;</u></a> Aug. 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USAID, <a href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-27-2014-usaid-announces-5-million-additional-assistance-west-africa-ebola\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;USAID Announces $5 Million in Additional Assistance for West Africa Ebola Response,&quot;</u></a> Aug.27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USAID, <a href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-9-2014-usaid-will-mobilize-100-additional-african-health-workers-ebola-outbreak\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;United States Will Help Mobilize 100 Additional African Health Workers for the Ebola Outbreak,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before It&rsquo;s News, <a href=\"http://beforeitsnews.com/health/2014/09/state-dept-orders-160000-ebola-hazmat-suits-what-do-they-know-that-we-dont-know-experts-ebola-could-kill-millions-go-airborne-2549556.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;US State Dept Orders 160,000 Ebola HAZMAT Suits -- What Do They Know That We Don&rsquo;t Know?&quot;</u></a> September 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AllGov, <a href=\"http://www.allgov.com/departments/independent-agencies/united-states-agency-for-international-development-usaid?agencyid=7290\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;United States Agency for International Development (USAID),&quot;</u></a> 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "", "false_count": 82, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 280, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 416, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The U.S. State Department has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola, prompting concerns that the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread&quot;
