That <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/17/news/companies/target-bathroom-transgender/\">part is accurate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the story veers into false territory by saying Target CEO Bryan Hornell claimed the chain &quot;will no longer cater to religious extremists&quot; by selling the Bible.
