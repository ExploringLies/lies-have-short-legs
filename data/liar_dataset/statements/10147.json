Jason Carter was adamant in 2011 that Gov. Nathan Deal was taking the wrong approach to saving HOPE, arguably the most popular state program ever created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lottery-funded scholarship program was looking at potential bankruptcy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deal, Georgia&rsquo;s newly elected governor, proposed a series of changes to the program &mdash; the most significant being that full scholarships would go only to the best and brightest, students with a 3.7 grade-point average and 1200 SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter, however, championed an alternative in 2011 and 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His proposal would have set a so-called income cap on HOPE scholarships. The scholarships would go only to qualifying students from families with a household income of $140,000 or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opponents said that would put the program in equal financial peril, eliminating only 6 percent of all Georgia families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed income caps resurfaced recently in the tight governor&rsquo;s race between Carter and Deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans pounced with attack ads suggesting Carter &quot;wants to eliminate HOPE scholarships for thousands of middle-class families.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then Carter appeared to change his approach on the income cap. At an education summit earlier this month, Carter said an income cap is &quot;probably too blunt an instrument.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal, he said, is to maximize the number of scholars and consider &quot;need without a full-fledged cap.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So has Carter flip-flopped on his position?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found an article from January indicating that Carter had changed from his original call for an income cap. He said he still wanted to push for some needs-based criteria for the HOPE scholarship. But he dismissed the idea of an income cap, calling it &quot;too blunt an instrument,&quot; the magazine reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas said Carter first discussed abandoning the idea of an income cap with students at the University of Georgia about a year ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, said Carter was late to the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s literally taken Jason Carter three and a half years to realize you &lsquo;cannot pay for everybody&rsquo; &mdash; a conclusion that responsible Republicans and Democrats reached when they took courageous votes to save HOPE from bankruptcy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Carter&rsquo;s change of heart on HOPE a Full Flop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-27T17:16:36.247670", "ruling_date": "2014-10-28T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Carter flips position on income cap for HOPE scholars", "ruling_headline_slug": "Carter", "ruling_link_text": "Lottery funds have been door opener", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;Jason Carter says caps on HOPE eligibilty are &lsquo;too <a href=\"http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/10/14/jason-carter-says-caps-on-hope-eligibilty-are-too-blunt-an-instrument/\">blunt</a> an instrument,&quot; The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Oct. 21, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;HOPE Scholarship: The Con,&quot; Atlanta <a href=\"http://www.atlantamagazine.com/colleges/hope-scholarship-cons/\">Magazine</a>, Jan. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governor Deal&#39;s session <a href=\"http://www.dealforgovernor.com/realagenda/sblog.php?b=13\">blog</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Senate Democrats <a href=\"http://gareport.com/story/2012/01/23/senate-democrats-propose-means-testing-for-hope-applicants/\">propose</a> means-testing for HOPE applicants,&quot; Georgia Report, by Tom Crawford, Jan. 23, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"entry-meta\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "State Senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jason", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2327, "last_name": "Carter", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "jason-carter", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jason_Carter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2327/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.senate.ga.gov/senators/en-US/member.aspx?Member=720&Session=23"}, "statement": "<p>On an income cap for recipients of the popular HOPE scholarship</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "forum", "statement_date": "2014-10-07", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
