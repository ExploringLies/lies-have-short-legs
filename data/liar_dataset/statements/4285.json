Democrats and Republicans began finger-pointing that was not limited to Washington.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine issued a statement blaming Obama for what he called a &quot;Democrat downgrade.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;President Obama and Democrats&#39; spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions, maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the Democrat Downgrade of our country&#39;s AAA credit rating,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has repeatedly checked statements in recent months about &quot;maxing out the U.S. credit card,&quot; and found significant exaggeration. Although Democrats shoulder a fair amount of blame for the nation&#39;s fiscal woes, so do Republicans because they voted for tax cuts and additional spending that also contributed to the large deficits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat is new in DeWine&#39;s statement is what attracted our attention: the label of &quot;Democrat downgrade&quot; on S&amp;P&#39;s rating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the Ohio GOP how it backed up the claim, and it cited about two dozen sources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne was a PolitiFact story that referred to Obama as &quot;the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents.&quot; (Which, the story went on to say, &quot;goes to show that statistics can be used -- and misused -- to bolster almost any argument.&quot;)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other sources, mostly commentaries, fault Obama&#39;s leadership on the economy, tie Democrats to spending or speculate on the political damage to Obama and Democrats from the downgrade. One citation is a story from Politico saying that Obama &quot;is now firmly part of the landscape that S&amp;P trashed&quot; -- after the story says he was &quot;dragged by Hill Republicans into the endless fiscal and personal nightmare that was the debt ceiling debate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think the best way to determine what&#39;s in the S&amp;P report is to read it. It&#39;s available to anyone online.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We lowered our long-term rating on the U.S.,&quot; the report says, &quot;because we believe that the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate indicate that further near-term progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on raising revenues is less likely than we previously assumed and will remain a contentious and fitful process.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words -- though S&amp;P says it &quot;takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures&quot; that would put the country&#39;s finances on more stable footing -- the firm looked for spending to be better contained and for revenues to increase. New revenues might have helped head off a downgrade, but &quot;the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues,&quot; the report says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tS&amp;P faults &quot;the political brinksmanship of recent months&quot; for making America&#39;s governance and policymaking &quot;less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe firm complains that the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default &quot;have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy&quot; and that &quot;the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn our reading -- and in the words of the very Politico story that the GOP cites as a source -- &quot;S&amp;P suggested that the Democrats are just as much a part of the problem as the Republicans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe repeat: Just as much. &nbsp;Democrats and Republicans both. That means the one-sided label of &quot;Democrat downgrade&quot; has some element of truth -- but it ignores so much critical information that it gets a Truth-O-Meter rating of Mostly False.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-12T16:26:18.535369", "ruling_date": "2011-08-12T18:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio GOP chairman Kevin DeWine blames Democrats for drop in credit rating", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-gop-chairman-kevin-dewine-blames-democrats-dr", "ruling_link_text": "Fingers point in both directions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tStandard &amp; Poor&#39;s, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DUS_Downgraded_AA%2B.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243942957443&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8\">Research Update: United States of America Long-Term Rating Lowered To &#39;AA+&#39; On Political Risks And Rising Debt Burden; Outlook Negative</a>,&quot; Aug. 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/06/business/us-debt-downgraded-by-sp.html?_r=2&amp;ref=todayspaper\">S.&amp; P.
