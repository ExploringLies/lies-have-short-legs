I said quickly (after the 9/11 attacks), &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.&rsquo; I believe to this day that was the right decision.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a Snopes <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/abc-news-bans-flag-lapel-pins/\">fact-check</a> from October 2001, ABC News was singled out because a nationally syndicated <a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-09-26/news/0109260113_1_flag-pins-ribbons-american-flag\">article</a> suggested the network&rsquo;s policy made it an outlier among news networks at a time of heightened patriotism. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus spawned the false claim about ABC News enacting a new policy banning lapel pins in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the <a href=\"http://politifeed.net/news/abc-news-joins-obama-to-ban-american-flag-lapel-pins-heres-what-you-need-to-know\">claim has been updated</a> to make it appear the ABC News&rsquo; &quot;ban&quot; (in truth, a longstanding policy) is a response to Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political conditions may have changed since the claim was first born, but it is still untrue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an aside, we&rsquo;d note that the older claim that President Barack Obama sought to ban American flag pins is an extreme distortion of <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/18/barack-obama/obama-contradicts-previously-stated-pin-philosophy/\">reality</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-25T14:25:07.179934", "ruling_date": "2018-07-25T14:43:47", "ruling_headline": "No, ABC News did not recently ban American flag pins on TV", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-abc-news-did-not-recently-ban-american-flag-pin", "ruling_link_text": "Pinning down the facts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Politifeed, &quot;<a href=\"http://politifeed.net/news/abc-news-joins-obama-to-ban-american-flag-lapel-pins-heres-what-you-need-to-know\">ABC News Joins Obama To Ban American Flag Lapel Pins, Here&rsquo;s What You Need To Know</a>,&quot; July 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/18/barack-obama/obama-contradicts-previously-stated-pin-philosophy/\">Obama contradicts previously stated pin philosophy</a>,&quot; April 18, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/abc-news-bans-flag-lapel-pins/\">Did ABC News Ban Flag Lapel Pins?</a>&quot; Oct. 8, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orlando Sentinel, &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-09-26/news/0109260113_1_flag-pins-ribbons-american-flag\">Flag Pins Spark Debate In TV News</a>,&quot; Sept. 26, 2001</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>ABC News recently banned reporters from wearing American flag lapel pins on air.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a blog", "statement_date": "2018-07-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
