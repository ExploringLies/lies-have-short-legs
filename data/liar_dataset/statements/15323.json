Hardaway makes up half the social media ensemble, along with her sister Rochelle Richardson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diamond and Silk stuck to their claim even after confronted with an FEC filing showing the campaign gave them $1,274.

Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, Hardaway said five times that the activists have never been paid by the Trump campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., reminded the sisters they were under oath and subject to perjury, before asking them about receiving money from Trump&rsquo;s campaign. He cited an <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00580100/1133930/sb/ALL/4\">FEC filing</a> showing the Trump campaign gave them $1,274 for &quot;field consulting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hLiknAunRE8Delkiaf1NLNj_LMEaPSYow-9aJdVmWKCe40PHbJ45zKWa3XslE3uQ1VtAaZ_KRHuYzFU6zAD-jjZI-O45NcmVZh_AKmyIkr5hC8mWf88anymJw8M1vvzc0T12TdbL\" style=\"border:none; height:103px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richardson explained the money was reimbursement for travel expenses the sisters incurred for airfare to a 2016 event called Women for Trump. The reference to &quot;field consulting,&quot; she said, may have been a mistake on the Trump campaign&rsquo;s part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bradley Crate, the treasurer for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., sent PolitiFact an email that corroborated the sisters&rsquo; claim about reimbursement:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;The issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign&rsquo;s reporting obligations. The Campaign&rsquo;s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group, said, &quot;The payment sounds like a reasonable reimbursement of travel costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he noted because the payment was not accompanied with receipts and was thus declared as payment for services by the Trump campaign, the activists &quot;are obligated to declare it as income and pay taxes on it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, reasonable people can disagree about whether reimbursement for travel expenses constitutes &quot;pay&quot; or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pro-Donald Trump activists Diamond and Silk said, &quot;We have never been paid by the Trump campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The social media ensemble received $1,274 from the Trump campaign.
