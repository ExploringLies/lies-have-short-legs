Two years prior, Missouri ranked 34 out of 50. In 2012, Missouri ranked 29 out of 50.

This means recognizing qualities like overall growth in the economy, the quality of the workforce, universities, capital investments and research and development inputs.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;If it doesn&rsquo;t meet Amazon&rsquo;s requirements, it might be a great choice for other companies that are looking to grow in high-tech,&quot; Ratnatunga said.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Missouri officials claimed Missouri ranked &quot;3rd (in) average yearly growth of high-tech industries.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>While Missouri high-tech industries may have seen growth, the size of base matters.
