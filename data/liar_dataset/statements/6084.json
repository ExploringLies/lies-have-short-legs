John Cornyn of Texas called June 12, 2012, for Attorney General Eric Holder&#39;s resignation, saying Holder is stonewalling about a botched investigation that involved moving guns across the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHolder disputed Cornyn&#39;s characterization of his responsiveness about Operation Fast and Furious, also pointing out he ended the gun-walking program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet Cornyn also aired another criticism, both at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and in a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/06/12/attorney-general-eric-holder-should-resign/#ixzz1xc5l1lFA\">commentary</a> placed the same day on the Fox News website. In the commentary, Cornyn said <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/about/meetattorney.html\">Ronald Machen</a>, one of two U.S. attorneys just named by Holder to lead the government&rsquo;s investigation of information leaks, &quot;has donated thousands of dollars to President Obama&rsquo;s political campaigns; he vetted vice presidential candidates for the Obama team in 2008; and he got his first job as a federal prosecutor from, you guessed it, Eric Holder. In short, Mr. Machen&rsquo;s inquiry will not seem truly independent. It is insulting for the attorney general to pretend otherwise.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if Machen, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, is indeed a former Obama campaign donor who vetted vice presidential hopefuls.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWho leaked information has been a hot topic in Washington since the New York Times published lengthy news articles on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">May 29, 2012</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\">June 1, 2012</a> detailing Obama&rsquo;s oversight of secret terrorist kill lists and his hand in planning cyber-attacks on Iran.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans including Cornyn have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to track down leakers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama has condemned any leaks as well, while Holder on June 8, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/June/12-ag-736.html\">announced</a> he was appointing Machen and <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/usao/md/USA/index.html\">Rod J. Rosenstein</a>, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, to lead criminal investigations into possible recent instances of unauthorized disclosures of classified information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMachen, a former assistant U.S. attorney, <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/about/meetattorney.html\">won Senate confirmation</a> in his post in February 2010. Rosenstein, initially appointed to his job by President George W. Bush, was retained by Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolder said: &quot;These two highly respected and experienced prosecutors will be directing separate investigations currently being conducted by the FBI. I have every confidence in their abilities to doggedly follow the facts and the evidence in the pursuit of justice wherever it leads.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cornyn challenged Machen&rsquo;s independence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter Holder confirmed that he had earlier hired Machen as an assistant U.S. attorney, Cornyn asked him: &quot;Would it surprise you to know that he is a political contributor to President Obama&rsquo;s campaign and indeed served as a volunteer in Obama for America and assisted in the vetting of potential vice presidential candidates?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolder replied: &quot;I am confident that he has the ability, the capacity to investigate this case in a nonpartisan, independent, thorough and aggressive way.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked for backup information, Cornyn spokeswoman Megan Mitchell later pointed us to<a href=\"http://bit.ly/KCfwak\"> research</a> by the Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign donations, indicating that Machen, identified on the center&rsquo;s site as a resident of Silver Spring, Md., and an attorney in the WilmerHale firm, donated a total of $4,100, in four chunks, to Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign from Feb. 8, 2008, through Sept. 30, 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn February 2010, the firm, whose full name is Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale &amp; Dorr, issued a <a href=\"http://www.wilmerhale.com/about/news/newsDetail.aspx?news=2023\">press release </a>&nbsp;identifying Machen as a partner. Machen joined the firm in 1993, then worked as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1997 to 2001 before returning to the firm, according to the release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitchell also pointed us to a Jan. 19, 2010, <a href=\"http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2010/01/machen-helped-with-vice-presidential-vetting.html\">news </a>blog post in Legal Times, which covers legal news in Washington and nationally. The post says Machen revealed on a Senate questionnaire he filled out fo as he faced confirmation that he had volunteered for Obama&rsquo;s campaign and vetted vice presidential prospects for Obama&rsquo;s campaign. The blog post says vetting work &quot;generally consists of standard background checks of personal information, public speeches, and writings.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe emailed Obama&rsquo;s campaign about Cornyn&#39;s claim. Spokeswoman Kara Carscaden declined to comment except to stress Holder&rsquo;s response to Cornyn about Machen&rsquo;s ability to perform his newly assigned task.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe are not judging here whether Machen&#39;s donations to Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign and his self-declared vetting of vice presidential prospects disqualify him from fully investigating any leaks. That said, Cornyn&rsquo;s statement rates True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-13T11:33:46.499046", "ruling_date": "2012-06-13T10:57:20", "ruling_headline": "John Cornyn says investigator of government leaks donated to and helped Obama's 2008 campaign", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-cornyn-says-obama-appointed-campaign-donor-wh", "ruling_link_text": "Holder stands by his man", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJohn Cornyn, commentary, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/06/12/attorney-general-eric-holder-should-resign/#ixzz1xc5l1lFA\">&quot;Attorney General Eric Holder should resign,&quot;</a> Fox News website, June 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://bit.ly/KCfwak\">Donations, 2008,</a> Ronald Machen of Maryland, Open Secrets website, Center for Responsive Politics, Washington (search conducted June 12, 2012)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail, response to PolitiFact Texas, Kara Carscaden, deputy national press secretary, Barack Obama campaign, June 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNews article, <a href=\"http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2010/01/machen-helped-with-vice-presidential-vetting.html\">&quot;U.S. Attorney Nominee Machen Helped With VP Vetting,&quot;</a> Legal Times, January 19, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 252, "last_name": "Cornyn", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-cornyn", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Cornyn.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/252/", "total_count": 31, "true_count": 9, "website": "http://www.johncornyn.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays lawyer appointed by Eric Holder to investigate government leaks helped and donated to Obama&#39;s campaign, vetting vice presidential prospects.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a commentary posted on the Fox News website.", "statement_date": "2012-06-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Eric", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 1620, "last_name": "Holder", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "eric-holder", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/eric_holder.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Rhode Island", "edition": "Rhode Island", "edition_slug": "rhode-island", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 6, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Rhode Island Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/6/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1620/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.justice.gov/"}, {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
