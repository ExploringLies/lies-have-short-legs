It contradicts, however, what President Donald Trump said about Donnelly, whom he dubbed &quot;Sleepin&rsquo; Joe&quot; during a May 11 campaign rally for Republican challenger Mike Braun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Center for Effective Lawmaking named Joe Donnelly the least effective Democrat lawmaker in the United States Senate,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He&#39;s never sponsored a bill that has become a law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So who&rsquo;s right? In a way, both are correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center for Effective Lawmaking, a nonpartisan research project run by two political science professors, assigns credit based on who is the sponsor of a bill, as recorded by the Library of Congress. Based on that definition, Donnelly has never sponsored a bill that became a law during his first term in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean none of his legislative proposals in the Senate have become law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craig Volden, who co-directs the center, noted that the criteria for advancing a legislative proposal could be broadened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A closer search of the Library of Congress database shows 28 bills that became law on which Donnelly was among the co-sponsors. He was an original co-sponsor, a higher bar, on five of these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Language from Donnelly&rsquo;s bills, and from amendments he proposed, have also made their way into law, mostly through annual budget acts. In all, these add up to 43 total and 17 under Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Donnelly <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/810?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22jacob+sexton%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1\">introduced a bill </a>in 2013 to improve suicide prevention efforts in the military. The bill didn&rsquo;t get far on its own, but Donnelly got the proposal passed in the National Defense Authorization Act in 2014 as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, Donnelly helped author Right to Try, a bill aimed at getting drugs that had not been FDA-approved to terminally ill patients. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., was the sponsor of the bill, so Donnelly didn&rsquo;t get that credit on Congress.gov &mdash; but Johnson gave it to him at a <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/24/trump-sign-big-legislation-donnelly-helped-craft/638331002/\">press conference</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My primary co-sponsor, Sen. Donnelly, was a stalwart,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;This would not have happened without Joe Donnelly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volden said that while valid measures of effectiveness, &quot;there is no similar comprehensive measure of the other senators in this regard that would allow a systematic comparison and ranking of senators on these criteria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts told us being in the minority in a divided Congress makes it harder for Donnelly to have gotten much passed anyway. Donnelly took office in 2013, and Democrats held the majority until 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you can see, passing the version he sponsors would let him claim credit easily &mdash; incorporating it elsewhere would not,&quot; said Corrine McConnaughy, political science professor at George Washington University. &quot;Partisans busy undermining each other absolutely may seek ways to prevent credit-claiming by the other party&#39;s members.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Donnelly has demonstrated willingness to cross the aisle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lugar Center&#39;s Bipartisan Index (named for former Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.)&nbsp;measures the frequency with which a member gets co-sponsors for their bills from the other party and the frequency with which they co-sponsor bills introduced by the other party. They <a href=\"http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html\">ranked</a> Donnelly fourth among senators and first among Democratic senators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Donnelly&rsquo;s campaign said, &quot;43 of Joe&rsquo;s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of those were the bills he sponsored on his own that became law. But in a gridlocked Congress, that&rsquo;s not unusual for a senator in the minority. Instead, Donnelly co-sponsored bills, wrote amendments and crafted language that made its way into 43 laws during his single Senate term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-10T14:35:52.385915", "ruling_date": "2018-08-13T09:41:34", "ruling_headline": "The facts behind Joe Donnelly's Senate effectiveness", "ruling_headline_slug": "facts-behind-joe-donnellys-senate-effectiveness", "ruling_link_text": "A medley of measures", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Will Baskin-Gerwitz, spokesman for Donnelly campaign, Aug. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sarah Binder, political science professor at George Washington University, Aug. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Corrine McConnaughy, political science professor at George Washington University, Aug. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Craig Volden, public policy and politics professor at the University of Virginia and co-director of the Center for Effective Lawmaking, Aug. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gerald Wright, political science professor at Indiana University, Aug. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Dan Diller, policy director at the Lugar Center, Aug. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lugar Center, <a href=\"http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html\">Bipartisan Index</a>, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress.gov, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/joe-donnelly/D000607\">Joe Donnelly</a>, accessed Aug. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indy Star, <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/21/truth-sen-joe-donnellys-legislative-effectiveness-and-donald-trumps-attacks-against-him/624798002/\">Here&#39;s the truth about Sen.
