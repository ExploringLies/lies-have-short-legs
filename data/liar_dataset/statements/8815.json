That provision requires that employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage to those putting in at least 30 hours a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Seventy-seven percent of Georgia&#39;s fire departments are volunteer, and it is unfair and unfortunate that those firefighters and the communities they protect are the latest Obamacare victims,&quot; </em>Brook Hougesen, the committee&rsquo;s press secretary, said in the statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the NRSC had accurately sounded the alarm on yet another problem with the Obamacare rollout. Or was the claim all wet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we started checking into the statement, it became apparent that people from the local firehouse to the halls of Congress were concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joe O&rsquo;Conor, Peachtree City&rsquo;s fire chief, said his city&rsquo;s full-time employees have an excellent benefits package that could not be replicated for its volunteer firefighters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our annual budget could not possibly allow us to extend comparable health care benefits to part-time and volunteer firefighters,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peachtree City Fire and Rescue runs with a blend of full-time, part-time and volunteer firefighters and EMT/paramedics. The volunteers receive a nominal stipend so they don&rsquo;t have to pull from the family budget to cover costs such as gas, child care or food while they are at the fire station, O&rsquo;Conor said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s much the same across Georgia, where 77 percent to 78 percent of firefighters are volunteers, said Glenn Allen, a spokesman for state Insurance and Fire Safety Commissioner Ralph T. Hudgens. In addition to small stipends, some local governments have workers&rsquo; compensation coverage for volunteer firefighters in case of injury at a fire scene or when the firefighters are in transit. But none is paid a salary. &quot;That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called volunteers,&quot; Allen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRSC statement warned that Obamacare requirements, if forced upon volunteer fire departments, could, among other things, &quot;result in higher taxes on Georgia families or penalties for the departments, many of which are already struggling financially.&quot; The committee cites an Associated Press report that says volunteer firefighters could be affected by the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Obamacare has been a disaster, and now volunteer firefighers and the communities that rely on them are the latest victims of this terrible law,&quot; Hougesen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The committee, which brags that it is &quot;the only national organization solely devoted to electing Republicans to the U.S. Senate,&quot; also took a swipe in its statement at Michelle Nunn, the best-known Democrat in Georgia&rsquo;s U.S. Senate race. The NRSC accused her of being &quot;adamantly loyal&quot; to the new health care law and &quot;prioritizing politics ahead of Georgia&rsquo;s first responders.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a day after the NRSC released its statement, Mark Mazur, the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s assistant secretary for tax policy, appeared to put the matter to rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wrote in a blog that the final regulations under Obamacare are going to include an exemption for volunteer emergency workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mazur&rsquo;s blog seemed to ease minds in the fire services community. William Metcalf, president and chairman of the board of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, put out a statement, calling it &nbsp;&quot;an important victory for America&#39;s fire and emergency services.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRSC&rsquo;s Hougesen defended the committee&rsquo;s press release, saying it came out &quot;a full day before Treasury announced its rule on the exemption for volunteer workers such as firemen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So when we said what we said, volunteer firefighters were still in danger,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But were they really in danger?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of Congress had already gone to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service last year, advocating for an exemption for volunteer firefighters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., also introduced legislation that would write an exemption for firefighters into law. His bill had 90 co-sponsors and bipartisan support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ruling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that volunteer firefighters and communities they serve in Georgia and elsewhere could be devastated by Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But fixes to the problem were already under way. Those regulatory fixes, which are set to be put in place by 2015, seem to satisfy the volunteer firefighters in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At minimum, it was premature for the National Republican Senatorial Committee to declare that firefighters and the communities they protect are &quot;the latest Obamacare victims.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the NRC&#39;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-24T16:28:25.090169", "ruling_date": "2014-01-27T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "ObamaCare fears spill over into public safety arena", "ruling_headline_slug": "obamacare-fears-spill-over-public-safety-arena", "ruling_link_text": "No 4-alarm here", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, &quot;Nunn Puts ObamaCare Above All: Volunteer Firefighters Latest Victim,&quot; Jan. 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview and email follow-ups with Glenn Allen, spokesman, Georgia Department of Insurance, Jan. 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview via email with Joe O&rsquo;Conor, fire chief, Peachtree City Fire &amp; Rescue, Jan. 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Fire Administration <a href=\"http://www.apps.usfa.fema.gov\">Website</a>,<a href=\"http://e.nrsc.org/t/j-l-ilqjit-diidlimr-a/\"> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview via email with Brook Hougesen, press secretary, National Republican Senatorial Committee, Jan. 14</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Michelle Nunn, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-nunn-grab-seat-georgia\">interview </a>on MSNBC, Oct. 14,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political Insider Oct. 24, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/oct/24/michelle-nunn-calls-delay-obamacare-mandate/\">Michelle Nunn calls for delay of Obamacare mandate, </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>H.R. 3685: <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3685/text\">Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act,</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 143, "last_name": "National Republican Senatorial Committee", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "national-republican-senatorial-committee", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Logo_NRC_Elephant_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/143/", "total_count": 35, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p><strong>Volunteer firefighters and communities they serve in Georgia and elsewhere are being devastated by Obamacare. </strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "press release", "statement_date": "2014-01-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
