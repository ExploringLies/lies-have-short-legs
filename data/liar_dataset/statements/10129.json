He has had no &#39;role&#39; in the campaign. Prior to Mayor Fung&#39;s announcement, Governor Carcieri was a member of the exploratory committee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also contacted Carcieri directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Both my wife and I have contributed to Allan and support him, but that&#39;s the whole extent. I have not campaigned with him,&quot; the former governor said. &quot;I know what campaigning is. I did enough of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carcieri said he went to the event to see Romney &quot;because Mitt and I go back to when we first came into office together, and we worked very closely together as New England governors. I was a big supporter for both of his runs for the presidency, and I hadn&#39;t seen him or talked to him in a while, so it was an opportunity to catch up and visit a little bit, which we did.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the Raimondo campaign if they had any better evidence that, for example, Carcieri addressed the crowd at the fundraising event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spokeswoman Nicole Kayner produced a photo taken outside the Providence Biltmore of Carcieri going in, and cited <a href=\"http://www.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/content/20141016-romney-on-stump-for-r.i.-governor-candidate-fung-takes-time-to-blast-cdc-over-ebola.ece\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a report in The Providence Journal</u></a> that said: &quot;Through the closed doors of the ballroom, cheers followed mention of both Fung&rsquo;s name and that of the state&rsquo;s last Republican governor, Donald Carcieri.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s pretty weak evidence for a loaded claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, we could find no convincing evidence that former Gov.
