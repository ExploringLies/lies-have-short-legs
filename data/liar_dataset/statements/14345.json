John Faso, R-Kinderhook, says Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo could do a better job managing the state&rsquo;s Medicaid program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has proposed legislation to shift Medicaid costs from counties to the state. Counties outside New York City pay close to $2.3 billion in Medicaid costs annually. Faso says the state could handle the expense if Cuomo cut costs elsewhere or lowered Medicaid spending, which topped $28 billion last year according to the <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/federalstate-share-of-spending/?dataView=1&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, a health policy analysis group.
