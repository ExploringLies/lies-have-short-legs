Rather, the articles included a fake quote in which the rapper allegedly said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin&rsquo; that someone would do what I did but with a real gun.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the Secret Service what Snoop said, landing Snoop in jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, Snoop is not a Trump fan &mdash; he called the president a &quot;clown&quot; in a <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7718241/snoop-dogg-lavender-video-donald-trump-clowns-director-jesse-wellens\">Billboard interview</a> &mdash; and the video for &quot;Lavender&quot;<em>&nbsp;</em>does not paint a flattering picture of the current chief executive.

They posted the story on March 14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site doesn&rsquo;t identify the Obama story as fake, but its <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/about-us/\">About Us</a> page notes that &quot;all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of the other websites flagged by Facebook indicate the story is contrived, either. But the post has been shared tens of thousands of times via various websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, who <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/23/politics/donald-trump-shoot-somebody-support/\">boasted as a presidential candidate</a>, &quot;I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn&#39;t lose voters,&quot; tweeted to decry the content of the video:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Like all presidents, Obama did face death threats, although it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/mar/18/julian-bond/no-concrete-evidence-support-claim/\">tough to say just how many</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least one other official also decried the imagery of the president with a gun to his head. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2017/03/13/marco-rubio-snoop-dogg-music-video-donald-trump/\">told TMZ.com</a> on March 13 that &quot;Snoop shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is really something people should be very careful about,&quot; Rubio said, adding that if the &quot;wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you could have a real problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Secret Service did <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/snoop-dogg-video-featuring-mock-trump-execution-is-on-the-secret-services-radar/\">tell TheWrap.com</a> on March 14 that they were &quot;aware&quot; of Snoop&rsquo;s video. But it doesn&rsquo;t appear they&rsquo;re hauling him off to prison over his comments. It is a <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap41-sec871.htm\">federal crime to threaten the president</a>, but such actions have to be substantial and credible enough to meet the level of a &quot;<a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2084921,00.html\">true threat</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The First Amendment <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-first-amendment-applies-to-trumps-presidency\">allows a lot of leeway for criticism</a>, and Snoop Dogg is hardly the only recording artist&nbsp;to signal his distaste for Trump. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, for example, released a video teaser in November 2016 for his new album <em>Say10</em>, in which he <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/08/marilyn-manson-s-shocking-trump-video.html\">beheads a man dressed suspiciously similar</a> to Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snoop Dogg&rsquo;s reaction since has been limited to a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRrRyDHjEkK/?taken-by=snoopdogg\">March 15 Instagram video</a> in which he said he&rsquo;s &quot;got nothing to say, mate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>He hasn&rsquo;t been arrested for his video or for talking about it, despite what the fake reports say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this one Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-23T14:54:43.538504", "ruling_date": "2017-03-23T15:30:27", "ruling_headline": "Snoop Dogg wasn\u2019t arrested over comments about shooting Donald Trump in music video", "ruling_headline_slug": "snoop-dogg-wasnt-arrested-over-comments-about-shoo", "ruling_link_text": "Drop it like it's hot, because this one's fake", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>USADailyTime.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://usadailytime.com/justin-snoop-arrested/\">Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His &lsquo;Murder Trump&rsquo; Video</a>,&quot; March 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-snoop-dogg-arrested-for-conspiracy-after-talking-about-his-murder-trump-video/\">BREAKING: Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His &lsquo;Murder Trump&rsquo; Video</a>,&quot; March 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/mar/18/julian-bond/no-concrete-evidence-support-claim/\">No evidence to support claim about threats against Obama</a>,&quot; March 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/23/politics/donald-trump-shoot-somebody-support/\">Trump: I could &#39;shoot somebody and I wouldn&#39;t lose voters&#39;</a>,&quot; Jan. 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheDailyBeast.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/08/marilyn-manson-s-shocking-trump-video.html\">Marilyn Manson&rsquo;s Shocking Trump Video</a>,&quot; Nov. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/E4i3bAtEuJE\">Lavender (Nightfall Remix)</a>,&quot; March 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TMZ.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2017/03/13/marco-rubio-snoop-dogg-music-video-donald-trump/\">Snoop Put Out A Dangerous Message With Mock Assassination</a>,&quot; March 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheWrap.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/snoop-dogg-video-featuring-mock-trump-execution-is-on-the-secret-services-radar/\">Secret Service Has Its Eye on Snoop Dogg Over Video Featuring Mock Trump Shooting</a>,&quot; March 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snoop Dogg, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRrRyDHjEkK/\">Instagram video</a>, March 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/841967881516679168\">President Donald Trump tweet</a>, March 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New Yorker</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-first-amendment-applies-to-trumps-presidency\">How the First Amendment applies to Trump&rsquo;s presidency</a>,&quot; March 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Government Publishing Office, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap41-sec871.htm\">&sect;871.
