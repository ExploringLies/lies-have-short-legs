While the poll was conducted online, participants were found through address-based sampling to include people who do not have internet access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question about the country&rsquo;s direction is asked first on the AP poll. This means previous questions don&rsquo;t influence the response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the Americans polled in February, 68 percent said things in this country are generally heading in the wrong direction. That&rsquo;s just under Ryan&rsquo;s 70 percent figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number was actually down from 74 percent in the previous poll, taken in December 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for some time people have thought the country is headed in the wrong direction. For the last two years, 60 percent or more of those polled by AP-GfK have said the country is heading in the wrong direction. Here&rsquo;s a look at those numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Date of poll</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Wrong direction percentage</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Feb. 11-15, 2016</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>68</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Dec. 3-7, 2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>74</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Oct. 15-19, 2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>63</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>July 9-13, 2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>64</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>April 23-27, 2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>62</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Jan. 29 - Feb. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>60</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Dec. 4-8, 2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>66</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>July 24-28, 2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>72</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>May 16-19, 2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>62</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, the bleak outlook from respondents for the country doesn&rsquo;t seem to affect the outlook for their own families. In the same poll, 76 percent of respondents said things for their family were generally headed in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Ryan&rsquo;s staff cited a single poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right direction-wrong direction is a common one in polling, so for comparison we took a look at Huffington Post Pollster.

The data shows that percentage has been hovering around 64 percent since October of 2015 and hasn&rsquo;t risen above 65 percent since 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By this measure, the only time 70 percent of Americans said the country was on the wrong track was in October 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ynkm4eqVrMqSQP29h8SjCw52pqsZhDcanXY4xCcl5osSgYEXD_nt1xymsPgTD-YC6OuCMnitbZ0K-jGkY5usuUOMX9Il9nced1b3cT_0qZ_pZuUmBREV-NfvIv3ftld-3rM0TJ0o\" style=\"border:none; height:477px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan said &quot;70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His team backed up this statement with reliable poll results from the Associated Press.
