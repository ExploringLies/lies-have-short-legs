Facebook brought the post to our attention as potentially being fake as part of its efforts to eliminate false stories from its news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story &mdash; which again, didn&rsquo;t happen &mdash; recounts the fate of the hapless crew of the whaler MV Nisshin Maru, many of whom abandoned ship after a gas leak forced them to clear the deck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ship was supposedly stranded in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, off the coast of South Africa. In a twist of irony too dark to be true (because it isn&rsquo;t), 16 whalers were swallowed by killer whales within a half hour of hitting the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yarn cast a wide net, <a href=\"http://www.disclose.tv/news/japanese_whaling_crew_eaten_alive_by_killer_whales_16_dead/131727\">landing on</a> <a href=\"http://newzmagazine.com/2016/06/06/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-killer-whales-16-dead/\">several websites</a>, with one version of the article <a href=\"http://www.socialeverythings.com/2017/02/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by.html?m=1\">posted as late as Feb. 12</a>. But we didn&rsquo;t take the bait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origin of this fish tale (yes, we know killer whales are mammals) goes all the way back to July 28, 2014. That&rsquo;s when WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting contrived stories, <a href=\"http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by-killer-whales-16-dead/\">first published the</a> <a href=\"http://archive.is/tNZHh\">saga of the Nisshin Maru</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story was pretty popular back then, too, because <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/weird-news/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by-killer-whales-16-dead-story-definitely-a-hoax-9639959.html\">several media outlets</a> <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-killer-whales-story-093659743.html\">wrote articles</a> <a href=\"http://antiviral.gawker.com/sorry-a-bunch-of-whalers-didnt-get-eaten-by-killer-wha-1614161532\">to point out</a> it was a made-up story. Nearly all of them made reference to the <a href=\"http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/disclaimer_/\">site&rsquo;s disclaimer</a>, which reads, &quot;All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no indication on the various posts we found identifying the story is fake. There&rsquo;s also no mention that it is several years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve noticed here at PolitiFact that some fake news stories seem to come back into the social media consciousness after a couple of years in limbo. We don&rsquo;t know why this one returned to port after so long adrift, but the story is still anchored in fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8ce44b69-3cfe-4eff-9f9f-0781ee391e09\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8ce44b69-3cfe-4eff-9f9f-0781ee391e09</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-22T13:30:36.684720", "ruling_date": "2017-02-23T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tale of killer whales eating Japanese whalers is fake news", "ruling_headline_slug": "tale-killer-whales-eating-japanese-whalers-fake-ne", "ruling_link_text": "Readers should throw this one back", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ReligionMind.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.religionmind.com/2017/02/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by.html\">Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead</a>,&quot; Feb. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WorldNewsDailyreport.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by-killer-whales-16-dead/\">Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead</a>,&quot; July 28, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2017-02-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
