Then he went further, saying it would be &quot;eliminated&quot; in 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is significance to the 10-year mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GOP proposal would, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office noted, gradually convert the current Medicare program to a system under which beneficiaries received premium support payments that can be used to help pay for a private health insurance policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeginning in 2022, &quot;all newly-eligible Medicare beneficiaries...would only have access to health coverage through private insurance plans, rather than through the current government-run Medicare program (i.e., traditional Medicare), or under a Medicare Advantage plan,&quot; a <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/8179.pdf\">Kaiser Family Foundation study </a>noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a fundamental switch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedicare would &quot;no longer provide coverage for medical care, but instead provide a &quot;subsidy&quot; toward the purchase of a private health insurance plan,&quot; the Kaiser study said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-Ryan_Letter.pdf\">CBO </a><a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-Ryan_Letter.pdf\">found </a>that the change would save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for current levels of coverage, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/20/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-republicans-voted-end-medicare-and-c/\">PolitiFact has reported </a>from the CBO report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s important to note, the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe vice president&rsquo;s office gave us its view on Biden&rsquo;s remarks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedicare is a &quot;system of guaranteed affordable health insurance for seniors. Preserving Medicare in its current form is a core Democratic value,&quot; the office said in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you replace the current system with vouchers, or premium support payments, then you are eliminating the principle of guaranteed affordable insurance and thus eliminating Medicare as we know it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose last four words are very important -- and were missing from the original statement, the one that got the attention and that we are rating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBiden says Ryan&rsquo;s plan &quot;eliminates Medicare&quot; in 10 years. In stating it that way in front of campaign donors, he strays from the &quot;as we know it&quot; qualifier even the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/13/remarks-president-fiscal-policy\">president has used.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bottom line is that all seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program&rsquo;s budget would increase every year. The plan would reduce the growth in Medicare spending but not wipe out that spending. And current beneficiaries and those currently 55 and over would not be affected by the changes. It changes Medicare, dramatically, but does not eliminate it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Biden&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-02T18:20:35.111118", "ruling_date": "2011-09-07T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Vice President Joe Biden says Rep.
