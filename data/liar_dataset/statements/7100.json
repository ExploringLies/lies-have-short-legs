During the campaign to persuade voters to mark &quot;yes&quot; on their ballots, the Library Yes! Committee made a number of arguments in the district&rsquo;s favor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the most ubiquitous was the oft-repeated fact that the Multnomah County Library was the &quot;second busiest in the nation.&quot; Given that Portland doesn&rsquo;t even crack the 25 largest cities in the nation (by population), this fact has always struck us as pretty interesting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the campaign season, we were a bit distracted with various other claims, but now that things are bit quieter, we thought we&rsquo;d come back to this one -- if only for curiosity&rsquo;s sake.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe e-mailed Liz Kaufman, who handled media requests for the library district campaign, and she quickly followed up with a handy breakdown of statistics about the Multnomah County Library and its peer institutions, compiled by the American Library Association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe association doesn&rsquo;t track how &quot;busy&quot; a system is per se, but it does check the circulation -- or the total number of items issued in a given year. By that measure, the Multnomah County system is, indeed, the second busiest with 23,946,498.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe followed up with a phone call to the association for good measure and spoke with Macey Morales, their media point-person. She cautioned that their figures came from the Public Library Associations&rsquo; survey. &quot;A total of 1,300 libraries from the U.S. and Canada voluntarily complete the survey, so the report reflects a sample of public libraries in North America,&quot; she wrote in a follow-up e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, the Multnomah County system does have the second highest circulation in the most recent survey. The New York Public Library comes in first -- although to be fair, that system has some 87 branches compared to Multnomah&rsquo;s 18. A quick aside: We also have the second highest circulation per capita. In that category, we were edged out -- 33 to 34 per person a year -- by Ohio&rsquo;s Cuyahoga County Public Library.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorales did point us to one other source, the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The institute does a more complete library census, looking at some 9,000 systems. The catch there is that their figures take a while to get published. They&rsquo;re currently waiting on 2010 figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA report released by the institute in December 2009, said Multnomah County Library boasted the third highest circulation rate in the country -- there&rsquo;s no mention of who is first or second. Those figures, of course, would be somewhat dated compared to the other survey -- though potentially more complete.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s often said that the Multnomah County Library system is the nation&rsquo;s second busiest. The most recent available statistics from a survey used widely in the industry backs up the claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-16T16:50:13.861203", "ruling_date": "2012-11-16T13:49:46", "ruling_headline": "Is the Multnomah County Library system the second busiest in the nation?", "ruling_headline_slug": "mulnomah-county-library-system-second-busiest-nati", "ruling_link_text": "Most recent numbers say \"yes.\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail from Libraries Yes!
