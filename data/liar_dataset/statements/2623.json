John Boccieri, a Greek chorus of indignant senior citizens ties Republican congressional candidate Jim Renacci to the third rail of politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Mr. Renacci. I&rsquo;d rather put my Social Security money in here, or in here, or in here, than let you privatize MY Social Security,&quot; a group of them scold, throwing cash into a hole in the ground, a coffee can, and a dresser drawer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I paid into Social Security for 40 years, it&rsquo;s all I have, and you want to gamble it away on Wall Street, Mr. Renacci?&quot; ask another pair of seniors, as the words &quot;Jim Renacci wants to privatize Social Security&quot; flash onto the screen, as if to answer their question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe thought we&#39;d run Renacci&#39;s position on privatizing Social Security through the Flip-O-Meter, in light of Boccieri&rsquo;s ad, to see if his position has been consistent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRenacci campaign manager Jim Slepian says the ad is false, and that Renacci does not want to privatize Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe points to a <a href=\"http://www.renacciforcongress.com/Issues/Social_Security_\" target=\"blank\">spot on Renacci&#39;s website</a> where the former Wadsworth mayor says the federal government must &quot;implement reforms to address the growing fiscal crisis that is facing the Social Security balance sheet.&quot; On his website, Renacci stipulates Washington must &quot;ensure that Social Security benefits are protected and that needed reforms are brought to bear that would not raise taxes or privatize the system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSlepian said that&#39;s still Renacci&#39;s position. &quot;He has said time and time again that we cannot and should not privatize the system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the Boccieri campaign what information they had that showed something different. Boccieri spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw pointed us to a <a href=\"http://votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=120678\" target=\"blank\">survey Renacci filled out</a>&nbsp; for &quot;<a href=\"http://votesmart.org/index.htm\" id=\"xhl8\" target=\"blank\" title=\"Project Vote Smart\">Project Vote Smart</a>.&quot; In that survey, Renacci said he favored of privatizing parts of the Social Security system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;To the extent that I support privatizing elements of Social Security, I support allowing workers to privately invest a portion of their payroll taxes,&quot; Renacci explained on the Vote Smart website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe do not think that Renacci is advocating measures that amount to turning the entire Social Security system over to Wall Street. But that&#39;s not been the case, either, for previous privatization proposals. In 2005, for example, President George W. Bush promoted moving toward a government-funded program that also allowed for personal accounts. Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has proposed a similar blend of programs as part of an overall budget plan he calls &quot;The Roadmap.&quot; His plan, too, is a far cry from a wholly privatized system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while Renacci&#39;s opposition to privatization is firm on his website, his answers to Project Vote Smart&#39;s survey suggest support for privatization as it has been proposed in the past.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tReconciling those two positions and landing on two feet requires a Full Flop.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/10/jim_renacci_has_come_down_on_b.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-18T17:41:05.772821", "ruling_date": "2010-10-19T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jim Renacci has come down on both sides of privatizing Social Security ", "ruling_headline_slug": "jim-renacci-has-come-down-both-sides-privatizing-s", "ruling_link_text": "Maybe yes, maybe no", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">John Boccieri for Congress, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_9BpK9rBBA\" id=\"f262\" title=\"Here\">Here</a>,&quot; posted to YouTube Oct. 5, 2010</font></font></font><br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\"><a href=\"http://votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=120678\" id=\"k5tm\" title=\"Project Vote Smart\">Project Vote Smart</a> </font></font></font><font color=\"#000099\"><font size=\"2\">survey</font></font><br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">Jim Renacci for Congress, <a href=\"http://www.renacciforcongress.com/Issues/Social_Security_\" id=\"hd.-\" title=\"Social Security issue page\">Social Security issue page</a>, accessed Oct. 18, 2010&nbsp; </font></font></font><br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">PolitiFact, &quot;</font></font></font><a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/sep/02/democratic-exaggerations-about-privatizing-social-/\" style=\"font-family: arial\"><font color=\"#000099\"><u><font size=\"2\">Democratic exaggerations about &quot;privatizing Social Security</font></u></font></a><font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">,&quot; Sept. 2, 2010</font></font></font><br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">Email with James Slepian, campaign manager for <font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">Jim Renacci</font></font></font>, Oct. 7, 2010</font></font></font><br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">Email with Jessica Kershaw, campaign spokeswoman for <font face=\"arial\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font size=\"2\">John Boccieri</font></font></font>, Oct. 7, 2010</font></font></font><br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"font-family: arial\" />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "U.S. representative ", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Jim", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 606, "last_name": "Renacci", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "jim-renacci", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-renacci_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/606/", "total_count": 19, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://jimrenacci.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tOn privatization of Social Security.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a statement posted to his website", "statement_date": "2010-10-18", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 141, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/141/", "subject": "Social Security", "subject_slug": "social-security", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
