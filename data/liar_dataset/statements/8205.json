Historically and culturally, Tennessee and West Virginia could just as easily be categorized as Appalachian. In fact, other federal agencies, including the <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/southeast/\"><u>Fish and Wildlife Service</u></a> and the <a href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-epa-region-4-southeast\"><u>Environmental Protection Agency</u></a>, do not count West Virginia as a southeastern state, and the Library of Congress&rsquo; <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/rrhtml/regdef.html\"><u>guide to American regions</u></a> doesn&rsquo;t include a &quot;southeastern&quot; region at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the fuzziness of the concept of &quot;southeastern,&quot; we are prepared to give Haley some leeway in determining a definition. Under one definition we find plausible -- former Confederate states that also have a coastline, which would exclude Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia -- Haley&rsquo;s claim would be correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One additional issue: When we check a claim in which the speaker either takes credit or casts blame on an elected official, we try to factor in whether that personal credit or blame is deserved. In this case, Haley wasn&rsquo;t explicitly saying that she was responsible for South Carolina&rsquo;s region-topping ranking, but it did come during an event in which she sought a second term, based in part on the state&rsquo;s economic health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Seyfried, a professor of economics at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., said that some of South Carolina&rsquo;s growth was due to the national manufacturing rebound in 2011 and 2012. &quot;Being a manufacturing-oriented state when manufacturing is growing helped,&quot; Seyfried said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Institute for Economic Competitiveness said that, in general, &quot;politicians receive more blame and credit for the economy than is often justifiable, and policy tools at the state level are of a much smaller caliber than those wielded at the national level.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Snaith said he thought Haley&rsquo;s statement was reasonably solid. Compared to other economic claims by politicians, he said, Haley&rsquo;s is &quot;one of the more straightforward.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley said South Carolina has &quot;the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast.&quot; Since she took office, South Carolina had the third-highest growth rate among the 12 states that constitute the broadest definition of &quot;southeastern.&quot; But in a geographically tighter group of eight states, South Carolina does rank first. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-29T12:36:50.104197", "ruling_date": "2013-08-30T09:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Nikki Haley says South Carolina has had fastest growth in the Southeast", "ruling_headline_slug": "nikki-haley-says-south-carolina-has-had-fastest-gr", "ruling_link_text": "It depends on how you define \"Southeast\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/08/26/south-carolina-gov-haley-launches-reelection-campaign-video/\"><u>South Carolina Gov.
