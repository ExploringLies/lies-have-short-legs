Robin Vos, the Republican from Rochester who was elected Nov. 13, 2012 as speaker of the state Assembly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVos made clear in a recent <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/1006/_1211008Vos.mp3\">WisPolitics interview </a>that his top priority is a middle-class income tax cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you&rsquo;re poor in Wisconsin, it is one of the best places in the country to be poor. We&rsquo;re in the bottom 10 states as far as paying taxes if you&rsquo;re poor,&quot; Vos said in the interview. &quot;If you&rsquo;re successful, we are in the middle. I think we&rsquo;re number 15 or 16 ...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But if you&rsquo;re a person in the middle class, somebody who makes $20,000 to $200,000, you&rsquo;re in the top 4 or 5 worst places in the country to be a middle-class income taxpayer.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVos went on to tell WisPolitics that Republicans want an across-the-board income-tax cut, though the &quot;primary benefits&quot; would go to the middle class. When we asked him to clarify what he meant, he told us fiscal constraints might preclude -- for now -- reducing income tax rates on upper-income earners for whom legislative Democrats and Gov. Jim Doyle raised the top rate in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, is Vos right about how the income tax burden affects low and middle-income earners?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked for backup, Vos pointed us to research presented to the bipartisan <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lc/committees/study/2012/INTAX/index.html\">Steering Committee on Income Tax</a>, a study group chaired by Vos that was set up through the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Lower-income workers:</strong> Vos said their income tax burden is in the bottom 10, and it&rsquo;s clear from the complete interview he meant among the 41 states that levy a personal income tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a November 2009 study, the nonpartisan, liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) <a href=\"http://www.itepnet.org/whopays3.pdf\">ranked the burden </a>on the lowest one-fifth of Wisconsin&rsquo;s earners as the 29th-lowest among those 41 states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not quite bottom 10, but the group&rsquo;s executive Matthew Gardner told us the difference between Wisconsin and the lowest rung of the bottom 10 was so &quot;trivially small&quot; as to be meaningless.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother 50-state study, by the <a href=\"http://www.mntax.org/cpfr/documents/Income_Tax_Burden_Study_TY2008_FINAL_000.pdf\">Minnesota Taxpayers Association </a>in 2011, ranked the low-income burden in Wisconsin as either 32nd- or 34th-lowest for married couples at $10,000 or $20,000. Both are bottom 10.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Wisconsin, as in several other states, the working poor often have a &quot;negative&quot; income tax bill -- they get tax credits that wipe out their tax liability and in some cases result in a payment to them from the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin would be lower in these rankings, but some states pay even larger credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Middle-income earners:</strong> Vos said this group faces a top-five burden.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIncome taxes paid by Wisconsin married couples and single heads of household in the $75,000 to $100,000 income range are fifth-highest in the country, based on the Minnesota study. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue indirectly cited the Minnesota study in testimony before the Vos-chaired study group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA sub-group of all married couples -- senior couples making $100,000 -- have the fourth-highest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Minnesota group&rsquo;s research director, Aaron Twait, said he considers the $100,000 mark for two earners a classic middle-class household, based on average incomes in Wisconsin and Minnesota.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, the ITEP study shows only four states collecting a higher average tax rate than Wisconsin in the $57,000-$88,000 range.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Vos has evidence to back up this part of his claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut when you look at other levels within Vos&rsquo;s middle-class range of $20,000 to $200,000, the burden is not quite as heavy as Vos said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, at the $150,000 level in the Minnesota study, the rankings are No. 10 for singles, No. 8 for married couples filing jointly and No. 9 for single heads of household. Again, that&rsquo;s among the 41 states with an income tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt $50,000, we found a mix of rankings between No. 3 and No. 7.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Vos mentioned one other income group, the &quot;successful,&quot; by which he meant upper-income. It&rsquo;s not part of the claim we&rsquo;re testing, but Vos said that group&rsquo;s income-tax burden was in the middle of the 41 states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s basically on target. We found tax-burden rankings from No. 11 to No. 17 for top earners in categories such as $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million annual income. These rankings were from the Minnesota study. The ITEP study also shows the rankings falling as income rises.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVos said that when it comes to income taxes, Wisconsin is &quot;one of the best places in the country to be poor&quot; but &quot;top 4 or 5 worst&quot; for middle-income earners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s mostly on target here, based on credible tax studies showing a very low burden on the working poor, compared to a very high burden on many middle-income earners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot all the middle-income earners face a top-5 tax burden, though: It&rsquo;s top-10 for some in the middle-class as he defined it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-13T16:52:36.015671", "ruling_date": "2012-11-14T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Vos says on income taxes, Wisconsin is one of easiest for the poor and hardest for the middle class", "ruling_headline_slug": "vos-says-income-taxes-wisconsin-one-easiest-poor-a", "ruling_link_text": "State leans heavily on middle class", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisPolitics.com, <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/1006/_1211008Vos.mp3\">audio </a>of interview with Rep.
