Tom Donelson of Americas PAC told the Journal Sentinel and us that the committee stands by the ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But two of the three deaths clearly don&rsquo;t support the attack on Baldwin:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/opiates-handed-out-like-candy-to-doped-up-veterans-at-wisconsin-va-b99423091z1-288223591.html\">Jacob Ward</a> had been heavily medicated at the Tomah VA and later became a drug addict.

Ward, who was 27, overdosed on heroin and cocaine in a Milwaukee apartment on Sept. 4, 2013. That was six years after he stopped going to Tomah and a year before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/2015/02/11/tomah-va-pressed-over-another-vets-death/23234485/?hootPostID=8505fa8981da6b57eeb373da21bfb3db\">Thomas Patrick Baer</a>, 74, died Jan. 14, 2015 at a hospital in La Crosse, Wis., two days after he suffered two strokes at the Tomah VA while waiting for treatment there. His death was not connected to overmedication.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/opiates-handed-out-like-candy-to-doped-up-veterans-at-wisconsin-va-b99423091z1-288223591.html\">Simcakoski</a>, who suffered a fatal drug overdose in the psychiatric ward of the Tomah VA. He had been prescribed 15 drugs, including muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, antipsychotic medicines and an opioid painkiller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a timeline of his case and how it relates to Baldwin, based primarily on Gannett Wisconsin Media news reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jason Simcakoski</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between April and June of 2014, Baldwin wrote letters to <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/4_7_14_Letter_to_Tomah_VAMC_Director_DeSanctis.pdf\">the Tomah VA director,</a> a <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/6_12_14_Letter_VA_Congressional_Liaison_Service_Director_Ronald_Maurer.pdf\">VA official</a> in Washington and the <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/6_25_14_Letter_to_Catherine_Gromek_VA_OIG.pdf\">VA inspector general</a> in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She asked each of them to investigate allegations that &quot;a large percentage of veterans&quot; at the Tomah VA were being treated for abuse of opioids and other drugs that had originally been prescribed by the facility -- and that continued to be prescribed to them. The allegations were made by a constituent who wanted to remain anonymous, according to the letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means Baldwin had taken those steps months before the Simcakoski&rsquo;s death, which occurred on Aug. 30, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Ryan Honl, the whistleblower alluded to in the radio ad, didn&rsquo;t make a complaint to Baldwin&rsquo;s office until nearly <a href=\"http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/investigations/2015/02/24/tomah-veterans-affairs-secrecy-missed-opportunities/23901367/\">a month later</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin nevertheless has been criticized because she <a href=\"http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/investigations/2015/02/24/tomah-veterans-affairs-secrecy-missed-opportunities/23901367/\">took no action</a> between Aug. 29, 2014 -- the day before Simcakoski&rsquo;s death, when <a href=\"http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/2015/01/19/sen-baldwin-had-tomah-va-report-for-months/22025759/\">her office received</a> an <a href=\"http://wisinfo.biz/ic/PDFs/2014VAreport.pdf\">inspection report</a> documenting the overprescribing of opioids at Tomah -- and January 2015, when the Center for Investigative Reporting revealed the circumstances of his death and Baldwin called for an investigation. In between, Honl had <a href=\"http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/investigations/2015/02/24/tomah-veterans-affairs-secrecy-missed-opportunities/23901367/\">repeatedly emailed </a>Baldwin&rsquo;s office asking that Baldwin call for an investigation and make the inspection report public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin later <a href=\"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/local/2015/03/13/baldwins-chief-staff-read-tomah-report-dismissed-opiate-concerns/70275704/\">said she was disciplining</a> her chief of staff and two other aides for failing to take appropriate action on complaints about Tomah. And she said her office made mistakes in handling the inspection report and the whistleblower&rsquo;s pleas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Baldwin didn&rsquo;t receive the inspection report until the day before Simcakoski&rsquo;s death and the whistleblower didn&rsquo;t begin contacting her until after Simcakoski&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americas PAC says Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about &quot;overmedicated veterans,&quot; she made &quot;deadly mistakes&quot; and &quot;three veterans died&quot; at the Tomah VA hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin has acknowledged mistakes in the handling of an inspection report and a whistle blower&rsquo;s emails about veterans being over prescribed opioid painkillers at Tomah. But none of those tie Baldwin to the deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One death had nothing to do with overmedication. One was an overdose, but it occurred in Milwaukee years after the veteran stopped being treated in Tomah and before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. And the third death, though an overdose at the Tomah VA, also occurred before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin (and only one day after she received the inspection report).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Related fact check:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attack on Baldwin is along the lines of one made against Democrat <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/russ-feingold/\">Russ Feingold</a>, who ran unsuccessfully against Republican U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ron-johnson/\">Ron Johnson</a> in 2016.
