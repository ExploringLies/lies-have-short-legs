According to an  e-mail the GOP sent Friday, Pelosi said &ldquo;the Democrats have to pass  their terrible health care bill so that the American people can actually  find out what's in it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Talk about a banana-peel moment. Did  Pelosi improbably denigrate her party&rsquo;s promised legislation and say  people can find out what&rsquo;s in it after it passes?</p>\r\n<p>GOP spokesman  Bryan Preston pointed us to the text of Pelosi&rsquo;s March 9 speech in  Washington to the National Association of Counties.</p>\r\n<p>We learned,  for starters, that while the Texas GOP thinks the legislation is  terrible, Pelosi clearly doesn't. Instead, Pelosi's remarks celebrate  aspects such as a ban on denying health coverage because of a  pre-existing conditions, &ldquo;robust support for public health  infrastructure,&rdquo; more spending on community health centers and  reductions in uncompensated care by hospitals. Pelosi also says in the  speech that the plan won't require anyone to pay a deductible for  preventive health care doctor visits.</p>\r\n<p>She summarizes: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going  to be very, very exciting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Yet there&rsquo;s heft to the GOP's claim  that Pelosi said the legislation has to pass so people can find out  what&rsquo;s in it.</p>\r\n<p>Pelosi adds: &ldquo;But we have to pass the bill so you  can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pelosi's  words stirred critics from the right including Marguerite Higgins, a  senior editorial services associate at The Heritage Foundation. In a  blog, Higgins named the moment the video of the week and called Pelosi&rsquo;s  statement a &ldquo;stunning demonstration of political condescension.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Separately, Pelosi spokesman Brendan  Daly offered this interpretation of Pelosi's comment: \"She meant there  was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight  of what&rsquo;s actually in the bill. Once it&rsquo;s passed, we can remind them of  all the good things that are in it.\"</p>\r\n<p>Capital fusses aside, we wondered if Pelosi spoke accurately; will the  plan need to pass before people know what's in it?</p>\r\n<p>We called the  non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has posted side-by-side  comparisons online of health care plans approved by the House and  Senate. Its spokesman, Craig Palosky, reminded us that Congress posts  the entire legislation online.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, that's not to say the  final deal is settled &mdash; or, it stands to reason, open to public view.</p>\r\n<p>Palosky  declined to comment precisely on Pelosi's forecast, saying her comment  seemed more about politics than policy. \"It&rsquo;s not our role to police  such comments,\" he said. \"If you want to know what members of Congress  are doing, you have to speak to members of Congress.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>His nudge  led us to call U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, among a handful  of physicians in Congress and an opponent to the Democrats' proposal.</p>\r\n<p>Burgess  told us it's often true that the ins and outs of legislation aren't  widely known until after a measure passes into law; that held true, for  instance, for the Republican-steered measure providing government aid  toward prescription drugs for seniors.</p>\r\n<p>Pelosi's \"right,\" Burgess  said, though \"I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good strategy (to declare as much).  I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend anyone actually broadcasting that.\"</p>\r\n<p>So how  does the GOP's statement shake out?</p>\r\n<p>The party's e-mail errs  when it makes it sound as if Pelosi thinks the health-care measure is  terrible. It's very much the opposite.</p>\r\n<p>But it accurately quotes Pelosi as  saying people will find out what's in the plan after it passes.</p>\r\n<p>We  rate the statement as Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-15T18:58:42.761528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-15T18:11:38", "ruling_headline": "Texas GOP says Speaker Nancy Pelosi said people will know contents of terrible health-care plan after it passes", "ruling_headline_slug": "texas-gop-says-speaker-nancy-pelosi-said-people-wi", "ruling_link_text": "Terrible?
