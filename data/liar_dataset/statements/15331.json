Part of Wolf&rsquo;s remarks were interpreted as a jab at Sanders&rsquo; appearance; she indirectly referred to her as a softball coach dividing the press corps into teams, and that Sanders &quot;burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye.&quot; Trump, as well as some members of the press association, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-blasts-michelle-wolfs-correspondents-dinner-remarks-about-sarah-huckabee-sanders/\">criticized Wolf&rsquo;s remarks</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daily World Update wrote that Marvin Schmidt, a supposed former CNN co-host, was fired after he defended Wolf&rsquo;s remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look at that face,&quot; Schmidt said in an alleged now-deleted tweet, The Daily World Update wrote. &quot;I mean, she&rsquo;s a woman and I&rsquo;m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on!

She said the story was fabricated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daily World Update story includes a photo of three people on CNN, including a black man in the middle with a red circle drawn around his face suggesting that he was the alleged Schmidt who was fired. We searched for the photo in Google Images and found that it matched a panel of guests on <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2016/02/watch-cnn-panel-laughs-in-cop-apologists-face-after-he-brands-beyonce-a-racist/\">CNN in February 2016</a> about the reaction to Beyonce&rsquo;s album Formation. The black man on the panel was <a href=\"https://stromlaw.com/bakari-sellers/\">Bakari Sellers</a>, a CNN commentator and a former South Carolina state representative. Sellers told PolitiFact that he hasn&rsquo;t spoken on CNN about Wolf&rsquo;s speech to the White House Correspondents Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daily World Update describes itself as <a href=\"https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/\">satire.
