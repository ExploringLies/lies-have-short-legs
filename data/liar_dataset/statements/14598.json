We need to have new deficits because of that. We need to have the growth, Chris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If we simply look at this as being deficit-neutral, you&#39;re never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions that you need to get to sustain 3 percent economic growth. We really do believe that the tax code is what&#39;s holding back the American economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was Mulvaney&rsquo;s embrace of future deficits a flip-flop, as Wallace suggested?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put his position on the Flip-O-Meter, which describes whether someone&rsquo;s stand has changed and is not meant as a value judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evidence shows it has changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Railing against rising deficits</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mulvaney&rsquo;s remarks on <em>Fox News Sunday</em> clashed in tone and substance with a portion of his <a href=\"https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Mulvaney%20Opening%20Statement%20Budget%20170119.pdf\">opening statement</a> at his Senate confirmation hearing in January 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can turn this economy, and this country around, but it will take tough decisions today in order to avoid impossible ones tomorrow,&quot; Mulvaney told the Senate Budget Committee. &quot;Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion. That number is so large as to defy description. ... I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later. I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. This must include changing our government&rsquo;s long-term fiscal path, which is unsustainable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mulvaney&rsquo;s tough-on-debt remarks at his confirmation hearing were consistent with his position while in Congress since 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mulvaney <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/us/politics/21spend.html\">made clear</a> shortly after taking office that he had little patience with rising debt. In January 2011, Mulvaney joined a faction of Republicans seeking to cut federal spending by $2.5 trillion over 10 years, significantly faster than the official party position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then told <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2011/02/gop-frosh-obama-budget-a-joke-049481\">Politico</a> that President Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2011-12 budget proposal was &quot;a joke. It&rsquo;s hard to explain how detached from reality this is, to think that the country can spend another $1.6 trillion when it doesn&rsquo;t have the means.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in an interview with Fox News that April, host Alisyn Camerota asked Mulvaney whether he would vote to to raise the debt limit, which some had called &quot;Armageddon.&quot; (Experts have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/sep/07/so-what-debt-ceiling-all-about-anyway/\">agreed</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mulvaney responded, &quot;It&#39;s no more Armageddon and no more catastrophic than what we&#39;re doing right now -- spending, what, $1.5 trillion we don&#39;t have this year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a debate over raising the debt ceiling, Mulvaney ended up authoring a budget bill dubbed &quot;Cut, Cap and Balance&quot; in 2011 that would have capped spending and added a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mulvaney also held a series of &quot;Spending, Debt and Deficit&quot; town halls around his district in 2011, telling attendees at one of the gatherings, in the Sun City Carolina Lakes development, that &quot;the country&rsquo;s debt is much worse than I ever thought. Forty-two cents of every dollar Americans spend is borrowed. Allowing this figure to increase compromises U.S. foreign policy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2013, Mulvaney sought across-the-board cuts in federal spending to offset $51 billion in proposed aid for those hit by Hurricane Sandy. While Mulvaney acknowledged the need for Sandy aid, he added, &quot;I believe we can provide that relief while finding ways to pay for it rather than adding to the nation&#39;s ballooning deficit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2015, as lawmakers were considering whether to find ways around budgetary spending caps, Mulvaney sided with sticking to the caps because &quot;deficits matter. Still,&quot; he told the <em>Washington Examiner</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors of the <em>Almanac of American Politics 2016</em> noted Mulvaney&rsquo;s strident position, writing, &quot;In his first term, he often bucked his party&rsquo;s leadership in the name of fiscal discipline and voted against several spending bills backed by House Speaker John Boehner.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">An explanation from Mulvaney</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about the discrepancy, OMB spokesman John Czwartacki said it stems from the change in the political dynamics of Washington. When Mulvaney was in Congress, there was a Democratic president and, for much of the period, a Democratic Senate, both of which preferred to stimulate the economy through spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mulvaney did not have the &quot;chance to support tax cuts with a chance of passage,&quot; so Mulvaney fought instead to decrease the deficit by challenging the Obama administration on spending, Czwartacki said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Trump&rsquo;s election, Republicans have had unified control of Washington, so Mulvaney &quot;is now in a place where he can drive the idea of spending restraint while at the same time emphasizing the need for economic growth through deregulation, fairer trade, and of course tax cuts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Experts say Mulvaney&rsquo;s defense doesn&rsquo;t add up</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Independent budget experts still see a stark contrast between Mulvaney&rsquo;s views then and now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At an Oct. 4 tax policy panel on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, PolitiFact asked panel members what they thought of Mulvaney&rsquo;s <em>Fox News Sunday</em> comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marc Goldwein, the group&rsquo;s senior vice president, said as recently as a few months ago, when Trump released his annual budget proposal, Mulvaney &quot;called for revenue-neutral tax reform,&quot; a sign that he came into his new position as &quot;one of the true fiscal hawks in the Trump administration.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, he added, Mulvaney is &quot;now saying that we need big debt to grow the economy. I think that&#39;s backwards. If you got Congressman Mulvaney from two years ago to look at this statement and told him that it was Obama&#39;s OMB director (saying it), I can only imagine what he would say.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president at the MSL Group consulting firm, called Mulvaney&rsquo;s switch &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and that &quot;there are no extenuating circumstances&quot; for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deficits from tax cuts should not get a pass if deficits from spending don&rsquo;t, experts said. Both add to the debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our nation&#39;s debt situation makes deficits at the current and predicted level unsustainable,&quot; said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if the deficit comes from a shortfall in revenue or increased discretionary or mandatory spending -- it all adds to the debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about the additional deficits that are projected to accompany Trump&rsquo;s tax proposal, Mulvaney said &quot;we need to have new deficits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a sharp contrast with his long record of statements, both as a member of Congress and as a nominee for OMB director, that deficits and debt are a major problem.
