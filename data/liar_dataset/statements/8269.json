Rick Perry, Attorney General Greg Abbott, Comptroller Susan Combs, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, whose occupations Considine said were, respectively, rancher, lawyer, rancher, retired military and rancher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Texas secretary of state&rsquo;s office lists 27 <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/elected.shtml\"><u>statewide elected positions</u></a>, and the Texas Legislature has 31 senators and 150 representatives, who are members of state government and make state law even though they are elected from regions rather than statewide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pulled together information on Texas officials&rsquo; occupations from news stories, biographies on state websites and interviews with officeholders&rsquo; aides. A full list of sources is at right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Texas&rsquo; top statewide offices</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the five executive statewide elected officials Considine named, Staples<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.toddstaples.com/about\"><u>describes</u></a> himself as a &quot;former rancher and businessman&quot; on his campaign website. Staples, <a href=\"http://www.glo.texas.gov/GLO/the-commissioner/biography.html\"><u>retired Marine Lt. Col.</u></a> Patterson and state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, a <a href=\"http://ksevradio.com/hosts/dan-patrick\"><u>radio host and station owner</u></a>, are each challenging Dewhurst for the 2014 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staples&rsquo; campaign manager, Cody McGregor, told us by phone that Staples started and owned a real estate firm from 1986 until 2007, was part owner of a plant nursery and started and ran a cattle-raising operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before entering public service, Perry farmed cotton and wheat, raised cattle and served in the Air Force, according to news stories from the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> archives and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/10/07/141090399/for-rick-perry-a-restless-life-on-the-farm\"><u>NPR</u></a>. Spokespeople told us by email that Abbott is a lawyer and Combs was a lawyer and rancher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All statewide offices in Texas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the 27 state officials elected statewide, we spotted an accountant and an investment banker. That group includes the officials above plus the Texas Railroad Commission&rsquo;s three members, the Texas Supreme Court&rsquo;s nine justices and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals&rsquo; nine judges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of those courts are lawyers and judges, as required by state law -- specifically, each must have <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/candidates/guide/qualifications.shtml\"><u>10 years&rsquo; experience</u></a> as a practicing lawyer or judge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Railroad Commission chairman Barry Smitherman, a candidate for attorney general, was an investment banker and briefly a prosecutor in the Harris County District Attorney&rsquo;s office, according to a June 26, 2013, <em>Texas Tribune</em> <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/24/smitherman-announces-run-attorney-general/\"><u>news story</u></a>. His colleagues are Christi Craddick, described in her <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/commissioners/craddick/index.php\"><u>biographical entry</u></a> on the commission&rsquo;s website and <em>Statesman </em>stories as an oil and gas <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/commissioners/craddick/index.php\"><u>lawyer</u></a> and former advisor to her father, then-House Speaker Tom Craddick; and David Porter, an accountant whose <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/commissioners/porter/index.php\"><u>biographical entry</u></a> says he &quot;built a successful small business around his CPA practice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding in Texas&rsquo; two U.S. senators, federal officials elected statewide, would bump the number up to 29, matching Dewhurst&rsquo;s 2011 statement. Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz are lawyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>State legislators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate&rsquo;s official <a href=\"http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/Members.htm\"><u>guide</u></a> to senators and the House Chief Clerk&rsquo;s Office <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5VTExdlVvZno2czA/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>list</u></a> of representatives&rsquo; biographical data give business as an occupation for dozens of members of the current (83rd) Legislature. Others are listed more specifically as owning companies, restaurants, agencies or firms. Here, too, &quot;lawyer&quot; is a common occupation, but there are also engineers, contractors, educators, insurance agents, ranchers and doctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst said he&rsquo;s &quot;el &uacute;nico official estatal qui&eacute;n es un hombre de negocios,&quot; which his camp would translate as &quot;the only statewide elected official who is a businessman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim falls down without going beyond the five executive offices that his spokesman said Dewhurst was referring to. Past that, the claim is incorrect in a commonsensical way, if one accepts, as we do, that legislators are elected state officials as well. Dozens of legislators are in business.<s> </s></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst isn&rsquo;t &quot;&uacute;nico&quot; in this regard.
