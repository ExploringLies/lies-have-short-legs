Right now, it isn&rsquo;t,&quot; <a href=\"https://staceyevans.com/jobs-and-the-economy/\">Evans said</a> on her campaign website. &quot;Georgia is 40th in income inequality, 40th in high school graduation, and has the lowest minimum wage in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Georgia in fact has the lowest minimum wage in the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does, but it&rsquo;s not alone (tied with Wyoming), and most of hourly wage employees are paid above the state&rsquo;s minimum wage: at least $7.25, which is also the federal minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Georgia&rsquo;s minimum wage and how it compares to the rest of the nation</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia&rsquo;s state law sets the minimum wage at $5.15 per hour, but the federal Fair Labor Standards Act still applies, meaning most employees are covered under the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm#stateDetails\">federal minimum wage</a> of $7.25 per hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wyoming, which equally has a $5.15 minimum wage, also <a href=\"https://doe.state.wy.us/lmi/trends/0814/a1.htm\">says</a> that when the federal minimum wage is higher than the state&rsquo;s, the federal minimum wage applies to most workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Like Georgia, Wyoming also has a $5.15 minimum wage, the lowest in the country. And while, thankfully, many Georgians are protected by a federal wage floor, many Georgians are not,&quot; said Adam Ney, research director for the Evans campaign. &quot;The fact remains that Georgia has the lowest minimum wage in the country and that we must increase it because everybody deserves a fair day&rsquo;s pay for a hard day&rsquo;s work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t get the federal minimum wage? There are <a href=\"https://gbpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Better-Pay-for-Honest-Work3.pdf\">exemptions</a> in the law for certain farm workers, seasonal workers, health aides, and workers who receive tips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Georgia had about 2.3 million workers paid hourly rates, and 51,000 of them (or 2.2 percent) were paid below the federal minimum wage, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2016/home.htm\">according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An estimated 90,000, or 3.9 percent, were paid at or below the federal minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina had the highest percentages of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at or about 5 percent, BLS said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm#stateDetails\">Georgia is one of seven states</a> that have either a lower state minimum wage than the federal standard, or no state minimum wage at all, said Wesley Tharpe, research director at the left-leaning think tank Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In practice, the vast majority of workers in every state are subject to the federal requirement of $7.25 an hour,&quot; Tharpe said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tipped workers, including servers, are also paid a lower hourly rate in most states including Georgia, Tharpe said. &quot;Some evidence suggests their tips don&rsquo;t always sum to get them about the required $7.25 federal rate,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Evans said Georgia &quot;has the lowest minimum wage in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia&rsquo;s minimum wage of $5.15 per hour is the lowest in the nation, but Wyoming also has the same minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, most of Georgia&rsquo;s workers paid hourly rates earn the federal minimum of $7.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evans&rsquo; statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
