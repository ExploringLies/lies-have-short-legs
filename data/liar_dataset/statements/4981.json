Bush after 9/11, the <a href=\"http://www.opm.gov/feddata/HistoricalTables/ExecutiveBranchSince1940.asp\">federal government workforce </a>has grown under President Barack Obama, mostly in defense, homeland security and related agencies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin&rsquo;s junior senator, Republican Ron Johnson, wants to roll back the Obama-era growth by 2015 by not filling positions as people leave or retire. He says it could save $248 billion over a decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat proposal is part of a $1.4 trillion <a href=\"http://ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=b61bc3d5-a0e9-4d48-ba25-17d4b1f238b6\">deficit-cutting </a><a href=\"http://ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=b61bc3d5-a0e9-4d48-ba25-17d4b1f238b6\">plan </a>Johnson presented to the congressional &quot;supercommittee&quot; that haggled over a budget-balancing plan before it reached a stalemate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the wake of the failure, Johnson argued it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to find savings, especially in the federal worker ranks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m not talking about firing or terminating anybody, but we&rsquo;ve got about 400,000 workers ready to retire,&quot; Johnson said in a Nov. 17, 2011 appearance on Bloomberg television.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added: &quot;President Obama has increased the federal workforce 192,000 individuals, about 10 percent since he&rsquo;s taken office, while we&rsquo;ve lost 2 million jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWere Johnson&rsquo;s numbers on target? &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National has tested many jobs claims. Its gold standard for official jobs figures is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, considered the official arbiter of U.S. employment numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChecking those numbers, we found that it&rsquo;s accurate that 2 million jobs were lost in the overall private and public sectors (local and state governments dropped considerably). We used a baseline of January 2009, the last partial month of President George W. Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about the federal workforce?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the same Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, we found a smaller jump in the federal workforce than Johnson claimed -- a 129,900 gain, or &nbsp;6 percent -- from January 2009 to October 2011. That&rsquo;s based on preliminary numbers posted as of late November.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere did Johnson get his 192,000 jobs and 10 percent increase?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe pointed us to the official executive-branch jobs data kept on the FedScope website by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe June 2011 FedScope data on civilian jobs -- the latest available when Johnson spoke -- showed 2.137 million federal employees, excluding most of the judicial, legislative and postal jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohnson provided us data for December 2008 -- just before Obama took office -- that he said he obtained privately from the agency. It showed 1.945 million federal jobs. The agency declined to comment on Johnson&rsquo;s data. An OPM official said the agency did not publicly put out <a href=\"http://www.fedscope.opm.gov/employment.asp\">FedScope </a><a href=\"http://www.fedscope.opm.gov/employment.asp\">data </a>for that month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe agency referred us to publicly available September 2008 data, a few months prior, which showed 1.938 million federal jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEither starting point gets you to Johnson&rsquo;s 10 percent increase, about 190,000 jobs added.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother important note: On the federal government growth, most of the increase goes away if you include the U.S. Postal Service, which has shrunk significantly. When you do, the increase is 29,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has found that both presentations -- postal workers in, postal workers out -- are used and credible. But they measure different things.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome researchers see the quasi-governmental Postal Service as separate; others say it&rsquo;s still part of the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you ignore that fact and say &lsquo;The federal government is growing strongly&rsquo; and leave unsaid &lsquo;except the parts that are shrinking fast,&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t you just misleading readers?&quot; asked Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about Johnson&rsquo;s data source, FedScope?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFedScope is considered reliable and is used by researchers who prefer an actual headcount to the sample-based approach used by BLS. So Johnson is in good company when citing FedScope, which his office views as more precise than the BLS for the federal workforce.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohnson, though, mixes his data sources, and there are other problems with his numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf he had stuck with BLS for both numbers, he would gotten a significantly smaller increase in federal jobs -- 6 percent instead of the 10 percent he cited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlus, the FedScope numbers are not adjusted for seasonal swings, while the BLS data is tweaked for that. It&rsquo;s impossible to judge the impact of that, but the difference might be notable, based on our review of BLS seasonal and non-seasonal data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, Johnson&rsquo;s time frame is off in a couple ways.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis start date of December 2008 is about a month shy of Bush&rsquo;s final month. So his figures wrongly attribute a small chunk of federal government growth to Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd while his data was the latest available on FedScope, it was not as current as BLS.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite all that, we found, it&rsquo;s clear Johnson is on target on the 2 million jobs lost overall, and accurate or very close on the federal workforce trend -- at least using FedScope.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut juxtaposing the two numbers invites an apples to oranges comparison because they are from two different data sources. FedScope is credible, but a different animal than the BLS figures, so a lot of clarification of differences is needed to explain the relationship between the two measurements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf Johnson had used the more up-to-date and widely quoted Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers for both calculations, the federal growth trend would have been less dramatic, though still significant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we&rsquo;ll note that PolitiFact routinely checks not only the accuracy of jobs numbers, but whether blame or credit is justifiably fixed on the subject of the political claim. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have noted in the past that politicians&rsquo; policies are just one factor in employment levels. That&rsquo;s true in this case, though the first part of Johnson&rsquo;s claim -- &nbsp;on federal government growth -- arguably relates in large part to policy decisions by Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBottom line: A generally accurate statement that leaves out some key details.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat fits our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-14T19:29:57.024321", "ruling_date": "2011-12-15T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
