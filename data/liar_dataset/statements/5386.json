John &quot;Jay&quot; Edwards <a href=\"http://www.920whjj.com/cc-common/podcast/single_page.html?more_page=3&amp;podcast=helenglover&amp;selected_podcast=rep_edwards_2_7_1328623513_11757.mp3\">was a guest</a> on WHJJ&#39;s Helen Glover show when the issue came up of requiring motorists to pay a toll to cross the Sakonnet River Bridge, which connects Portsmouth and Tiverton and is a main thoroughfare to and from Aquidneck Island. Edwards represents both towns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s just another tax on the people who live in East Bay,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m sure there is going to be a split fare between the people who have a Rhode Island E-ZPass and those who do not. They&#39;re saying that 40 percent of the traffic that goes over that is [from] out of state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGlover expressed skepticism over that percentage. &quot;I think that&#39;s mostly locals commuting for jobs,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt sounded like the perfect thing to track down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Edwards to find out precisely who &quot;they&quot; are. He told us he got the information from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and said he had his own doubts about the factoid. &quot;I think they may be using it to make it sound more palatable,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we contacted the DOT, spokesman Bryan Lucier, wrote us to say &quot;The Director [Michael Lewis] has stated publicly that approximately 40 percent of the traffic is from out of state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLucier said the percentage comes from <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/PolitiFactRI/d/81857686-Sakonnet-Study\">a DOT study</a> that tracked license plate numbers. He told us that 38.2 percent of the cars and trucks traveling southbound -- from Tiverton to Portsmouth -- had out-of-state plates and 31.4 percent going northbound.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAverage daily out-of-state volume was 35.1 percent, not 40.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe traffic count was done on just two days in the middle of winter -- Jan. 26, a Thursday, and Jan. 28, a Saturday. And it was conducted only from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The afternoon rush hour was not included.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the out-of-state vehicles, 90 percent had Massachusetts license plates, 2 percent were from Connecticut, and 1 percent were from New Hampshire, New York and New Jersey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bridge currently has an 18-ton weight limit, which requires a lot of trucks to detour around it. Lucier said the expectation is that when the bridge is replaced, truck traffic will increase and that will increase the percentage of out-of-state vehicles using it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRep. John Edwards said, &quot;They&#39;re saying that 40 percent of the traffic that goes over [the Sakonnet River Bridge is from] out of state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DOT says Edwards is correctly quoting Michael Lewis, who has been saying &quot;approximately 40 percent&quot; and whose source is a two-day traffic study commissioned by the DOT that concludes that the actual percentage is 35.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClearly, when he was talking to Glover, Edwards was saying that the data wasn&#39;t his and he told us, after the fact, that he had doubts about its accuracy. It turns out, he may have reason for skepticism.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement made by Lewis and repeated by Edwards <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
