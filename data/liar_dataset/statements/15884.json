We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s campaign spokesman said the claim is supported by the July 2018 report&nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/JTF_ChildPovertyJTF.pdf\">Child Poverty in California</a>.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That study produced an updated look at what researchers call the California Poverty Measure, which is a joint research effort by the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality to closely examine poverty in the state.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It found that 45.8 percent of children in California were &quot;at or near poverty&quot; in 2016, the most recent year examined. That matches with Newsom&rsquo;s statement of &quot;close to half.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we wanted to know how researchers came up with that number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caroline Danielson, a PPIC policy director and co-author of the study, said the California Poverty Measure takes into account California&rsquo;s high cost-of-living, as well as factors that offset those costs, such as the state&rsquo;s social safety net programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report found the share of children in poverty was 21 percent. It found an additional nearly 25 percent lived &quot;near poverty,&quot; meaning their family incomes was one-and-a-half times the poverty line, Danielson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the report, the income threshold for poverty varies by region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a high-cost county, including many places along the coast, the average threshold for a family of four is $30,000 per year, Danielson explained. A family that makes less than that would be considered in poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that same county, near poverty includes families whose incomes range from $30,000 to $45,000, or one-and-a-half times the poverty line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other counties had lower income thresholds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reach 45.8 percent figure, the study combined children who live at or near poverty in all regions of the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Danielson said the state&rsquo;s child poverty rate has declined from 25 percent in 2011, the first year PPIC produced the California Poverty Measure, to 21 percent in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Census figures also support claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The finding that nearly half of California&rsquo;s children live at or near poverty is also supported by data in the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-265.html\">Supplemental Poverty Measure</a>. An updated version of that report, which also takes into account cost-of-living, was released this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 2016, it found 22.5 percent of California&rsquo;s children live in poverty while a total of 45 percent live at or near poverty, according to a review of that report&rsquo;s 2016 public-use dataset conducted by Danielson at our request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau&rsquo;s Supplemental Poverty Measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers over the agency&rsquo;s Official Poverty Measure, which does not take state-by-state variations in cost into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two researchers, however, raised questions in a recent <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/California-s-troubling-poverty-rate-13210928.php\">op-ed</a> in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> about relying too much on that measure. David Brady, professor of public policy and director of the Blum Initiative on Global and Regional Poverty at UC Riverside and Zachary Parolin, a researcher at the University of Antwerp&rsquo;s Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy, asked &quot;whether California&rsquo;s poverty rate should depend so exclusively and overwhelmingly on housing costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They proposed using questions about median income, alongside the supplemental poverty measure, to arrive at poverty rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first claim we&rsquo;ve fact-checked on California&rsquo;s dismal poverty rate. In January 2017, we rated <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/jan/20/chad-mayes/true-california-has-nations-highest-poverty-rate-w/\">True</a> a claim by Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes that California had the nation&rsquo;s highest overall poverty rate, when including children and adults and factoring in cost-of-living. Mayes, at the time, was citing the state&rsquo;s 20.6 percent overall poverty rate for the period 2013 to 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That rate has dropped slightly but remains the highest in the nation at 19 percent, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Newsom&rsquo;s plan for child poverty</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom has described California&rsquo;s child poverty as &quot;a moral outrage.&quot; His <a href=\"https://gavinnewsom.com/child_poverty\">campaign website</a> includes several proposals for reducing it. They include, among other plans, creating college savings accounts for every incoming kindergartener; expanding the state&rsquo;s Earned Income Tax Credit for very low-income earners; and increasing CalWORKS grants, a financial assistance program for families in need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed &quot;close to half of the children&quot; in California are &quot;at or near poverty,&quot; when you consider the state&rsquo;s cost-of-living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A July 2018 report by the Public Policy Institute of California backs up Newsom&rsquo;s statement. It accounts for cost-of-living in each region of the state and found 45.8 percent of the state&rsquo;s children live at or near poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another report, the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Supplemental Poverty Measure, also confirms the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s statement is supported by credible reports and includes necessary context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-19T16:43:07.981458", "ruling_date": "2018-09-19T16:24:14", "ruling_headline": "TRUE: Nearly half of California\u2019s children are \u2018at or near poverty\u2019 when considering cost-of-living", "ruling_headline_slug": "true-nearly-half-californias-children-are-or-near-", "ruling_link_text": "Credible studies back sad statistic", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gavin Newsom, campaign <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GavinNewsom/videos/299507224173190/\">speech</a>, Sept. 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan Click, spokesman, Gavin Newsom for Governor, email exchange Sept. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/person/caroline-danielson/\">Caroline Danielson</a>, policy director and senior fellow, Public Policy Institute of California, phone interview, Sept. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Institute of California, <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/publication/child-poverty-in-california/\">Child Poverty in California</a>, July 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GavinNewsom.com, <a href=\"https://gavinnewsom.com/child_poverty\">Eliminating Child Poverty In California</a>, accessed September 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/California-s-troubling-poverty-rate-13210928.php\">op-ed</a>, California&rsquo;s troubling poverty rate, Sept. 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact California, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2017/jan/20/chad-mayes/true-california-has-nations-highest-poverty-rate-w/\">TRUE: California has the nation&rsquo;s highest poverty rate, when factoring in cost-of-living</a>, Jan. 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html\">&quot;Income and Poverty in the United States: 2017,&quot;</a> September 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EdSource.com, <a href=\"https://edsource.org/2018/child-poverty-drops-in-california-but-is-still-the-nations-highest/596285\">Child poverty drops in California, but is still the nation&rsquo;s highest</a>, April 17, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "California Lt.
