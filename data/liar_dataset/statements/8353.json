Everything goes in the budget the last minute. If the governor vetoes the whole budget, it&rsquo;s going to be overridden in a millisecond,&quot; he said. &quot;But if you can line-item veto, like 46 other states have, then that becomes a public discussion about that narrow issue&quot; and the governor might be able to prevail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Chafee correct that a large majority -- 46 of 50 states -- give their governors the line-item veto? We thought we&rsquo;d test his knowledge of the states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s define the term &quot;line-item veto.&quot; It allows a chief executive to prevent from becoming law a particular provision of a bill approved by a legislature, including a budget bill, while allowing the rest of the bill to take effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Rhode Island, it takes a three-fifths majority vote of both branches of the General Assembly to override a governor&rsquo;s veto. The three-fifths requirement, rather than the simple majority necessary to pass a bill initially, is a higher threshold that gives a governor an improved chance to win in a disagreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for the governor to gain the line-item veto, a Constitutional Convention would have to be called, the convention delegates would have to propose that change to voters, and they would have to approve the change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A convention typically is convened by a vote of the electorate every 10 years. Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis has said that he intends to put a convention call on the general election ballot in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, back to our test of Chafee&rsquo;s claim that 46 states have a line-item veto. We went to <a href=\"http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/drupal/content/book-states-2013-chapter-4-state-executive-branch\"><u>&quot;The Book of the States,&quot; 2013 edition</u></a>, published by the Council of State Governments. It lists 44 states in which the governor has a line-item veto for all bills or at least for bills appropriating money. Besides Rhode Island, the only states lacking it are Nevada, Indiana, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Vermont.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;Book of the States&quot; information is based on state-by-state surveys completed in December 2012. So we contacted the National Council of State Legislatures and the National Governors Association to make sure nothing has changed since. It hasn&rsquo;t, they say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governor Lincoln Chafee said governors in 46 states have line-item veto power. But a definitive and up-to-date source, The Book of the States, says 44 have it. He is very close. The judges rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-03T15:11:28.390854", "ruling_date": "2013-10-06T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "R.I. Gov.
