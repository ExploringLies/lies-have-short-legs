Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson defeated Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in 2010 with support of the tea party conservatives who strongly oppose the bank. He faces a tough rematch against Feingold in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, not long after he took office, Johnson, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00096\">voted against reauthorization </a>of what is often termed the &quot;Ex-Im Bank.&quot; Three years later, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00254\">he had a different take</a> on the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time to to our Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Wisconsin picture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank has been in the news in Wisconsin thanks <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/ge-plans-to-stop-making-engines-in-waukesha-b99585793z1-329789871.html\">to the Sept. 28, 2015 announcement </a>by GE that it would cut 350 jobs at its Waukesha operation, which makes engines for the oil and gas industry. The company said it would build a new factory and move the work to Canada because that country has an export credit agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By that time, Johnson had already voted to support its reauthorization. In the wake of the GE news, Johnson <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/workers-in-waukesha-losing-jobs-as-ge-takes-strong-stance-in-ex-im-bank-dispute-b99588640z1-330496431.html\">told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel </a>that he had heard from companies that benefitted from the bank and call it an important tool to help them do business overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They really could not get financing in the private sector for some of their products they wanted to export overseas,&quot; Johnson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson also expressed satisfaction with proposed reforms to the way the bank is operated, including increased reserves to protect against loan losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, the senator said, he changed his mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the Senate action, the bank is in limbo because the House adjourned before taking the matter up, although a reauthorization vote is could come as soon as Oct. 26, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson was not the only high profile politician to change his views on the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry did a switch in the other direction. He was for the bank in 2014, and then then against it a year later, in the midst of his short-lived presidential campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was rated a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/may/07/rick-perry/rick-perry-flip-flops-support-export-import-bank/\">Full Flop</a> by PolitiFact Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-im-changing-my-mind-and-opposing-the-ex-im-bank-1430868051\">In an op-ed column published by the Wall Street Journal,</a> Perry noted that since since 2007, more than 1,200 Texas companies had obtained help from the Ex-Im Bank in financing more than $24 billion in exports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Perry wrote, he &quot;can&#39;t get on board&quot; with reauthorizing the charter for the 80-year-old bank: &quot;I have been deeply disturbed by recent revelations of corruption and bribery at the institution.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Perry, Johnson has more than a rhetorical say in the future of the Export-Import Bank.
