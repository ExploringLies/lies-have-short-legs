In 1929, it was 23.4 percent. Since 2000, the share of such income spent on food has run between 9.4 and 9.9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEvery year, the Economic Research Service uses data primarily from the the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Census, which collects data from all retailers that sell food, to measure total food expenditures in the United States and estimates how much food is eaten at and away from home. (Go <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/CPIFoodAndExpenditures/measuringtheersfoodexpendituresseries.htm#fah\">here</a> for more details about the USDA&#39;s food-expenditure number-crunching.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEphraim Leibtag, a USDA senior economist, told us the percentage of income individuals in the U.S. spend on food has dropped because &quot;as income and wealth rises in a given country, less of that income needs to be spent on food in percentage terms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlack also pointed us to a July 2006 article on Salem-News.com, a website that describes itself as the &quot;most unique and interesting news group in the nation&quot; and &quot;the first exclusively Web news organization in the world.&quot; The article lists &quot;the percentage of disposable income spent on food at home&quot; in various countries, statistics the article attributes to the USDA. According to the article, consumers in Mexico spent 21.7 percent of their disposable income on food at home, in Russia, 36.7 percent and in China, 28.3 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we noticed that these statistics for foreign countries, which aren&#39;t dated in the article, focus only on money spent on food prepared at home, whereas the USDA data also accounts for money spent eating out. The statistics on the Salem-News website are also at least three years older than the USDA&#39;s most recent measure of how much disposable income Americans spend on food.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe followed up with the Texas Agriculture Department about these distinctions. Black said in an e-mail: &quot;USDA&#39;s ERS numbers are constantly changing, so there are many different sets of statistics floating around.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe also sent USDA data comparing U.S. food costs to those of other countries. In 2005, according to the ERS table cited by Black, food accounted for 7 percent of total household expenditures for goods and services, incurred by U.S. households. For households in Mexico, food expenses were 24 percent, Russia, 33 percent and China, 36 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, USDA economist Annette Clauson noted more recent data comparing the same food costs. In 2009, U.S. households spent 6.9 percent. In Mexico, households spent 24 percent; Russia, 28 percent and China, 32.9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose figures look similar to the ones cited by Staples when he compared how much of their disposable income American households spend on food versus how much households in other countries spend. But it appears that the USDA only looks at total household expenditures &mdash; not disposable income &mdash; when comparing relative food costs in foreign countries. That&#39;s not an apples-to-apples comparison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, available indicators support the thrust of Staples&#39;s statement, which is that Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food, and the other three countries spend two and three times as much.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-11T19:08:41.057196", "ruling_date": "2011-01-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples says that Americans spend less of their disposable income on food than individuals in Mexico, China and Russia", "ruling_headline_slug": "agriculture-commissioner-todd-staples-says-america", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers are off, idea is right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSan Antonio Express-News, Op-ed by Todd Staples: <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/default/article/Groundwater-rights-should-stay-with-land-ownership-926951.php#ixzz19dYB1Zjz\" id=\"b8_e\" title=\"&quot;Groundwater rights should stay with landownership; Texans access to abundant, affordable food depends on it,&quot;\">Groundwater rights should stay with landownership; Texans access to abundant, affordable food depends on it,</a> Dec. 29, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/CPIFoodAndExpenditures/Data/Expenditures_tables/\" id=\"jid-\" title=\"Food CPI and Expenditures: Food Expenditure Tables,\">Food CPI and Expenditures: Food Expenditure Tables,</a> last updated Sept. 8, 2010, accessed Jan. 3, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSalem-News.com, <a href=\"http://salem-news.com/articles/july192006/food_prices_71906.php\" id=\"rt_s\" title=\"Americans spend less than 10 percent of disposable income on food,\">Americans spend less than 10 percent of disposable income on food,</a> July 19, 2006</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/CPIFoodAndExpenditures/Data/Table_97/2009table97.htm\" id=\"das6\" title=\"Food CPI and Expenditures: 2009 Table 97,\">Food CPI and Expenditures: 2009 Table 97,</a> updated Sept. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, <a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/CPIFoodAndExpenditures/measuringtheersfoodexpendituresseries.htm#fah\" id=\"xj8h\" title=\"Food CPI and Expenditures: Measuring the ERS Food Expenditure Series,\">Food CPI and Expenditures: Measuring the ERS Food Expenditure Series,</a> updated March 26, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Birgit Mead, Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Jan. 4, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Ephraim Leibtag, senior economist, Food Markets Branch, Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Jan. 4, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Annette Clauson, agricultural economist, Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Jan. 4, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Bryan Black, assistant commissioner for Communications, Texas Department of Agriculture, Jan. 4, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "state agriculture commissioner", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Todd", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 290, "last_name": "Staples", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "todd-staples", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/staples.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/290/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.toddstaples.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;On average, Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food.
