Jennifer Beck told NJToday on Sept. 20. &quot;So we still have a struggle with those that are unemployed and looking, but we know businesses feel positive about what&#39;s going on in our economy and they&#39;re looking to hire and we got to keep working at it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith a nearly double digit jobless rate, are more people working in New Jersey now than ever before?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeck said in an e-mail that she misspoke, saying she &quot;meant to say &lsquo;workforce&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;working.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the key takeaway, she said, is &quot;that there are positive signs for our economy in the midst of some negative ones.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe labor force, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, includes employed people and those unemployed but looking for a job. People who are unemployed and not seeking work are not counted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn June the number of people in New Jersey&rsquo;s labor force was the highest ever, but that figure dropped in July and again in August.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, as a percentage of the state&rsquo;s population -- excluding individuals younger than 16 years old, people who are institutionalized and active duty service members -- there&rsquo;s instances dating to the late 1980s of greater participation in the labor force than now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for employment, the state isn&rsquo;t setting any records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number of employed residents -- as well as the number of jobs in New Jersey, which the federal labor department measures in a separate survey -- peaked in the beginning of 2008 before falling precipitously during the last recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom December 2007 through June 2009 -- the official start and end of the last recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research -- more than 140,000 New Jersey residents lost their job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the same time, the state shed more than 190,000 jobs overall, according to data from the federal labor department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAny gains since then have not been substantial enough to push the state above pre-recession peaks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn August, according to preliminary data, less than 4.13 million New Jersey residents were employed, down from nearly 4.29 million in February 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state had roughly 4.1 million jobs -- including public and private sector employment -- in January 2008. Now, the state has more than 3.9 million jobs overall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the raw numbers prove Beck wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s also important to compare labor data as a rate to account for the size of the population, which could impact employment figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor decades, New Jersey&rsquo;s employment rate was better.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn August, according to preliminary data, about 90 percent of people in the state in the workforce -- that is either employed or looking for work -- had a job. That&rsquo;s the smallest percentage since March of 1977.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeck said, &quot;we have more people working in the state of New Jersey today than we&#39;ve ever had in our history.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey has not created enough jobs or put enough residents back to work to surpass the state&rsquo;s 2008 employment peak.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd for decades the state&rsquo;s employment rate was higher than it is now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/jennifer_beck_jobs.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-26T13:51:38.806574", "ruling_date": "2012-09-27T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Jennifer Beck claims more people are working in New Jersey now than ever before", "ruling_headline_slug": "jennifer-beck-claims-more-people-are-working-new-j", "ruling_link_text": "Still below peak employment", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.njtvonline.org/njtoday/video/nj-today-september-20-2012/\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.3927908166573203\">NJToday</a>, Sept. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, <a href=\"http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lpa/pub/emppress/pressrelease/njsa.xls\">NJ Monthly Seasonally Adjusted Estimates</a>, accessed Sept. 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, <a href=\"http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lwdhome/press/2012/20120920_unemployment_release.html\">New Jersey Employers Add Workers in August</a>, Sept. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/sae/\">Employment, Hours, and Earnings - State and Metro Area</a>, accessed Sept. 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?Leg=351\">state Sen.
