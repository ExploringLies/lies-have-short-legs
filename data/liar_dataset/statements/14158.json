Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was found dead in a garbage bin in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DailyUSAUpdate.com, a known purveyor of bogus news stories, posted <a href=\"http://dailyusaupdate.com/worse-hitler-trey-gowdys-son-found-dumpster-dc-murders-questioned/\">a story on May 20, 2017</a>, with the headline, &quot;Worse than Hitler! Trey Gowdy&rsquo;s son found in a Dumpster in D.C.! Murders are being questioned!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake article said that Terrence Vaughan Martin Gowdy was found dead in a Washington dumpster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rife with misspellings and grammatical errors, the post said the boy had disappeared from the Capitol building and was found in the trash receptacle at a Trump-owned hotel, possibly in an attempt to frame the president. It said two suspects named Hamil Lalahafa and Sanjay Gemtrapa were being questioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no contact information listed on DailyUSAUpdate.com. The fabrication has been <a href=\"http://conservativeview.info/2017/05/20/breaking-trey-gowdys-son-found-dumpster-dc/\">published in</a> <a href=\"http://newsconservative.com/breaking-trey-gowdys-son-found-dumpster-dc/\">various forms</a> <a href=\"http://proudleader.com/trey-gowdy-son-in-dumpster/\">on other</a> <a href=\"http://www.redpolitics.us/2017/05/20/murders-are-being-questioned/\">websites, too</a>. None of them seem very concerned with the fact that Gowdy&rsquo;s two children are named <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-03-31/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-harold-watson-trey-gowdy-iii\">Abigail and Watson</a>. There also are no mainstream news accounts of anything happening to the chairman of the House Benghazi committee&rsquo;s kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story first&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-trey-gowdys-son-found-in-a-dumpster-in-dc/\">appeared May 20</a> on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a well-known purveyor of fabricated news stories. The site&rsquo;s goal is to goad conservative readers into believing fake posts in an attempt to illustrate their gullibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We present fiction as fact and our sources don&rsquo;t actually exist,&quot; the site&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/about-us/\">About Us disclaimer</a> reads. &quot;Names that represent actual people and places are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and do not in any way depict reality.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org&rsquo;s fake saga went on to say the <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-suspects-in-trey-gowdys-sons-kidnapping-and-murder-have-vanished/\">suspects (whose names had changed) had escaped</a> from U.S. Marshals and implied a <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-suspects-in-gowdys-sons-murder-now-wanted-in-connection-with-other-crimes/\">link to the boy&rsquo;s death to Hillary Clinton</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence that anything actually happened to Gowdy&rsquo;s real children, so that&rsquo;s a plus.
