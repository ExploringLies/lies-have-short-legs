We found no contact information on this website to probe the story further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The special <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/elections/2017/alabama-senate/\">U.S. Senate election in Alabama</a> was the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/19/american-revolution/no-alabama-poll-workers-were-not-arrested-us-senat/\">subject</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/13/nofakenews-online/no-undocumented-immigrants-were-not-caught-voting-/\">of </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/11/fake-news-alabama-senate-race-surges-election-day/\">many fake news stories</a>. This one, too, is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the story, the &quot;Alabama Secretary of State&rsquo;s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity&quot; had sent emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count, which showed that Moore led by 5,014 votes after 97 percent of the vote had been counted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones would have to pay $213 million for a recount, the story stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Secretary of State&rsquo;s office has already announced that the election won&rsquo;t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he&rsquo;ll waste the taxpayers&rsquo; time and money with a fruitless recount,&quot; stated the article. &quot;They can never just admit when they lost.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, there is no such entity as the &quot;Alabama Secretary of State&rsquo;s Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity.&quot; And the number of ballots cast do not bear out what the story alleged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official <a href=\"http://www2.alabamavotes.gov/electionNight/statewideResultsByContest.aspx?ecode=1000915\">Alabama Secretary of State&rsquo;s website</a> showed that Jones received 671,151 votes while Moore received 650,436.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore appeared to hope that military and provisional ballots would turn the tide for him after the election. In a Dec. 15 email to supporters, Moore wrote that those votes were yet to be counted and that the election was &quot;too close to call&quot; and &quot;the battle is NOT OVER!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dec. 20, Secretary of State John Merrill <a href=\"http://sos.alabama.gov/newsroom/secretary-state-john-h-merrill-releases-updated-numbers-uocava-and-provisional-ballots\">provided information</a> showing that there were 366 military and overseas ballots returned. Merrill also reported that there was a total of 4,967 provisional ballots received and of those, 2,888 had been verified. That means that even if all of the overseas and provisional ballots were cast for Moore -- an unlikely scenario -- that would not add up to enough to change the outcome of the race since Jones had a lead of more than 20,000 votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state is expected to certify the election results on Dec. 28. A spokesman for the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office said that the final results are not significantly different from the unofficial numbers from election night but will include slight increases for both candidates due to the late-counted military and provisional ballots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The viral post saying Moore pulled ahead of Jones thanks to overseas and provisional ballots is not accurate. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n'<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-27T13:21:34.425293", "ruling_date": "2017-12-27T14:29:55", "ruling_headline": "No, Roy Moore didn't win Alabama race with military ballots", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-roy-moore-wont-win-alabama-race-military-ballot", "ruling_link_text": "Military ballots not a game-changer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Defense-USA.xyz, <a href=\"http://defense-usa.xyz/2017/12/15/boom-roy-moore-takes-the-military-vote-pulls-ahead-by-5k-votes/\">&quot;Roy Moore takes the military vote, pulls ahead by 5,000 votes,&quot;</a> Dec. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alabama Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://sos.alabama.gov/newsroom/secretary-state-john-h-merrill-releases-updated-numbers-uocava-and-provisional-ballots\">&quot;Secretary of State John H.
