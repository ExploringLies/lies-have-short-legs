The original headline was. But the post has since been updated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested April 12 at a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting for a business meeting. The two men were sitting at a table waiting for a friend, but had not made purchases. When they refused to leave, a store manager called the police and they were eventually escorted out in handcuffs, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/starbucks-philadelphia-police-viral-video-black-men-arrest-ceo-investigation-20180416.html\">according to Philly.com</a>. The incident was caught on video, prompting national news and allegations of racism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two men settled with the city for $1 each. Also, the city agreed to create a $200,000 fund to assist Philadelphia&rsquo;s young entrepreneurs. A <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/press-releases/joint-statement-from-kevin-johnson-donte-robinson-and-rashon-nelson\">joint statement</a> from Starbucks, Nelson and Robinson said they reached &quot;a confidential financial settlement as well as a commitment to continued listening and dialogue between the parties as a means toward developing specific actions and opportunities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the headline on the The Rickey Smiley Morning Show incorrectly said the men had settled for $2 million, the story itself accurately represented the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/two-black-men-arrested-philadelphia-starbucks-are-settling-city-2-n870816\">outcome</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Instead of a long and drawn-out legal battle, the men at the center of the Philadelphia Starbucks arrest incident have taken an incredibly low settlement from the city with a perk that speaks to their interests,&quot; the post said. &quot;Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of early afternoon May 4, the headline said the settlement was for $2 million. It has since been <a href=\"https://rickeysmileymorningshow.com/1908839/black-men-arrested-in-philadelphia-starbucks-settle-for-2-million/\">amended</a> to say it was for $2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While The Rickey Smiley Morning Show has updated its headline, the original version claimed the settlement was for $2 million, not $2.
