They didn&#39;t know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed, she&#39;s not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t even know if they knew she was Russian at the time,&quot; Giuliani added during the Aug. 19 interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giuliani&rsquo;s claim is starkly at odds with the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&#39;Russian government attorney&#39;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails between Donald Trump&nbsp;Jr., and his father&rsquo;s business associate &mdash; emails that the younger Trump himself published on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789418455953413\">Twitter</a> &mdash; directly contradict Giuliani&rsquo;s assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 3, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump senior. Their correspondence set in motion the Trump Tower meeting that would take place six days later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In emails, Goldstone told the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father&rsquo;s candidacy, and that a Russian government official could pass on incriminating evidence against Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary (Clinton) and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,&quot; Goldstone wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government&rsquo;s support for Mr. Trump,&quot; he added, noting that a &quot;Russian government attorney&quot; would be willing to meet with Trump&nbsp;Jr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The younger Trump replied: &quot;If it&rsquo;s what you say I love it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump Jr. forwarded the email chain to then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the elder Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Days later, on June 9, Trump Jr. and&nbsp;campaign members met with a Russian national and several others. According to reports, at least eight people attended the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key Russian national was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who Goldstone referred to in his email to Trump&nbsp;Jr. as a &quot;Russian government attorney.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Veselnitskaya later acknowledged having close connections with Russian prosecutors. In her capacity as an attorney, she has counted Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official among her clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Veselnitskaya has denied having ever worked for the Russian government. But around the time of the meeting &mdash;&nbsp;and contrary to Giuliani&rsquo;s claim &mdash;&nbsp;she entered the Trump orbit based on a promise that she was acting as a Russian government agent who could bruise the Clinton campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fact may prove legally significant.
