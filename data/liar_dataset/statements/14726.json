The provision was <a href=\"http://educationvotes.nea.org/2016/01/06/educator-tax-deduction-expanded-and-made-permanent/\">expanded and made permanent</a> in December 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax bill unveiled by House Republicans <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/11/taxes_school_choice_trump_GOP_biggest_education_shift.html\">would have scrapped the deduction</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein&rsquo;s tweet was retweeted at least 26,000 times, and received at least 34,000 likes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The California Democrat has a point in her tweet, though we found two elements of it that are worthy of some caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\"><em>Sen.

(AP/Andrew Harnik)&nbsp;</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The data Feinstein cited is old</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The $1.6 billion figure <a href=\"https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/survey_teachers_digging_into_own_pockets_to_buy_education_products/\">stems</a> from a study by the <a href=\"http://www.nssea.org/\">National School Supply and Equipment Association</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nssea-study-finds-teachers-spend-16-billion-of-their-own-money-on-educational-products-for-their-classrooms-213139551.html\">study</a> found that &quot;on average, teachers reported spending about $149 of their own money on school supplies, $198 on instructional materials, and $138 on other classroom materials for a total of $485 in the 2012-2013 school year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the time frame: The study goes back five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, there has been <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2017/11/taxes_school_choice_trump_GOP_biggest_education_shift.html\">at least one more recent survey</a> along these lines, from 2016 by a group called AdoptAClassroom.org. This study offers a higher figure for out-of-pocket classroom spending by teachers -- $600 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if Feinstein had used the $600 figure, she would worsened the second, and more significant, problem with her tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Not all of the money spent by teachers is tax-deductible</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As we noted above, the limit for deducting unreimbursed classroom expenditures is $250 per teacher. So of that $485 spent out-of-pocket by the average teacher, $235 would not be deductible.&nbsp;(Teachers who itemize also can deduct more than that, but only if the out-of-pocket amounts are especially large, meaning few would qualify to do so.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you adjust the calculation to take that into account, the approximate value of the lost deduction would be $825 million, not the $1.6 billion Feinstein cited in her tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein&rsquo;s office said they sent out a subsequent tweet that provided some more specificity. That <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenFeinstein/status/927688299082338305\">tweet</a> said, &quot;The average teacher spends $500 per year on school supplies. Republican plan says they can&#39;t deduct even $250 from their tax bill. Terrible!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, that tweet sent about three hours later attracted only a fraction of the attention the earlier tweet received -- 4,600 retweets and 8,600 likes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Is the deduction being taken?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we should note that the $825 million figure is a maximum amount that could theoretically be deducted.&nbsp;In reality, not every teacher who qualifies for this deduction takes advantage of it, for whatever reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury Department <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/Tax-Expenditures-FY2018.pdf\">estimates</a> that in tax year 2016, the classroom expense deduction reduced federal tax revenue by&nbsp;$210 million. That makes Feinstein&#39;s $1.6 billion figure even more overstated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein tweeted, &quot;Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has a point that the GOP plan would get rid of the existing deduction for out-of-pocket classroom expenses for teachers. But the tweet overstates the value of the deduction in two ways -- first, because only a portion of that amount can actually be deducted under the law, and second,&nbsp;because not all teachers use the deduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>CORRECTION, Nov. 7, 2017, 7:30 p.m.: </strong>After this article was published, several readers informed us that teachers do not have to itemize to benefit from this deduction. Any qualified teacher can reduce their taxable income by $250 off the top, whether they itemize or not. Some teachers with very large out-of-pocket expenses may be able to deduct additional amounts if they itemize. We have changed the article to reflect this.
