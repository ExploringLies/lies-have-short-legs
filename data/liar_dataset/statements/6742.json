Everett Dirksen, &quot;and pretty soon you&#39;re talking real money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPretty soon, or eventually, you&#39;re talking trillions -- which is what the national debt reached in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Sept. 4, 2012, the accumulated debt topped $16 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking to put perspective on the size of what he called &quot;a dangerous milestone,&quot; Sen. Rob Portman released a list of things the money could do.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, he said, it&#39;s &quot;enough to buy both the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds 1,918 times.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs fans of baseball, as well as fact checking, PolitiFact Ohio decided to see if Portman&rsquo;s quip was fair or foul.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with his staff, and they referred us to Forbes, which is famous for its money-related lists. Among them is its compilation of Major League Baseball team values. We dug in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Indians were ranked 26th of the 30 teams -- below Toronto and above Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay and Oakland -- with a value of $410 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Reds were ranked 24th, with a current value of $424 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the top end, by the way, were the Yankees at $1.8 billion, followed by the Dodgers at $1.4 billion and the Red Sox at $1 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith pencil and paper in hand, we checked the math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith a combined value of $834 million, by our calculation, the Tribe and the Reds could be bought 19,184 times for $16 trillion -- 10 times more than Portman&rsquo;s release claimed. Unless, of course, the Dolan family and Bob Castellini, owners of the Indians and the Reds, respectively, &nbsp;held out for more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile we were at it, we wondered how football would rate, because Forbes also compiled a list of NFL team values.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey ranked the Cleveland Browns 21st of the 32 franchises at $987 million, which Forbes called &quot;the present value of the transaction&quot; in which Jimmy Haslam is buying the team from Randy Lerner for $1.05 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Cincinnati Bengals were 26th, at $871 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSixteen trillion would cover the $1.858 billion combined price of the Browns and Bengals 8,611 times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith that, let&rsquo;s check the score.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPortman&rsquo;s staff readily acknowledged their their baseball calculation error when we pointed out the lowball estimate. Somewhere in the proccess they dropped a zero. (For the record, 16 trillion has 12 zeroes, which was more than our pocket calculator could handle.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Portman&#39;s point was that $16 trillion is a whopping amount of money, and on that count he is accurate<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether it matches the value of the two baseball franchises 1,918 times or 19,184 times, it&rsquo;s still a whopping amount of money. Correcting the math error only makes that point more forcefully.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother way to look at it is he was correct in saying that you could, theoretically, buy the Indians and the Reds 1,980 times with $16 trillion -- but you&#39;d still have $14.3 trillion left to play with.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s additional information that provides clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-20T16:56:23.413508", "ruling_date": "2012-09-21T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rob Portman says national debt is enough to buy Indians, Reds baseball franchises more than 1,900 times", "ruling_headline_slug": "rob-portman-says-national-debt-enough-buy-indians-", "ruling_link_text": "Despite math error, this claim stays fair", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSen.
