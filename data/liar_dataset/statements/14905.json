The story is similar to an earlier article by <a href=\"https://justnewsusa.com/queen-just-gave-michelle-royal-beatdown-tried-sneak-spot-wedding-guest-list/\">Just News USA.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found only speculative news reports about whether the Obamas would be invited and no official reports about the guest list.

While the royal family has been friendly with the Obamas, we found no official reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The royal family has put out <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/press-releases\">two press releases</a> regarding the engagement in November, and neither mention an invite list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dec. 27, while guest-editing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2017/dec/27/who-knows-prince-harry-whether-obama-invited-wedding-video\">BBC morning radio program</a>, Harry joked that the guest list was still a ways off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know about that -- we haven&#39;t even put the invite or the guest list together yet. Who knows if (Obama&#39;s) going to be invited or not,&quot; Harry said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to ruin that surprise.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News reports have <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/obama-not-trump-may-be-invited-royal-wedding-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-722899\">speculated</a> about whether Trump will be invited to the royal wedding although there is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/29/will-donald-trump-get-invite-prince-harry-meghan-markles-wedding/\">precedent </a>for sitting U.S. presidents to not attend. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While those reports are speculative, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/01/nova-magazine/prince-harry-never-said-donald-trump-wasnt-welcome/\">Markle was critical of Trump</a> before her engagement. In May 2016 while on&nbsp;<em>The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore</em>, Markle said Trump was &quot;divisive&quot; and &quot;misogynistic.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline said that &quot;Queen Elizabeth removes Obamas from royal wedding guest list.&quot; We found no credible reports that the Queen took this action -- just speculation about whether the Obamas will be invited.
