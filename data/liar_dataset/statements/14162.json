Claire McCaskill issued a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/media-center/news-releases/ahead-of-meeting-with-chinese-president-mccaskill-urges-president-trump-to-address-steel-dumping\">news release</a>&nbsp;urging president Trump to address the issue of steel dumping.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>McCaskill backed up her comments by saying, &quot;Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Those are some big numbers McCaskill threw out there, so we set out to see if they were accurate. What we found may be worse than what McCaskill originally thought.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Jobs are going away</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The first part of Sen. McCaskill&rsquo;s statement, &quot;More than 13,600 Americans have been laid off,&quot; is accurate. When PolitiFact Missouri asked McCaskill&rsquo;s office for the supporting data, her press secretary offered a spreadsheet from the Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; website tracking the amount of steel mill jobs on a monthly basis.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Her press secretary said the 13,600 figure was between January 2015 and May 2016.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In January 2015, 153,500 Americans were employed in steel mills. By May 2016, that number had fallen to 139,900.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s important to note that the loss of steel jobs in America isn&rsquo;t a recent trend. In fact, more than 20,000 steel jobs have been lost in the U.S. since the start of 2007. Historical data paint a grim picture of the state of steel jobs in America.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3133100001?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&amp;output_view=data&amp;include_graphs=true\">According to the BLS</a>, all &quot;primary metals&quot; jobs have dropped from 688,000 in 1990 to just 379,000 by March of 2017. In other words, in the past 27 years, nearly half of the metal-related jobs in America have been eliminated.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Why are jobs disappearing?</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>A common reason offered as to why steel jobs are leaving is that countries, primarily China, participate in &quot;steel dumping.&quot; Dumping is when a country sells goods outside its home market for a cheaper rate than they are sold in the home country. Despite dumping being illegal since the 1940s, it remains an issue in the steel industry.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve seen pretty significant job loss, which we believe is attributable to the global trade problem,&quot; said Kevin Dempsey, the senior vice president for public policy at the American Iron and Steel Institute. &quot;There&rsquo;s a big crisis with massive steel overcapacity. High levels of imports have led to (U.S.) steel mills being shut down.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Dempsey said efforts to address the issue have been underway for some time. The issue was a hot topic at last year&rsquo;s G20 summit. And a global forum on steel access capacity meets on a regular basis as it tries to stop the &quot;underlying policy problems&quot; facing the country, according to Dempsey. Trump is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/07/donald-trump-executive-order-steel-dumping-xi-jinping-china/\">expected to sign an executive order</a>&nbsp;barring steel dumping.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s really tough going because no country wants to bear all the pain of that,&quot; Dempsey said. &quot;China is reluctant to make changes, but we&rsquo;re going to continue on pressing to change that.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>What kind of shape is the steel industry in?</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The second part of McCaskill&rsquo;s claim states: &quot;The steel industry is facing billions in losses.&quot; While McCaskill&rsquo;s press secretary did not offer data on the profit losses of the steel industry, our own research paints a dark picture.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Steel dumping has crushed the profits of the U.S. steel industry. Low demand and large debt burdens are also challenging domestic producers.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitecase.com/publications/article/losing-strength-us-steel-industry-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">US Steel revenues went from $17.5 billion in 2014 to $11.5 billion in 2015</a>.&nbsp;Revenue declined 13 percent at Steel Dynamics. Labor relations problems cut Allegheny Technologies&rsquo; bottom line in 2015. The list of companies that have lost significant money in the steel industry goes on and on.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>McCaskill said, &quot;Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses.&quot; Both parts of the senator&rsquo;s statements have been proven accurate as forces like steel dumping have led to job cuts and billions of dollars of losses in America.
