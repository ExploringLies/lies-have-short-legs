Both in person and around the globe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer offered a few &quot;facts&quot; to disprove media reports of low turnout, but many of them are misleading or inaccurate. His overall assertion that Trump&rsquo;s inaugural drew the &quot;largest audience&quot; ever is flat-out wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Infrastructure issues</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer pointed to changes in infrastructure that gave the illusion of low turnout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the &quot;first time&quot; that floor coverings were used to protect the grass on the National Mall, which had highlighted empty spots in the inaugural crowd, an effect not experienced in past inaugurations, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is not the case. <a href=\"http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Plan-to-Protect-National-Mall-Grass-This-Inauguration-187401631.html\">Floor coverings were also used in 2013</a>, and floor coverings <a href=\"http://time.com/4642399/womens-march-united-states-cities/\">remained</a> on the Mall during the Women&rsquo;s March on Washington the day after the inauguration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer also blamed the &quot;first time&quot; usage of fencing and magnetometers on the Mall for &quot;preventing hundreds of thousands of people being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had inaugurations past.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a 2017 Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42867.pdf\">report</a>, screening magnetometers, or metal detectors, have been used in past inaugurations, though it&rsquo;s not clear if they were placed on the Mall itself. The screening zones, <a href=\"https://www.wmata.com/about/board/meetings/board-pdfs/upload/120612_4BInaugural.pdf\">according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</a>, did include two busy metro stops close to the Mall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer&rsquo;s claim was also disputed by New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytmike/status/822966149289754625\">tweeted</a> that two unnamed law enforcement officials told him &quot;magnetometers were not used in the areas Spicer said they were on the Mall.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crowd size</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer then knocked the press for tweeting out &quot;inaccurate numbers involving crowd size.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out,&quot; he said. &nbsp;&quot;We do know a few things. So let&rsquo;s go through the facts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We know that from the platform from where the President was sworn in to 4th Street holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument another 250,000 people. All of this space was full when the President took the oath of office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-inauguration-crowd-size/\">Many</a> <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/20/obamas-inauguration-crowd-larger-than-trumps/\">news</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/how-will-we-know-trumps-inaugural-crowd-size/513938/\">organizations</a>, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jan/20/inaugural-crowd-sizes-ranked/\">including PolitiFact</a>, have noted that it&rsquo;s difficult to gauge crowd size and that estimates are inconsistent.
