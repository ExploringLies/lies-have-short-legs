But Rosendale&rsquo;s claim that Congress received a pay raise is flat wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Montana state Auditor Matt Rosendale announces his bid for the U.S. Senate on July 31, 2017. (AP/Bobby Caina Calvan)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">How are lawmakers&rsquo; salaries determined?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitution requires Congress to determine its own salary. The Framers deemed in Article I, Section 6 that, &quot;the Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1789, senators and representatives earned $6 a day for attending congressional sessions. But a law signed that year bumped senators&rsquo; pay up to $7 a day &mdash; the first congressional pay raise in American history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward about 200 years and you&rsquo;ll find the&nbsp;last instance that Congress enacted specific legislation to change its pay. Since around 1989, pay has been determined by laws that use formulas to automatically adjust members&rsquo; wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of how members&rsquo; salaries changed over several years under a law that codified a pay adjustment formula:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SVXyfn4JGuFkr76YrmLFenMNBgBS2BzxuXeEFCqNnMGYm_OR27tNwIGkefU5g9OHz12wyeEW5kIGZvmqXzA36zjqBA9fKlBPxGMlRnZu7ZrOhJUyX8fg1eGU--kWQtM13wgmHjdd\" style=\"border:none; height:272px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the chart above shows, most senators and representatives earned an annual salary of $174,000 in 2009. That year is significant for another reason: it&rsquo;s when Congress stopped giving itself raises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Members&rsquo; salary levels were frozen in 2009. Lawmakers achieved this through a series of laws blocking their scheduled yearly adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">2018 bill didn&#39;t include raise</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For Rosendale to be correct that Tester voted himself a raise, the 2018 omnibus would have to have resume Congress&rsquo; yearly pay bump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did it? Nope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The omnibus bill continues the pay freeze for the remainder of the year. As Section 7 of the bill <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1625/BILLS-115hr1625enr.pdf\">states</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2lY4QEmGvhQyVEL8dYg3LGKwrpkhmHyOL3XGeWiaxsce7bsO1Kev9_cn65ukrJ_2eKC1R57bdRAI8YKcR3GPLRpqEJdQvfKFW-EgvPeE3n0y33QzdnxbNG51YeVVmEj6N5CVt9fK\" style=\"border:none; height:111px; width:612px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As this Congressional Research Service chart notes, members&rsquo; salaries in 2018 is $174,000 &mdash; the same as it&rsquo;s been since 2009. (There are exceptions for Speaker of the House, who makes $223,500, and the President pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, who make $193,400.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rKZv5CGFGvo4YhpWPy864fOeT1_gnToZjOilwW5-Zlo9ufQ2usVVIBaEt9f0rYePuqboo4PGdObuefpfrM_4y9qhoRvT1HTh5sek5PXjpXe13uyniY10Zm3wTKh288dYhnTlrK8H\" style=\"border:none; height:415px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aide to Rosendale said the candidate had been referring to the roughly $49 million increase in the Senate&rsquo;s operating budget, as well as $12 million in salary increases for officers and other employees, which resulted from the omnibus spending bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Rosendale said Tester took an &quot;income raise.&quot; It&rsquo;s hard to imagine he was referring to anyone other than Tester.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosendale said&nbsp;Tester &quot;took an income raise in the omnibus bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress&rsquo; pay has been frozen at $174,000 per member since 2009. Under the omnibus spending bill, it remains frozen through 2018. Rosendale has no basis for his claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-19T17:39:59.774501", "ruling_date": "2018-04-20T10:12:03", "ruling_headline": "Did Congress vote to give itself a pay raise this year?
