Peter G. Palumbo was on WHJJ&rsquo;s &quot;Helen Glover Show&quot; recently to talk about his latest attempt to crack down on illegal immigration in Rhode Island.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Cranston Democrat has submitted <a href=\"http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText12/HouseText12/H7927.pdf\">legislation</a> in the General Assembly that would require companies with three or more employees to check on the immigration status of any job applicants using the federal E-Verify database.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring his talk-radio <a href=\"http://www.920whjj.com/player/?station=WHJJ-AM&amp;program_name=podcast&amp;program_id=helenglover.xml&amp;mid=21922444\">appearance</a> March 20, Palumbo told Glover that not only is E-Verify the &quot;simplest way to curb illegal immigration,&quot; it&rsquo;s also a program that has broad public support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Every poll you see, the overwhelming majority of people want the bill,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes E-Verify really have such overwhelming support?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-Verify is a federal government program that allows companies to check on a worker&rsquo;s immigration status through an online database. The program compares information on the worker&rsquo;s Form I-9 to records from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. If the records match, there&rsquo;s no problem. If the records don&rsquo;t match, the worker may be in the country illegally.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Palumbo to show us some polls on E-Verify, he referred to only one, conducted a year ago by Brown University&rsquo;s Taubman Center for Public Policy &amp; American Institutions. We found that <a href=\"http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2011/03/poll\">poll</a>, but it didn&rsquo;t ask any questions about E-Verify.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe closest was a question about the controversial law in Arizona that requires local police forces to enforce federal immigration laws. Fifty-four percent of the Rhode Islanders in the survey were in favor of such a law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did our own research and found many polls that asked about a variety of illegal- immigration questions, but few that asked specifically about E-Verify. The one poll that supporters of E-Verify around the country most frequently cite was conducted by Rasmussen Reports, a nationally recognized polling firm. That poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted May 27-28, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe poll asked this question: &quot;The federal government maintains an E-Verify system which allows employers to determine the immigration status of potential employees. Before hiring a new employee, should businesses be required to check and make sure that each potential employee is in the country legally?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEighty-two percent of respondents answered yes, 12 percent said no and the remaining 6 percent were undecided. That is an overwhelming majority in favor of E-Verify.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s only one poll. What about others? NumbersUSA, a group that opposes illegal immigration and also advocates for limits on legal immigration, last month <a href=\"https://www.numbersusa.com/content/nusablog/beckr/february-28-2012/romney-s-vocal-e-verify-stance-assisted-strong-arizona-win-tonight-n?popup=false\">released</a> the results of a poll it commissioned from Pulse Opinion Research, a subsidiary of Rasmussen Research. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe poll asked: &quot;On the issue of illegal immigration, do you favor or oppose mandating that all employers electronically verify the immigration status of their workers?&quot; Seventy-eight percent were in favor, 12 percent were opposed and 9 percent were unsure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Federation for American Immigration Reform, another group opposed to illegal immigration that also seeks to curb legal immigration, released the results last year of a poll it also commissioned from Pulse Opinion Research. <a href=\"http://www.fairus.org/site/PageNavigator/issues/poll_shows_support_for_everify\">According to FAIR</a>, 88 percent of respondents supported the use of an &quot;electronic verification system to check worker eligibility,&quot; while 11 percent were opposed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/07/25/20100725immigration-poll-employers.html?popup=false\">2010 poll</a> of 616 Arizona residents conducted by The Arizona Republic newspaper found that 66 percent supported a state law that would require employers &quot;to prove that all their workers are U.S. citizens or have valid work visas.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Rhode Island, we found two polls, both conducted in 2008 by Rhode Island College&rsquo;s Bureau of Government Research and Services, that asked voters about then-Gov. Donald Carcieri&rsquo;s executive order to use E-Verify to screen state workers and employees of companies that do business with the state. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the first <a href=\"http://www.ric.edu/bgrs/pdf/BGRSSurveyJune16-2008_percentages.pdf\">poll</a>, done that June, 75 percent of the 500 Rhode Islanders in the survey agreed with the governor&rsquo;s order. In the second <a href=\"http://www.ric.edu/bgrs/pdf/BGRSSurveySeptember25-2008_percentages2.pdf\">poll</a> the following September, 73 percent agreed with it. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalumbo said that &quot;every poll&quot; shows &quot;overwhelming support&quot; for E-Verify. Obviously, we can&rsquo;t guarantee that we found every poll on E-Verify. But we did find several, some conducted by independent pollsters, others financed by groups that favor stronger enforcement of immigration laws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll of the polls that we found -- both national surveys and others conducted in Rhode Island -- showed strong support for E-Verify, ranging from 66 percent of respondents in favor to 88 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rule Palumbo&rsquo;s statement True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
