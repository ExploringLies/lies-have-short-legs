He said middle-income-earning Americans have been &quot;under siege,&quot; long before the economic recession hit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In the previous decade, before the current recession, the middle class was getting killed,&quot; said Biden. &quot;During that period between 2001-07, productivity of American workers was up 20 percent, but median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 during this time.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid the median of middle-income households really take a $2,100 hit before the economy hit the fan? &nbsp;We looked into Biden&rsquo;s claim to find out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst we contacted Biden&rsquo;s staff to find out which figures they were using to come to the $2,100 decrease in the median income for middle-class households.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTobin Marcus, Biden&rsquo;s deputy economic policy adviser, told us the vice president was referring to real median household income for working age households. &quot;We&rsquo;re looking at the core wage-earning households as opposed to retirees,&quot; Marcus said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Working age households&quot; are <a href=\"http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_23.pdf\">typically considered</a> houses headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 54, and the median income was chosen to represent middle income wage earners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBiden&rsquo;s office cited the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Surveys for year-ending data for <a href=\"http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032001/hhinc/new02_001.htm\">2000</a> and <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/macro/032008/hhinc/new02_001.htm\">2007</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey said they compared inflation-adjusted numbers, using the &quot;annual average&quot; increase column of the <a href=\"ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt\">Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; Consumer Price Index</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe took a look at their numbers, and their calculations checked out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, we contacted Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies and a New Hampshire State Forecast Manager for the New England Economic Partnership.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe confirmed the calculations Biden&rsquo;s campaign provided.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I looked at the data sources, and they appear to be correct, and the data calculated correctly,&quot; Delay said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDelay then pointed us to <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/lost-decade-working-age-household-income/\">a report by the Economic Policy Institute </a>which used the same data. From 2000-07, the Institute said the real median income of working age households fell from $61,574 in 2000 to $59,460 in 2007&mdash;a decrease of $2,114.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/100226-annual-report-middle-class.pdf.\">The White House Task Force on the Middle Class</a> cited a &quot;weak labor market&quot; and &quot;anemic job growth of the 2000s&quot; among some of the problems that contributed to the approximately 3.4 percent decline in the median of middle class incomes over the seven years leading up to the economic recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Clearly median inflation adjusted income fell much faster during the recession (2007 to present),&quot; Delay said. &quot;But the fall in that indicator during a period of economic expansion (2000 to 2007) is very troubling. I don&rsquo;t believe any other period of economic expansion saw a commensurate decline in median inflation adjusted income.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVice President Biden said the median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 from 2001-07, and the numbers check out.
