Scott Walker took aim at the state-by-state jobless statistics during his opening-night speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Last month,&quot; he said, &quot;44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check whether this was accurate by looking up the <a href=\"http://bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm\">most recent monthly state employment data</a> published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that Walker has counted correctly -- but he&rsquo;s cherry-picked the numbers in a way that puts the most negative spin on the data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, many of the increases were so small that they were <a href=\"http://bls.gov/news.release/laus.tn.htm\">statistically insignificant</a>. If something is statistically insignificant, that means it&rsquo;s so small that you can&rsquo;t be certain the change actually happened.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to BLS, only 18 of the 44 states with a rise in unemployment between June 2012 and July 2012 had increases that were statistically significant. The remaining 26 were too small for anyone to be certain that a change actually happened. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lanrderr.pdf\">Typically</a> these states had increases of two-tenths of a percentage point or less.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, there&rsquo;s another way to look at the data -- not looking from one month to the next, but looking from July 2011 to one year later, July 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing this methodology, there were 18 states with statistically significant changes, of which 17 saw the unemployment rate decrease. Only one state increased.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the most recent figures are preliminary and may be adjusted. This increases the level of uncertainty in month-to-month comparisons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The month-to-month changes shouldn&#39;t generally be interpreted as being that tightly related to policy -- you want to look at longer-run trends for that, like year-on-year changes,&quot; said Tara Sinclar, a George Washington University economist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, said Walker has a point. &quot;Both the state-level and national-level unemployment rates suggest there was some weakening of the job market in July compared with June,&quot; Burtless said. And the fact that each of the 18 statistically significant changes in the unemployment was upward supports the point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Burtless added that a different BLS report, the national employer survey estimate of job creation, showed a 163,000-job increase nationally in July, suggesting a strengthening job market. &quot;If one wanted to judge Gov. Walker&rsquo;s statement harshly,&quot; Burtless said, &quot;one might say it is &lsquo;true, but incomplete.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama&rsquo;s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s statement that &quot;last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate&quot; is accurate, but it lacks some important context. In only 18 states, not 44, was the increase statistically significant. And longer-term employment data, particularly the year-over-year statistics, shows that the labor market has improved, suggesting that the labor picture is more complex than Walker&rsquo;s claim would indicate. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-29T16:39:48.122431", "ruling_date": "2012-08-29T16:54:53", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says 44 of 50 states last month saw unemployment-rate increases", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-44-50-states-last-month-saw-unem", "ruling_link_text": "Many of those increases weren't statistically significant", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tScott Walker, <a href=\"http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/08/28/video-transcript-gov-scott-walker-delivers-speech-at-the-rnc/\">speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa</a>, Aug. 28, 2012 (CQ subscribers only)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm\">Regional and State Employment and Unemployment Summary</a>,&quot; Aug. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Tara Sinclair, economist at George Washington University, Aug. 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, Aug. 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Tom Evenson, spokesman for Scott Walker, Aug. 29, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa", "statement_date": "2012-08-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
