Gov. Casey Cagle has pitched his candidacy for Georgia governor as a promise to maintain Georgia&rsquo;s reputation as one of the most business-friendly states in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Keep Georgia the No. 1 state to do business,&quot; the Republican&#39;s <a href=\"http://caseycagle.com/\">campaign website</a> says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no doubt. When you look today, for four years in a row we are the No. 1 state to do business in, and there is room to grow,&quot; Cagle told small-business owners in Thomasville, Ga., June 22, according to <a href=\"http://www.walb.com/story/35730268/lt-governor-casey-cagle-visits-downtown-thomasvile\">WALB news</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In saying Georgia is the No. 1 state to do business, Cagle was citing a list put together by <em><a href=\"http://siteselection.com/issues/2016/nov/cover.cfm\">Site Selection</a></em>, a magazine that specializes in business relocation and expansion, campaign spokesman Joseph Hendricks told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Site Selection</em> said Georgia had the best business climate in the country for the fourth year in a row.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidence of Georgia&rsquo;s success, the <em>Site Selection</em> article pointed to growth in foreign direct investment and the film, health and auto industries. It also listed several major corporations that have recently decided to expand in Georgia: athletic shoes manufacturer Adidas, health benefits company Anthem, diversified technology company Honeywell, and tire manufacturer Sentury Tire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Site Selection</em> is the &quot;go-to magazine for site selection professionals,&quot; said Jeff Humphreys, director of the Simon S. Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia Terry College of Business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cagle is far from the only Georgia official to reference the <em>Site Selection</em> ranking. It&#39;s been touted by the <a href=\"http://www.georgia.org/competitive-advantages/pro-business/number-1-for-business/\">Georgia Department of Economic Development</a>, <a href=\"https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2016-11-02/georgia-ranked-no-1-state-business-fourth-consecutive-year\">Gov. Nathan Deal</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"http://www.gachamber.com/georgia-ranked-no-1-state-u-s-business/\">Georgia Chamber of Commerce</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Site Selection</em> is a credible source, experts told us&nbsp;&mdash; but they added it&rsquo;s not the only one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the better-known and respected rankings, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/11/americas-top-states-for-business-2017-overall-ranking.html\">CNBC</a> places Georgia second, while <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/best-states-for-business/#1493345ae754\">Forbes</a> places it seventh. Those aren&rsquo;t first-place rankings, but they&rsquo;re still pretty high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other credible rankings, though, have Georgia lower. The Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.beaconhill.org/Compete15/FINAL-BHICompetePR-2015-2016-0525.pdf\">placed Georgia 24th</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, when researchers at Ball State University created a composite score for each state using a number of these best-state-for-business rankings, <a href=\"https://cms.bsu.edu/-/media/www/images/news/2016/07/businessclimaterankings/rankingstatesbusinessclimates.pdf?la=en\">their measure</a> placed Georgia No. 15 in 2016. That&rsquo;s basically in the top one-third of states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The problem with rankings always lies in the factors they include,&quot; said John E. Gnuschke, director of the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis. &quot;No standard scale exists for saying that one state is better.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Site Selection</em> <a href=\"http://siteselection.com/issues/2016/nov/cover.cfm\">methodology</a> gives half its weight to a survey of corporate site selectors, and the other half to an index of seven metrics, including facility locations and expansions, total projects, and tax burdens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This topic is an enormous can of methodological worms,&quot; said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As researchers at Arizona State University noted in a 2014 <a href=\"https://wpcarey.asu.edu/sites/default/files/competitiveness11-14.pdf\">report</a>, the list of factors important in siting a headquarters or research and development facility &quot;can be quite different from the most important factors in locating a manufacturing plant or some other type of facility.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, experts said, the question of how much weight to give to low business taxes and regulation ultimately owes something to a value judgment about what&rsquo;s important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Leeds, who chairs the economics department at Temple University, cautioned that &quot;the best place &lsquo;to do business&rsquo; is not always the best place to work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Cagle, talking about his state of Georgia, said, &quot;for four years in a row, we are the No. 1 state to do business in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A well-regarded business magazine, <em>Site Selection</em>, has listed Georgia as its best state for business for the past four years. But that&rsquo;s just one publication&rsquo;s ranking; others offered different ratings, and it&rsquo;s impossible to say that one methodology is the perfect one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cagle&#39;s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-16T18:29:16.344787", "ruling_date": "2017-07-19T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lt.
