Rick Perry&#39;s long tenure in public office, Lone Star First, an organization that&#39;s funded and supported by the Democratic Governors Association, unleashed an attack ad called &quot;Cracks.&quot; It features a photo of Perry that splinters more with each charge the association levels against him.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Twenty-five years as a politician changes you,&quot; a narrator says in the ad posted on YouTube Sept. 28. &quot;You think injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug, without a parent&#39;s consent, is a good idea.

Now we wondered about Texas girls receiving a &quot;controversial drug&quot; without parental consent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order that required the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating that Texas girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Certain types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, can cause cervical cancer and genital warts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCritics said the vaccine, Merck &amp; Co.&#39;s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry&#39;s order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLawmakers blocked the plans, and earlier this year, Allison Castle, Perry&#39;s press secretary, told us that the governor&#39;s office considers the mandate &quot;null and void.&quot; She said Perry &quot;will not pursue it in the future.&quot; At the time, we rated&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/feb/06/rick-perry/perry-says-hpv-vaccine-he-mandated-would-have-been/\" id=\"f9t6\" title=\"Barely True\">Barely True</a>&nbsp;Perry&#39;s statement that his executive order didn&#39;t make the vaccine mandatory.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut did Perry&#39;s move mean children would receive shots without parental consent?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBrannon Jordan, a spokesman at the Democratic Governors Association, pointed us to three news articles to back up the statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the articles quoted parents expressing anger at Perry for requiring something they considered none of his business, none of the clips mention parental consent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe mandate, which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2008-09 school year, included an opt-out &quot;in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children&#39;s health care.&quot; It ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It&#39;s automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman at the Health and Human Services Commission, told us that &quot;the child would only get the vaccination if the parent took the child to get it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCarrie Williams, a spokeswoman at the Department of State Health Services, said: &quot;Vaccines cannot be given to children without consent of a parent or a legal guardian.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTexas law lists two primary people who can consent the immunization of a child &mdash; the guardian and a person authorized under the law of another state or a court &mdash; and secondary people if the former are unavailable, including a grandparent, stepparent, or aunt.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJanet Realini, a physician and president of Healthy Futures of Texas, a San Antonio-based nonprofit striving to reduce teen and unplanned pregnancies, told us that the mandate would have been no different than state requirements for numerous immunizations that Texas requires children need to attend public school, such as the polio vaccine, measles and hepatitis B.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we checked back with the DGA, spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that she wasn&#39;t familiar with the ad. We asked to speak with someone who was, but no one had gotten back to us as we were wrapping up our research.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhere does that leave us?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry&#39;s executive order would have required Texas girls to receive a vaccine against HPV before entering sixth grade. The order included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there&#39;s no evidence &mdash; not a scintilla of proof &mdash; that shots would have been given without parental consent, and saying so preys on the fears of parents who objected to Perry requiring the vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tParents and guardians are gatekeepers for children getting the vaccinations required for students to go to Texas schools. Perry&#39;s failed mandate would not have changed that, and the ad sounds like Perry endorsed forcing families against their will to vaccinate their children with a scary drug.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Lone Star First&#39;s statement Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-30T13:37:48.247259", "ruling_date": "2010-10-01T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lone Star First, funded by the Democratic Governors Association, says Rick Perry endorsed injecting girls with an HPV vaccine without parental consent ", "ruling_headline_slug": "lone-star-first-funded-democratic-governors-associ", "ruling_link_text": "Parents, your right to consent was never in question", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/LoneStarFirst\" id=\"l4cs\" title=\"Ad\">Ad</a>: Spend taxpayers money on a fancy manstion, posted on YouTube Sept. 28, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Teas, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/feb/06/rick-perry/perry-says-hpv-vaccine-he-mandated-would-have-been/\" id=\"z06a\" title=\"Perry says the HPV vaccine he mandated would have been optional,\">Perry says the HPV vaccine he mandated would have been optional,</a> Jan. 29, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Houston Chronicle, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhpph9jp_304m555nphm\" id=\"ou3h\" title=\"Perry orders anti-cancer vaccine for schoolgirls,\">Perry orders anti-cancer vaccine for schoolgirls,</a> Feb. 2, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFort Worth Star-Telegram, Parents on both sides express their opinions, Feb. 13, 2007, accessed via Nexis</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFort Worth Star-Telegram, The HPV vaccine;
