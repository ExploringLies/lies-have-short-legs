Rick &quot;Perry has created a state that&rsquo;s first in business climate and 49th in education. What&rsquo;s wrong with that picture?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/kinky-friedman/\">Friedman</a> ran for governor as an independent in 2006 and for Texas agriculture commissioner as a Democrat in 2010. This time, he told Slater, he&rsquo;d go after Perry&rsquo;s job as a Democrat and with a more serious approach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, we interviewed Friedman spokesman Cleve Hattersley, who worked on the 2006 gubernatorial campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHattersley said Friedman was referring to a recent &quot;business climate&quot; ranking from CNBC and state education spending rankings from the National Education Association, the nation&rsquo;s largest teachers&rsquo; union. He sent us an NEA report plus a Huffington Post news story and an education professor&rsquo;s blog analysis with more numbers, and noted, &quot;Kinky has no campaign staff and no fact-checking apparatus, so he was speaking somewhat anecdotally &hellip; His numbers may have been a bit off.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rationale for evaluating Texas education based on spending, Hattersley said, is &quot;that spending affects education on every level, and does so far into the future. Everything from teachers to textbooks is affected.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe set out to check Friedman&rsquo;s measures and give context with other rankings. We set aside the Perry part of the claim; PolitiFact has found many times that governors don&rsquo;t merit sole credit or blame for the state of a state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs to business climate, the picture&rsquo;s pretty clear. Texas is tops:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tCNBC, July 10, 2012: <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/47818860\">Texas was No. 1</a> in the &quot;Top States for Business&quot; rankings. &quot;In our<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/46414199/\"> sixth annual study</a>,<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/46415564/\"> Texas</a> racked up an impressive 1,604 points out of<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/47818843/\"> a possible 2,500,</a> with top-10 finishes in six of our<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/47818843/\"> 10 categories</a> of competitiveness.&quot; The categories sweep in a wide range of factors, from business regulation and available workforce to cost of living and education.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<em>Site Selectio</em>n magazine, November 2011: <a href=\"http://siteselection.com/issues/2011/nov/cover.cfm\">Texas was No. 1</a> in state business climate rankings. &quot;By most measures, including Site Selection&#39;s own Governor&#39;s Cup and Business Climate Rankings, Texas is the place to be for business and industry.&quot; To compile its list, the magazine polls business executives and considers factors such as facilities built and business tax climate.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<em>Chief Executive</em> magazine, May 2, 2012: <a href=\"http://chiefexecutive.net/best-worst-states-for-business-2012\">Texas was No. 1</a> in the &quot;Best States for Business.&quot; &quot;In Chief Executive&rsquo;s eighth annual survey of CEO opinion of Best and Worst States in which to do business, Texas easily clinched the No. 1 rank, the eighth successive time it has done so.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn education, Hattersley pointed us to five tables in the NEA&rsquo;s December 2011 <a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates_FINAL_20120209.pdf\">report on education spending</a> in 2008-09. The five rankings he cited are based on varied ways to calculate per-student spending from state, local and federal sources combined. Texas averages 41st on those five lists, Hattersley (correctly) noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Oct. 10, 2011, <em>Huffington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/07/k-12-education-funding-mo_n_1000396.html\">news story</a> Hattersley sent us cited a <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/files/9-1-11sfp.pdf\">report</a> from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (which analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics). Looking at state budgets only, the report ranked Texas 3rd in percentage cuts of education spending and 7th in dollars cut. Flipping the rankings to make comparison easier, Texas would have been 47th and 43rd on lists ranking states by the smallest cuts in state funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/state-ranking-madness-who-spends-mostleast/\">blog post</a> Hattersley cited is an Oct. 4, 2010, entry on the personal blog of Rutgers University Graduate School of Education <a href=\"http://gse.rutgers.edu/bruce_baker\">professor</a> Bruce Baker.

States are required by the federal No Child Left Behind Act to assess such progress, but each state sets its own standards and benchmarks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn Aug. 8, 2012, <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas/48-percent-of-texas-schools-fail-federal-standards-2431131.html\">news story</a> said the Texas Education Agency reported 44.2 percent of schools met the state&rsquo;s &quot;adequate yearly progress&quot; standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow does that compare with other states?

Recklessly we plunged ahead, using the center&rsquo;s collection of data for 2011 (when TEA reported 66 percent of Texas schools hit the mark) to generate our own statistically silly list, on which Texas placed 11th. But again: This compares oranges to apples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHattersley acknowledged that the backup he provided doesn&rsquo;t substantiate Friedman&rsquo;s claim on Texas education. But according to the <em>Morning News</em> interview, we can expect better-researched positions if The Other Man in Black launches a fresh gubernatorial bid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWould a more serious campaign mean no more &quot;He Ain&rsquo;t Kinky, He&rsquo;s My Governor&quot; stickers? &quot;The discussions to which I have been privy are quite serious,&quot; Hattersley told us, &quot;but good slogans have always been players in political campaigns.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFriedman nailed the state&rsquo;s No. 1 business ranking. But his claim that Texas is 49th in education lacks supporting evidence.
