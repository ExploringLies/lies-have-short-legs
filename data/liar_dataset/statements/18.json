According to the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, its most recent, the number of American families without a bank account is closer to 10-million. The Census estimates 2.6 individuals per houshold, which would put the Federal Reserve estimate on bank accounts at 26-million at the very most because the Census household figure includes children.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:39.460506", "ruling_date": "2007-08-23T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Correct, but he uses the most sensational estimate", "ruling_headline_slug": "correct-but-he-uses-the-most-sensational-estimate", "ruling_link_text": "Correct, but he uses the most sensational estimate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Federal Reserve Bulletin, <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2006/financesurvey.pdf\">Recent Changes in U.S. Family Finances:\r\nEvidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey\r\nof Consumer Finances</a><p?\r\nGeneral Accounting Office<p>\r\nCenter for Financial Services Innovation<p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "former senator", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "North Carolina", "id": 9, "last_name": "Edwards", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-edwards", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnedwards.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/9/", "total_count": 15, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.johnedwards.com/"}, "statement": "An estimated 56 million Americans don't have bank accounts.", "statement_context": "New York City.", "statement_date": "2007-06-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
