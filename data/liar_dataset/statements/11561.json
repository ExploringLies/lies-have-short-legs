He and other experts emphasized that no Democrat has offered a detailed tax plan with specific rates, let alone rates as high as Christie says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It does not seem likely that the Democratic candidates intend to levy very high rates on the median American household,&quot; said Scott Greenberg, an analyst with the Tax Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Christie&rsquo;s claim is more of a statement of &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing as free lunch,&rsquo; &quot; observed Bill Smith, the managing director of the tax consulting firm CBIZ MHM, adding, &quot;But I don&rsquo;t think any of one of (the Democrats) in their wildest dreams would raise taxes to 70 or 80 percent across the board.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not exactly &lsquo;your tax rates&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Greenberg and the Williams pointed out that it&rsquo;s plausible that the Democratic candidates would increase the rate on top earners. But that&rsquo;s not the same thing as raising &quot;your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It may be necessary to raise top individual tax rates to levels such as 70 or 80 percent to fund Democratic candidates&rsquo; spending proposals without increasing the deficit or taxing middle- and low-income Americans,&quot; he said, referring us to a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/price-tag-of-bernie-sanders-proposals-18-trillion-1442271511\">analysis</a> of the price tag of Sanders&rsquo; proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-bernie-sanderss-plan-raise-you/\">previously</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-bernie-sanders-wants-tax-everyone-90-percent/\">noted</a>, Sanders has said he doesn&rsquo;t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent would be too high. And he&rsquo;s specifically proposed to raise the top rate from its current rate of 39.6 percent to above 50 percent. In other words, for individuals making more than $400,000 a year (<a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2012\">roughly the threshold</a> for the top 1 percent of incomes), any amount they make above $400,000 would be taxed at 50 percent. The income earned below $400,000 is taxed at lower rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders has also proposed to raise the top estate tax to 65 percent, which would affect estates worth more than $1 billion (there are <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/there-are-now-2089-billionaires-in-the-world-this-is-who-they-are-where-they-live-and-how-they-made-10026128.html\">537 individuals</a> with that much wealth in the United States today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, both of those top rates would affect just a tiny fraction of Americans. Sanders&rsquo; proposal to increase the federal payroll tax from 12.4 to 12.8 percent would hit everyone &mdash;&nbsp;but that&rsquo;s nowhere near 70 or 80 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton and O&rsquo;Malley, for their parts, haven&rsquo;t said anything specific about raising income or estate tax rates. But like Sanders, their proposals would mostly affect the wealthy and still not at the levels Christie is suggesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take for example, Clinton&rsquo;s proposal to raise taxes on capital gains, the profits that come from selling an asset like a stock or property. In 2014, 42 percent of these investments, about $305 billion out of $722 billion, came from the top 0.1 percent, reported <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/sep/21/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-top-01-us-have-almost-much-wea/\">PolitiFact Virginia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the short-term rate is 39.6 percent (the same as income), but it decreases to 20 percent once you&rsquo;ve held on to that stock for longer than a year. Clinton&rsquo;s plans adds <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/24/here-are-hillary-clintons-proposed-capital-gains-tax-rates/\">four additional brackets</a> for investments held between one and six years. The highest rate proposed by Clinton, 39.6 percent, still doesn&rsquo;t come close to Christie&rsquo;s purported 70 or 80 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie said&nbsp;the Democrats plan &quot;to raise your tax rates to 70 to 80 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand the spirit of Christie&rsquo;s statement, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it accurate. None of the three Democrats running have proposed raising rates to 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer or is it likely that they will. Christie is exaggerating the rate hikes proposed by the Democrats, the amount of people they&rsquo;ll affect or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Christie&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-12T10:09:45.757891", "ruling_date": "2015-11-12T11:25:43", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie's false claim that Democrats are going to raise taxes to 70 or 80 percent", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christies-false-claim-democrats-are-going-ra", "ruling_link_text": "No Dem has released a detailed tax plan", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Time</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://time.com/4107675/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-undercard-debate/\">Transcript: Read the Full Text of the Fourth Republican Undercard Debate</a>,&quot; Nov. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Samantha Smith, spokesperson for Chris Christie, Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Warren Gunnels, policy director for Bernie Sanders, Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Josh Schwerin, spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Roberton Williams, Sol Price Fellow at the Tax Policy Center, Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Scott Greenberg, analyst at the Tax Foundation, Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Bill Smith, managing director of CBIZ MHM, Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-bernie-sanderss-plan-raise-you/\">Chris Christie says Bernie Sanders&rsquo;s plan is &#39;to raise your taxes to 90 percent&#39;</a>,&quot; Oct. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-bernie-sanders-wants-tax-everyone-90-percent/\">Trump: Bernie Sanders wants to tax &#39;you people&#39; at 90 percent</a>,&quot; Oct. 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Foundation, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/comparing-2016-presidential-tax-reform-proposals\">Comparing the 2015 Presidential Tax Reform Proposals</a>, accessed Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://webapp.urban.org/tpccandidate/index.html\">Major candidate tax proposals</a>, accessed Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/sep/21/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-top-01-us-have-almost-much-wea/\">Bernie Sanders says top 0.1% in U.S. have almost as much wealth as bottom 90%</a>,&quot; Sept. 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wall Street Journal,</em> &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/24/here-are-hillary-clintons-proposed-capital-gains-tax-rates/\">Here Are Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s Proposed Capital-Gains Tax Rates</a>,&quot; July 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/p/briefing/factsheets/2015/10/08/wall-street-work-for-main-street/\">Hillary Clinton: Wall Street Should Work for Main Street</a>, Oct. 8, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Governor of New Jersey", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 27, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1251, "last_name": "Christie", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "chris-christie", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/christie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1251/", "total_count": 105, "true_count": 21, "website": "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/"}, "statement": "<p>The Democrats plan &quot;to raise your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the fourth GOP undercard debate.", "statement_date": "2015-11-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
