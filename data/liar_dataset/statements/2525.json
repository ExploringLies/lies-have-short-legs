Russ Feingold loves to remind Wisconsin voters he visits every county every year, with those &quot;listening sessions&quot; giving him the pulse of residents from Superior to Sturtevant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it&rsquo;s noteworthy when Republican challenger Ron Johnson attacks the three-term Democrat for not following the will of the people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a new TV ad, Johnson charges that Feingold ignored public opinion by voting in March for sweeping health care changes backed by President Barack Obama and Democrats. The topic is a rallying point in many GOP campaigns across the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care,&quot; the ad says, as statistics from an opinion poll pop up. &quot;But Russ Feingold voted for it anyway. Feingold had a choice to make. The official Congressional Record shows Feingold toed the party line, instead of listening to us.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo did Feingold&rsquo;s vote fly in the face of majority opinion on the matter?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.wpri.org/polls/March2010/March2010Poll.html\">The poll cited</a> in the Johnson ad was done by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank based in Hartland, Wis., and released 12 days before the March 25 congressional action on the landmark legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe poll was directed by political scientist Ken Goldstein of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and surveyed 600 likely state voters. On the health care question, it found opponents (55 percent) outnumbered supporters (37 percent), with 8 percent undecided. The margin of error was four percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked the Johnson campaign for any &nbsp;backup, they pointed us to a second poll: a June 2010 Rasmussen Reports poll -- three months after the Feingold vote -- that found 58 percent of likely state voters favored repealing the health care law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found two other polls that preceded the vote:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/wisconsin/wisconsin_senate_feingold_thompson_neck_and_neck\">One from Rasmussen Reports</a> looked at 500 likely voters, with 54 percent opposed and 43 percent in favor. That was released on March 18, 2010. The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other one we found was further removed from the vote, dating to November 2009, but is notable because it sampled a broader base -- adults in Wisconsin -- than the &quot;likely voters&quot; surveyed in the other two.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was <a href=\"http://www.uwsc.wisc.edu/BP29PressRelease1_HC_Final.pdf\">the UW Badger </a><a href=\"http://www.uwsc.wisc.edu/BP29PressRelease1_HC_Final.pdf\">Poll</a> conducted by the University of Wisconsin Survey Center, which found a virtual split: 46 percent opposed and 44 percent in favor, in a poll with a four percentage point margin of error.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe findings in the polls were in line with national tracking polls at the time, which consistently showed opponents outnumbering supporters, though the gap was narrowing in March 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this case, however, the polls don&rsquo;t end the argument.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA closer look at the language shows Johnson frames the issue around a question the polls did not ask.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe pre-vote polls used straightforward references to the &quot;<em>health care reform plan</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>proposed changes to the health care system</em>.&quot; That is in contrast to the Johnson ad, which says a majority of Wisconsinites opposed -- and Feingold voted for -- a &quot;<em>government takeover of health care</em>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoldstein, who ran the poll cited in the Johnson ad, said the campaign&rsquo;s language did not accurately summarize the question he posed. He noted the wide disagreement among policy experts over whether the Democrats&rsquo; legislation was a &quot;government takeover.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat two-word phrase -- government takeover -- became Republican shorthand in opposing the legislation, even though Democrats dropped the &quot;public option&quot; approach under which the feds would have run a plan to compete with private health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur PolitiFact colleagues have repeatedly probed the truth of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/cw-bill-young/bill-young-claims-house-plan-was-government-takeov/\">government takeover charge</a>, and found it ridiculously false -- a Pants on Fire. In truth, the health care law creates a market-based system that relies on private health insurance companies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Johnson mischaracterization of the poll language creates another wrinkle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you opposed the bill, it does not automatically follow that you also opposed a &quot;government takeover of health care&quot; (the phrase in Johnson&rsquo;s ad), according to two national polls. One was by the Associated Press/Stanford University, and the other by the Kaiser Family Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose polls found that a significant chunk of the opposition is people who felt the federal government did not go far enough on making changes -- as opposed to going too far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the AP poll released in September, 2010, nearly one-quarter -- 23 percent -- of those who were opposed or neutral on the health care law reported that they liked most or all of it but thought it didn&rsquo;t &quot;do enough to improve the health care system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNotably, 32 percent of opponents who described themselves as independents felt that way, and 8 percent of Republicans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe widely cited Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll asked a question in February 2010 that tried to measure whether opponents thought there was too little or too much reform in the package. They were asked a series of questions, including whether they were motivated by concerns the legislation &quot;doesn&rsquo;t go far enough in expanding coverage or controlling costs.&quot; In response, &nbsp;49 percent called that a major reason.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, given another option, a whopping 80 percent of opponents said government getting too big a role was also a major reason they didn&rsquo;t like it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe could find no Wisconsin-specific polling on the nature of opponents&rsquo; complaints.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the UW Badger poll last fall asked a specific question about the federal government&rsquo;s direct role in insurance. Nearly six in 10 of all respondents -- 58 percent -- favored a government run &nbsp;&quot;public option&quot; plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, Feingold did come under fire at many of his listening sessions for his support of the measure. But Johnson&rsquo;s ad suggests there was hard-line certainty among state residents when the reality is much fuzzier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat does Feingold say?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told PolitiFact Wisconsin that in his vote he was following the wishes of people in Wisconsin, based on his overall experience at listening sessions and his re-election in 2004 on a health-care reform platform. He said polls during the long health care debate were all over the map.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I saw polls that said that a certain percentage of people didn&rsquo;t want any bill, a certain percentage of people wanted a stronger bill, and a certain percentage wanted<em> this</em> bill,&quot; Feingold said. &quot;This bill is right in the middle of what Wisconsin people want in terms of when it comes to control over the insurance industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s sort all this out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohnson turns to polling data for support of his claim but uses loaded language to mischaracterize the question in the poll -- and what Feingold voted for. The pollster himself said &nbsp;the description in the ad does not match the question that was asked. What&rsquo;s more, Johnson&rsquo;s ad says a &quot;majority of Wisconsinites&quot; were opposed. But the more timely state polls measured only likely voters, not the entire adult population. The broadest poll we found -- measuring the view of&nbsp; Wisconsin adults -- was older, but it did not find a majority in opposition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-04T19:20:53.994669", "ruling_date": "2010-10-05T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ron Johnson says Russ Feingold went against the wishes of Wisconsinites in voting for health care bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "ron-johnson-says-russ-feingold-went-against-wishes", "ruling_link_text": "In using loaded language, Johnson overshoots his target", "ruling_state": "Wisconsin", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRon Johnson Senate campaign, TV ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbIUW0qFCNM\">&quot;Listening,&quot;</a>September 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, <a href=\"http://surveys.ap.org/data/KnowledgeNetworks/Health%20Reform%20Topline%20for%20Posting.pdf\">health care survey</a>, Sept. 25, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Policy Research Institute, <a href=\"http://www.wpri.org/polls/March2010/March2010Poll.html\">likely voters poll</a>, March 13, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRasmussen Reports, <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/wisconsin/wisconsin_senate_feingold_thompson_neck_and_neck\">Wisconsin survey</a>, March 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRasmussen Reports, <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/wisconsin/wisconsin_senate_feingold_d_46_johnson_r_45\">Wisconsin survey,</a>June 22, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Wisconsin Survey Center, <a href=\"http://www.uwsc.wisc.edu/BP29PressRelease1_HC_Final.pdf\">UW Badger Poll,</a> Dec. 1, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family &nbsp;Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/8075-T.pdf\">Health Tracking Poll</a>, May 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/8051-T.pdf\">Health Tracking Polls</a>, February 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPollster.com, <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/health_reform_opposition_falli.php?nr=1\">Health Care trend line</a>, March 10, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Robert Moffit, Heritage Foundation, Sept. 30, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Robert Blendon, Harvard University School of Public Health, Sept. 30, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview, John Kraus, senior strategist, Feingold for Senate campaign, Sept. 30, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview, Sara Sendek, spokesperson Ron Johnson Senate campaign, Oct. 1, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Ken Goldstein, UW-Madison professor of political science, about design of Wisconsin Policy Research Institute poll, Sept. 30, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Trevor Tompson, Associated Press director of polling, Sept. 30, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Ron", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 527, "last_name": "Johnson", "mostly_true_count": 13, "name_slug": "ron-johnson", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Ron_Johnson_Pfact_mug_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/527/", "total_count": 55, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.ronjohnsonforsenate.com/home/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care.
