However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/04/24/why-the-american-public-isnt-mad-as-hell-about-the-failure-of-the-gun-bill-in-numbers/\">according to a <em>Washington Post</em>/Pew Research Center poll</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The October CBS/<em>New York Times</em> poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People don&#39;t seem to like the idea of &lsquo;gun control,&rsquo; but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,&quot; said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in a prior interview with PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy said, &quot;90 percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every national poll we could find that was conducted over the past year supports this statistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Murphy&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a9c70aeb-a752-48fa-94a9-893e77b835bb\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a9c70aeb-a752-48fa-94a9-893e77b835bb</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-27T21:45:07.525107", "ruling_date": "2016-07-27T21:41:23", "ruling_headline": "At DNC, Sen.
