The optical scanners &nbsp;-- known by their trade name, the Optech III P Eagle -- were purchased in 1997.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, said Kando, Rhode Island is the last state still using them and they don&rsquo;t meet the suggested standards set by the federal Help America Vote Act, known as HAVA.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKando&rsquo;s comments, implying that our voting machines are deficient, caught our attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we contacted Kando he was adamant that Rhode Island is the last state still using the Optech III P Eagles. But he was less sure what exactly made our voting machines non-compliant with some new -- and the important word here is &quot;voluntary&quot; -- federal guidelines for voting machines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You would have to be an engineer to figure that out,&quot; he replied. Kando said he would contact the company that maintained Rhode Island&rsquo;s machines -- Election Systems and Software (ES&amp;S), based in Nebraska -- and get back to us with the reasons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the meantime, we did some research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongress passed the <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/workflow_staging/Page/41.PDF\">Help America Vote Act</a> in 2002 in response to the &quot;hanging chad&quot; debacle of the 2000 presidential election. In that contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore, confusion with reading paper ballots in Florida and deciphering voters&rsquo; intent eventually led to the U.S. Supreme Court intervening and stopping the recount, putting Bush in the White House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHAVA provided money to states to upgrade their voting systems to assure a higher level of accuracy, a better recount system and improved access for voters with disabilities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe act also created a new federal agency called the Elections Assistance Commission to advise states on how to comply with HAVA. The commission wrote up some technical guidelines for voting machines -- dealing with among other things software and electrical capabilities -- but made these guidelines voluntary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStates could use the <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/testing_and_certification/voluntary_voting_system_guidelines.aspx\">Voluntary Voting System Guidelines</a> if they wanted to have the EAC certify that their voting machines met HAVA requirements. But states such as Rhode Island, which used machines purchased before the 2002 HAVA requirements, weren&rsquo;t required to do so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found through various sources, including verifiedvoting.org, that more than 200 counties and communities in at least at least seven other states -- Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Wisconsin and Virginia -- were still using Optech III P Eagle voting machines. (Unlike Rhode Island, most states don&rsquo;t use the same machine statewide.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also checked in with Rhode Island&rsquo;s Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis on whether our voting machines meet the voluntary standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpokesman Chris Barnett wouldn&rsquo;t answer that question directly, but issued a general statement: &quot;We agree that Rhode Island&rsquo;s voting machines are beyond their useful life,&quot; and he said his office hoped the machines would be replaced before the next election in 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally Kando forwarded to us an e-mail he had received from ES&amp;S which cited three specific areas in which Rhode Island&rsquo;s voting machines were &quot;non-compliant&quot; with the voluntary standards. And we quote:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No operating system -- all OS type functions included in the assembler firmware&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No life cycle counter&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No poll open process - power on allows ballots to be read.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Kando to explain, noting that legislators would likely need something in English if they were to approve spending $5 million to replace the machines, Kando replied:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;While I have my own understanding of the three deficiencies . . . I am fearful that any answer that I provide will be dissected to uncover any flaw and that the best source of information is the vendor.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a phone interview, Kathy A. Rogers, vice president of government affairs with ES&amp;S, explained the three deficiencies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No operating system . . . &quot; pertains to the machine&rsquo;s aging hardware and software no longer being capable of tabulating votes at the speed and efficiency the suggested standards recommend.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No life cycle counter&quot; means &nbsp;that Rhode Island&rsquo;s machines, unlike newer models, can&rsquo;t keep a running count of how many votes were counted through them in their lifetimes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd finally &quot;no poll open process&quot; concerns turning the machines on. For security reasons, the standards require that voting machines have a password or a lock system in order to turn them on. The Optech Eagles, however, &quot;were designed to begin counting ballots as soon as you plugged it in,&quot; said Rogers<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a follow up interview, Kando said the point he was trying to make with his statement is that Rhode Island&rsquo;s voting machines are substandard, not obsolete. They still assure &quot;an accurate and fair&quot; tabulation of votes, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd ES&amp;S did say in an e-mail to Kando that while the machines don&rsquo;t comply with some new standards, they are &quot;performing accurately, reliably and securely if used and maintained according to recommendations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert Kando said that Rhode Island is the only state still using the Optech III P Eagle voting machine, and that the machines do not meet suggested federal standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s wrong on the first count: a quick search found at least seven other states still using the old machines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s right on the second: the vendor confirmed to us that the machines aren&rsquo;t compliant with some voluntary federal standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rule his statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
