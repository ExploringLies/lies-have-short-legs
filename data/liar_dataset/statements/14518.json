The newspaper described it as &quot;the first in a provocative new TimesTalks D.C. series.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFdZGfs9lw\">At one point</a>, Jonathan Weisman, deputy Washington editor for the Times, asked: &quot;What&rsquo;s the minimum wage in Wisconsin right now?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan immediately said, &quot;Seven --&quot; then looks upward, apparently trying to recall the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he says: &quot;What is it? Seven and t--.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps he was starting to say twenty-five, or some figure in the twenties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that moment, there&rsquo;s a response from the audience, Ryan looks to the audience and correctly says: $7.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if Ryan didn&rsquo;t know the rate exactly at that moment, he certainly was in the ballpark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/labor_standards/minimum_wage.htm\">Wisconsin&rsquo;s $7.25</a>, by the way, is the same as the <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm\">federal minimum wage</a>, both of which have been in place since 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm\">as of July 1, 2017</a>, Wisconsin and Iowa were among 14 states with a minimum wage at $7.25 per hour. Twenty-nine states, plus the District of Columbia, had&nbsp;higher rates, with D.C.&rsquo;s being the highest, at $12.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal rate applies in states that have minimum wage laws at rates below the federal rate, or that have no minimum wage law at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, a Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/paul-ryan-interview.html\">news article</a> said Ryan made it clear in the interview that he opposes legislation to change the federal minimum wage, saying: &quot;For every wage you raise, you actually end up losing jobs. You end up destroying jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tweets say: &quot;Paul Ryan doesn&#39;t know what the minimum wage is in Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked the amount in an interview, Ryan didn&rsquo;t give a complete answer until he heard what a member of the listening audience said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he had immediately started his answer by saying &quot;Seven,&quot; and seemed on the verge of adding 25 cents, or some figure in the twenties, before the audience member interjected. That&rsquo;s when Ryan correctly said $7.25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-11T15:51:55.973021", "ruling_date": "2017-09-11T15:55:52", "ruling_headline": "Tweets mislead saying Wisconsin's Paul Ryan doesn't know what the minimum wage is in his home state", "ruling_headline_slug": "tweets-mislead-saying-wisconsins-paul-ryan-doesnt-", "ruling_link_text": "On the tip of his tongue", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/paul-ryan-interview.html\">&quot;4 Takeaways From The Times&rsquo;s Interview With Paul D.
