Tim Kaine of Virginia, despite efforts to deny past associations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a fiery <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2chGnwOa1z0\">interview</a> with CNN&rsquo;s Chris Cuomo on June 13, 2018, Stewart repeatedly denied that he had previously supported or accepted support from white supremacists and anti-Semites, calling Cuomo&rsquo;s assertion a lie and an example of playing &quot;the race card.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart also hurled insults at both Kaine and Cuomo, telling the CNN host he should be fired for dishonesty and that Cuomo&rsquo;s own late father was anti-Semitic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exchange turned contentious when Cuomo asked about Stewart&rsquo;s history with Paul Nehlen, a far-right conservative now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. &quot;You have a well pronounced past of saying that you agree with and that you like people who push ugly, bigoted, intolerant and racist notions,&quot; Cuomo said, pointing to a fact sheet on Stewart&rsquo;s relationship with Nehlen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hey, that&rsquo;s a level of lie that&rsquo;s just not true, Chris,&quot; Stewart responded. &quot;Even for CNN, to go that far, that is not the case at all. I have always condemned &hellip; any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that. We want nothing to do with that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart said he distanced himself from Nehlen after the far-right commentator began tweeting expressions of hatred toward Jews and Muslims, adding that &quot;everybody supported Paul Nehlen&quot; and that &quot;back in the day he was not like that, at least as far as I knew.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo said Nehlen had already sent anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim tweets in 2016, before Stewart first praised him. He also asked about Richard Hines, a prominent member of the neo-Confederate movement who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/politics/kfile-corey-stewart-richard-hines/index.html\">endorsed</a> Stewart during his campaign for governor in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to take a look at Stewart&rsquo;s history with white supremacy and anti-Semitism and see how the claim that he has &quot;always condemned&quot; both checks out.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Stewart and Paul Nehlen</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 20, 2017, the night of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s inauguration, Stewart met with Nehlen at the Virginia Women for Trump ball. Stewart, who was running for governor at the time, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zLLTWrEWEs\">called</a> Nehlen &quot;one of my personal heroes&quot; and said he was &quot;inspired&quot; by him. Later that night, Stewart <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PsbR6oG\">tweeted</a> a photo with Nehlen, writing that he was &quot;so honored&quot; to receive his endorsement. Stewart has since deleted the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after, in February 2017, Nehlen <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170226040547/https:/twitter.com/pnehlen\">wrote</a> on Twitter that Islam was not a religion of peace and <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170226040547/https:/twitter.com/pnehlen\">posted</a> a photo of a plane striking the World Trade Center with the caption, &quot;9/11 would&rsquo;ve been a Wonderful #DayWithoutImmigrants.&quot; In the following months, Nehlen also <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170409091951/https:/twitter.com/pnehlen\">tweeted</a> that &quot;Islam is not your friend,&quot; <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170409091951/https:/twitter.com/pnehlen\">implied</a> that Muslim no-go zones in Western countries&nbsp;should be bombed and <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170518102546/twitter.com/pnehlen\">retweeted</a> posts saying Bill and Hillary Clinton were murdering&nbsp;associates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, he was <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170420082509/https:/twitter.com/pnehlen\">tweeting</a> out support for Stewart&rsquo;s gubernatorial bid against Ed Gillespie, who eventually won the party&rsquo;s nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nehlen&rsquo;s tweets escalated the next year. In January, he <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/31/paul-nehlen-posts-phone-numbers-and-email-address-critics-after-posting-those-81-people-74-jews/1082125001/\">wrote</a> on Twitter that most of his critics were Jewish, and in February, his account was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/13/585339969/twitter-bans-gop-contender-for-racist-tweet-targeting-meghan-markle\">banned</a> after he targeted Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, with a racist tweet.

Stewart spokesman Noel Fritsch <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/07/politics/corey-stewart-paul-nehlen-payment-fundraising-list/index.html\">told</a> CNN the campaign had used the money to borrow Nehlen&rsquo;s email list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as Cuomo pointed out, Nehlen had retweeted <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160918210235/twitter.com/pnehlen\">anti-Muslim posts</a> and <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20161006143850/twitter.com/pnehlen\">tweets</a> demanding that Twitter lift its ban on anti-Semite Ricky Vaughn&rsquo;s account in 2016, before Stewart praised him at the inauguration-day ball. That same year, Nehlen also said he would be open to deporting all Muslims and monitoring all mosques, per <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/us/politics/paul-ryans-gop-opponent-for-house-seen-as-long-shot-gets-a-boost-from-donald-trump.html\">The New York Times</a></em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/us/politics/paul-ryans-gop-opponent-for-house-seen-as-long-shot-gets-a-boost-from-donald-trump.html\">.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Stewart and Jason Kessler</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart received an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themaddimension/status/874609143453290497\">endorsement</a> for governor from Jason Kessler, organizer of the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in June 2017 after <a href=\"http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/in-charlottesville-gop-candidate-for-governor-corey-stewart-allies-with/article_211e1dbc-c324-5664-94d1-186aa24bb5d0.html\">joining</a> him at a February 2017 event sponsored by Unity and Security for America, Kessler&rsquo;s organization.
