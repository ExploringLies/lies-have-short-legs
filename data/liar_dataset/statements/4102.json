Some experts argue that the influence of that single policy is difficult to pin down, but others said there is a connection between job creation and right-to-work laws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s talk about job growth in those right-to-work states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPatrick Semmens, a spokesman for the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, pointed out that right-to-work states are producing jobs at a faster rate than other states. A <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/jun/21/newt-gingrich/numbers-back-gingrich-job-growth-claim/\">recent ruling</a> from PolitiFact Georgia confirmed that trend.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHandlin argued that higher personal income and lower unemployment rates are examples of right-to-work leading to job growth. Semmens and Handlin both referred to the research done by Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVedder told us right-to-work laws were associated with job creation. Even accounting for other factors, right-to-work laws produce positive economic outcomes, he wrote in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet some right-to-work states have no state income tax, which could make the relationship between right-to-work laws and income growth seem like a &quot;mirage,&quot; Vedder wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVedder acknowledged how job growth is greater in right-to-work states, but added &quot;that showing a statistical relationship does not necessarily imply <em>causation</em>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, are right-to-work laws the reason for the job growth in those states?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOliver&rsquo;s spokesman, Tom Hester Jr., sent us an April study from the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, that supports the assemblywoman&rsquo;s argument. That study claims that since both sets of states &quot;can foster booming job markets, then something in these states&rsquo; economies, demographics, or policies <em>other than RTW</em> must be driving their growth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoland Zullo, a research scientist in labor and economic studies at the University of Michigan, said there&rsquo;s no convincing research proving a link between right-to-work laws and job growth or decline. Other factors, such as tax packages, could explain what&rsquo;s driving companies to right-to-work states, Zullo said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother recent study by two economics professors reached a mixed conclusion on the subject. In terms of manufacturing employment, a right-to-work law had no significant impact in Oklahoma, but another right-to-work law increased the number of jobs in Idaho, according to an email from those professors, Serkan Ozbeklik and Ozkan Eren.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRight-to-work laws likely create jobs, but part of the job growth is probably the result of other business-friendly policies in right-to-work states, according to Ozbeklik and Eren.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tW. Robert Reed, an economics professor in New Zealand, who had researched right-to-work laws while working in Oklahoma, wrote in a series of emails that right-to-work laws create jobs and increase wages. Right-to-work limits the ability of unions to negotiate benefits to the point of discouraging companies from hiring new employees, Reed wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Reed noted, as Vedder did earlier, that &quot;correlation does not prove causation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Did wages grow faster in RTW states because of RTW legislation? Or because of other factors? That&#39;s virtually impossible to determine,&quot; Reed wrote. &quot;So many other factors could also have been responsible for job and wage growth in those states.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that the research is also divided on whether right-to-work laws reduce workers&rsquo; wages, as Oliver suggested.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo studies from the Economic Policy Institute suggest workers in right-to-work states earn less than their counterparts in other states. Ozbeklik and Eren found that right-to-work led to reduced non-union wages in the private sector in Oklahoma.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Reed argued in a 2003 study that average wages are higher in right-to-work states, when factoring in state economic conditions at the time the right-to-work laws were adopted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOliver claimed that studies show &quot;right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth.&quot; According to different studies and economic experts, the evidence is mixed that right-to-work laws spur job growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRight-to-work states have seen greater job increases, but one economist pointed out that such a dynamic doesn&rsquo;t prove right-to-work laws were the cause. Another professor who believes job growth results from right-to-work laws acknowledged that many other factors also could be responsible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Oliver&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/politifact_new_jersey_assembly.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-13T15:49:04.795278", "ruling_date": "2011-07-15T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "New Jersey Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver says studies show right-to-work laws don\u2019t spur job growth", "ruling_headline_slug": "new-jersey-assembly-speaker-sheila-oliver-says-stu", "ruling_link_text": "Research is mixed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey Assembly Democrats, <a href=\"http://www.assemblydems.com/Article.asp?ArticleID=4355\">Speaker Oliver: Republican Anti-Worker Bill &lsquo;Dead On Arrival,&rsquo;</a>July 8, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interviews with Tom Hester Jr., <a href=\"http://www.assemblydems.com/staff.asp?StaffID=Hester\">spokesman for Assembly Democrats</a>, July 11-12, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Patrick Semmens, <a href=\"http://www.nilrr.org/\">National Institute for Labor Relations Research</a>, July 11, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/BIO.asp?Leg=254\">Assemblywoman Amy Handlin</a>, July 11, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.njassemblyrepublicans.com/press_release.php?id=2137\">Don&rsquo;t Force Union Membership</a>, press release from Amy Handlin, June 3, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/jun/21/newt-gingrich/numbers-back-gingrich-job-growth-claim/\">Numbers back up Gingrich job growth claim</a>, June 21, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCato Journal, <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj30n1/cj30n1-9.pdf\">Right-To-Work Laws: Liberty, Prosperity, And Quality Of Life</a>, winter 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interviews with Richard Vedder, <a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/economics/vedder.html\">Ohio University Department of Economics</a>, July 11, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEconomic Policy Institute, <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/page/-/BriefingPaper300.pdf?nocdn=1\">Does &lsquo;Right-To-Work&rsquo; Create Jobs?
