(We also analyze a statement by House Minority Leader John Boehner.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;ll take the claims in order.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; <b>Did the economy shed 3 million jobs during the last six months of President George W. Bush&#39;s administration?</b> Actually, that understates the losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn July 2008, the general employment level was 137,075,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2009, it was 133,549,000 -- a decline of about 3.5 million jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; <b>Did the economy shed 3.6 million or 3.7 million jobs in the first six months under Obama? </b>That modestly overstates the losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn January 2009, the general employment level was 133,549,000. In July 2009, it was 130,294,000. That&#39;s a decline of 3.26 million jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; <b>Did the economy add almost 600,000 private sector jobs during the first six months of this year? </b>Very, very close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn December 2009, the number of private-sector jobs stood at 107,107,000. By June 2010, the number was 107,700,000. That&#39;s a difference of 593,000 jobs -- &quot;almost 600,000&quot; in our book.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn all, Biden&#39;s numbers understated the losses under Bush and overstated the losses under Obama, but both of these errors work against the administration&#39;s own interests. And in the third case, Biden&#39;s number easily qualifies as &quot;almost 600,000.&quot; All in all, we rate Biden&#39;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-15T15:17:27.536243", "ruling_date": "2010-07-15T17:23:11", "ruling_headline": "Joe Biden lauds Obama's job creation record", "ruling_headline_slug": "joe-biden-lauds-obamas-job-creation-record", "ruling_link_text": "He's pretty close", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJoe Biden, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/assessing-economic-impact-recovery-act\" id=\"wvee\" title=\"video of a press conference on the economic stimulus \r\nbill\">video of a press conference on the economic stimulus bill</a>, July 14, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm\" id=\"m-i4\" title=\"search form\">search form</a> for Table B-1.
