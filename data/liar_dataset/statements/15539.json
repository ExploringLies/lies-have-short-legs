The story said that Russell showed Trump&rsquo;s &quot;famous foes that it&rsquo;s time to shut up about our president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook&#39;s News Feed.

I don&rsquo;t begrudge them that. I&rsquo;m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said that Russell made those comments in response to Meryl Streep&rsquo;s comments at the Golden Globes. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2WYTjO5aWU\">Streep&rsquo;s criticism of Trump</a> for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wrong-say-he-moc/\">imitating a disabled reporter</a> occurred at the awards ceremony in January 2017 while that quote by Russell was published in September 2016 in an interview with Stephen Whitty, a freelance critic at the time for <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/09/kurt_russell_on_deepwater_horizon_hollywood_and_mo.html\">The New Jersey <em>Star-Ledger</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whitty told PolitiFact that Russell &quot;was talking, very generally, about being a libertarian or conservative in Hollywood&quot; and that he didn&rsquo;t recall him ever mentioning any candidate by name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The twentyeightmay story also said that Russell recently said: &quot;The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russell did make that statement, but that was on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tqN442gppA&amp;t=1156s\"><em>The View</em> in December 2015</a> when Whoopi Goldberg asked him about his recent comments that he believed gun control laws wouldn&rsquo;t deter terrorists. At the time he made statements about gun control, he was discussing his upcoming movie The Hateful Eight, directed by Quentin Tarantino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political. It&#39;s just something I can&#39;t stand watching. So having said that, no, I was asked, I was asked to put it in context somehow with this movie. You know, my personal feeling is that there&#39;s a big difference between fantasyland and reality. Fantasyland is what we do. You&#39;re either writing something, writing a song, writing a book, doing a movie, doing a television show. That&#39;s fantasyland. And that&rsquo;s where that stuff belongs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russell continued, saying that people have different opinions about how to deal with terrorism and he talked about his views on why the Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were unable to find any contact information on the <a href=\"http://twentyeightmay.pw/\">twentyeightmay website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A story by the Twentyeightmay website said that actor Kurt Russell said that celebrities shouldn&#39;t &quot;get political&quot; when it comes to Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a case of using an actual quote by an actor but taking it out of context to create a false impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russell said in a December 2015 interview on The View, &quot;The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political.&quot; But the Twentyeightmay story portrayed Russell&rsquo;s quotes as an attack on Trump, and that wasn&rsquo;t the case.
