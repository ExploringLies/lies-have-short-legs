Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, recently defended Gov. Terry McAuliffe&rsquo;s decision to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons who have served their time and said Republicans opposing the action want to suppress turnout in this fall&rsquo;s presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locke participated in a May 8 <a href=\"http://newsone.com/3428450/lawmakers-in-virginia-sue-over-blanket-restorations-of-ex-felons-voting-rights/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>panel discussion</u></a> of McAuliffe&rsquo;s decree conducted by NewsOne.com, an outlet <a href=\"http://newsone.com/about-us/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>dedicated</u></a> to presenting news to black Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s this feeling that somehow, since the governor did this, that somehow this state is once again going to vote for a Democrat for president of the United States,&quot; she said. &quot;So that is the fear, that somehow, these 206,000 individuals are going to vote for a Democrat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We do not have voters in this country flocking to the polls,&quot; she added. &quot;The United States has a low voter turnout rate. You would think that you would want individuals voting in this country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of Republicans who are accusing McAuliffe of issuing the blanket restoration of rights to help presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton - his good friend and fellow Democrat - carry Virginia this fall. What caught our attention is Locke&rsquo;s claim that the U.S. has a low voter turnout. We wondered if she&rsquo;s right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locke pointed us to a May 2015 <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/06/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>study</u></a> by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. It examined voter turnout in the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 democratic nations - mostly with industrialized economies - seeking to improve trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Voting-age population</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew looked at OECD members&rsquo; most recent national elections. It computed the votes cast as a percentage of each country&rsquo;s estimated voting-age population. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the U.S., Pew estimated that 53.6 percent of citizens old enough to vote participated in the 2012 presidential election. That ranked 31st among OECD nations. The only trailers were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Japan, 52 percent in 2014;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Chile, 45.7 percent in 2013; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Switzerland, 40 percent in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the five countries with the highest age-eligible turnout were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Belgium, 87.2 percent in 2014;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Turkey, 86.4 percent in 2011;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Sweden, 82.6 percent in 2014;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Denmark, 81.8 percent in 2011; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Australia, 80.5 percent in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that three of the top five - Belgium, Turkey and Australia - have mandatory voting laws. There are <a href=\"http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>14 nations</u></a> in the world that enforce such statutes, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Registered voter turnout</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Pew&rsquo;s 53.6 percent voting-age participation estimate for the U.S. in 2012 sounds low to you, there&rsquo;s a good reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turnout often is expressed as the percentage of registered voters who cast ballots and, under this measure, the U.S. does fairly well. In 2012, when President Barack Obama won a second-term challenge from Republican Mitt Romney, 84.3 of registered voters went to the polls - ranking seventh in that measurement among OECD countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Pew says national turnout comparisons based on registered voters &quot;may not be very meaningful.&quot; That&rsquo;s because &quot;in most countries, the government takes the lead in getting people&rsquo;s names on the rolls - whether by registering them automatically (as in, for example Sweden or Germany) or by aggressively seeking out and registering eligible voters (as in the U.K. and Australia). As a result, turnout looks pretty similar regardless of whether you&rsquo;re looking at voting-age population or registered voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the U.S., by contrast, registration is mainly an individual responsibility,&quot; Pew says. &quot;And registered voters represent a much smaller share of potential voters in the U.S. than just about any other OECD country: Only 65 percent of the U.S. voting age population (and 71 percent of the voting-age citizenry) is registered, according to the Census Bureau, compared with 96 percent in Sweden and 93 percent in the U.K.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For these reasons, Pew said that political scientists &quot;typically&quot; measure turnout by looking at the percentage of age-eligible people who went to the polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We<strong> </strong>found one other data source that compares election turnouts based on countries&rsquo; voting-age population. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance compiles that information for 109 nations and territories. The U.S., with its 53.6 percent turnout in 2012, ranked 73rd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top on its list is Uzbekistan, a landlocked former member of the Soviet Union, where 98.4 percent of age-eligible people voted in its 2015 presidential election. At the bottom is Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation, had an 18.9 percent turnout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locke said &quot;The United States has a low voter turnout rate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She based her statement on a Pew study that shows the U.S. ranks 31st among 34 OECD nations in the percentage of age-eligible people who cast ballots in recent national elections. Wider data, compiled by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, ranks the U.S. 73rd among 109 nations and territories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Locke&rsquo;s statement True.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a34e0a1-00c6-40eb-9cc4-c69d3930a7b4\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a34e0a1-00c6-40eb-9cc4-c69d3930a7b4</a> \r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-15T22:25:08.161003", "ruling_date": "2016-05-16T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mamie Locke says U.S. has a low voter turnout rate", "ruling_headline_slug": "mamie-locke-says-us-has-low-voter-turnout-rate", "ruling_link_text": "Low registration rate, too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>State Sen.
