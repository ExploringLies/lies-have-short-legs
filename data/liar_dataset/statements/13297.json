A conviction of the misdemeanor offense carries a potential county jail sentence as well as a fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger&rsquo;s complaint focuses on a flier mailed to voters on Oct. 14 by the group. The mailer states: &quot;When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China. She wanted taxpayers to pay the bill for her airfare, lodging, transportation and food.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mailer clearly gives the impression that not only did Zenzinger vote to take a taxpayer-funded trip, but she went on the trip to China, too. In a mailer photograph, the group inserted a traditional Vietnamese bamboo hat on Zenzinger&rsquo;s head with a Chinese rooftop in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly,&quot; Zenzinger told Denver7 and PolitiFact. &quot;The reason I&#39;m filing the complaint is that I believe that they actually have crossed the line to where this is criminal. It&#39;s not even a stretching of the truth. It&#39;s just not the truth, and it&#39;s being used to influence voters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That needs to stop,&quot; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government but hadn&rsquo;t received a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 5, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/colorado/statements/2016/jul/05/colorado-citizens-accountable-government/group-says-colorado-senate-candidate-voted-China/\">PolitiFact and its partner Denver7 checked</a> the facts of an earlier mailer from Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government that said, &quot;While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact rated the mailer Pants on Fire, its worst rating reserved for ridiculous statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are key problems with these attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No city officials ever went on the trip. But you wouldn&rsquo;t know that from this mailer, or a 2014<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339q4aimIos&amp;index=3&amp;list=UUevQu4Ys9BVrhHCPY6E4SUQ\"> TV ad</a> called &quot;China Girl&quot; that targeted Zenzinger, who was running to hang onto her Senate seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2013, Zenzinger was a newly appointed Arvada City Councilwoman who took part in a motion regarding a sister city agreement with the Chinese city of Jinzhou.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Jinzhou to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A nonprofit group, Arvada Sister Cities International, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Councilman Bob Dyer made a motion to accept the group&rsquo;s recommendation and send a delegation to Jinzhou, <a href=\"http://www.arvadarecords.org/councilpacket/past24_minutes/2013...04-01-2013%20City%20Council%20Meeting%20Minutes.pdf\">according to the meeting minutes</a>. The motion made no mention of funding for the trip, according to the minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mayor said &quot;since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it,&quot; according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, no taxpayer money would be used. &quot;Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified ... that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation,&quot; according to the minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her motion passed 5-2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, &quot;When Rachel Zenzinger was on the Arvada City Council, she voted to spend taxpayer funds for a junket to China.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of a council member, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China. But not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China, but she never even went to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attack is a brazen, repeated distortion of the facts.
