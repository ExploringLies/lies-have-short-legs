That&#39;s simply not true, and the world knows it&#39;s not true, and the Republicans know it&#39;s not true. We went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus trillion debt when George (W.) Bush left office. So to say it is Obama&#39;s debt and that the debt limit needs to be extended because of Obama is simply not true.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA reader asked us to check Hoyer&rsquo;s claim that the United States &quot;went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus-trillion debt when George Bush left office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the way we initially looked at it. We turned to a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist01z1.xls\">historical table</a> published annually by the Office of Management and Budget. The table reports that during fiscal year 2001 -- which included much of Bush&rsquo;s first year in office, and which was based on a budget assembled during the term of his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton -- there was a surplus of $128 billion. So Hoyer was right that there was a surplus, but it was only 2 percent of the amount Hoyer indicated it was.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, according to the <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">Treasury Department</a>, the level of debt when Bush left office on Jan. 20, 2009, was either $6.307 trillion (the amount of debt held by the public) or $10.627 trillion (the amount of publicly held debt plus debt held by the government, including the Social Security and Medicare trust funds). With the latter measure, Hoyer&rsquo;s in the ballpark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut when we spoke to Hoyer&rsquo;s office, they said he was actually using a different yardstick for the first figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey said Hoyer was referring to the $5.61 trillion in surpluses that the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress -- <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=2727&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=1\">had predicted</a> in January 2001 would materialize over the next 10 years, based on the fiscal outlook at the end of Clinton&rsquo;s tenure. (Hoyer&rsquo;s office confirmed our conclusion about the second figure.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO number provides support for Hoyer&rsquo;s claim, but we think that his failure to make clear that he was comparing a projected surplus to the deficit weaken his argument.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven Hoyer&rsquo;s wording -- that when Bush came into office he &quot;inherited&quot; a $5.6 trillion surplus, we think a viewer would assume that it&rsquo;s both a tangible figure, and that it refers to a specific point in time. In reality, it&rsquo;s neither. It&rsquo;s a projection of future surpluses, and it&rsquo;s a figure that covers a 10-year period. In fact, the final two years of those surpluses wouldn&rsquo;t even fall within Bush&rsquo;s two terms in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is some merit in Hoyer&rsquo;s larger point -- that Bush came into office with a rosy fiscal outlook and left with one that was far less so. And he&rsquo;s pretty close when he says that Bush left an &quot;$11-plus trillion debt&quot; when he departed the Oval Office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Hoyer left out enough qualifiers -- that the number was a projection, and that it covered 10 years -- that we believe viewers would take away an exaggerated impression of the fiscal picture Bush inherited. So we&rsquo;re giving Hoyer&rsquo;s comment a rating of Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-01T17:20:03.502693", "ruling_date": "2011-06-02T11:41:34", "ruling_headline": "Steny Hoyer says George W.
