Hundreds marched June 21 in South Carolina cities to protest the flag remaining unfurled on government property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the oddities is that while the U.S. and South Carolina flags are flying at half-staff, the Confederate flag remains at full-staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN reporter Jean Casarez explained the situation to viewers on June 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;By law, it must fly at a height of 30 feet,&quot; she said. &quot;Any changes &mdash; taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done &mdash; must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve seen many versions of this claim, so we wanted to give it a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Carolina&rsquo;s Code of Laws allows the governor to order the lowering of the state and U.S. flags flying atop the capitol building to half-staff, which Gov. Nikki Haley has done. But <a href=\"http://6abc.com/politics/confederate-flag-flying-over-south-carolina-state-house-sparks-controversy/793212/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">according to her spokesperson,</a> it&rsquo;s the Legislature, not the governor, who has the legal authority to alter the Confederate flag. <a href=\"http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t01c010.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Title 1 Chapter 10</a> of state law spells it out:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;The flag authorized to be flown at a designated location on the grounds of the Capitol Complex is the South Carolina Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag must be flown on a flagpole located at a point on the south side of the Confederate Soldier Monument, centered on the monument, 10 feet from the base of the monument at a height of 30 feet.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The provisions of this section may only be amended or repealed upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly.&quot;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The two-thirds vote applies to both permanent changes and temporary adjustments alike, according to the Democratic State Rep. <a href=\"http://www.scstatehouse.gov/member.php?code=1711363431\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">James E. Smith</a>, who doubts the law&rsquo;s constitutionality and who&rsquo;s been working on removing the flag since it was first moved to the grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Confederate flag has been displayed at its current location since <a href=\"http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess113_1999-2000/bills/4895.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">2000</a>, when the state passed the Heritage Act, a compromise that removed the flag from its place of sovereignty atop the capitol but allowed it to remain on the grounds. (The same piece of legislation also requires a two-third&#39;s&nbsp;vote by the General Assembly to make changes to Civil Rights monuments.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the flag can be lowered physically, no one we spoke to could recall a time -- be it Memorial Day or 9/11 -- when it wasn&rsquo;t flying at full-staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not a flag of sovereignty, it&rsquo;s a veterans&rsquo; battle flag. &hellip; Should that flag be on the dome, which it should, it would be lowered, but it&rsquo;s not,&quot; said Thomas Leland Summers, commander of the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who noted that the Confederate flag wasn&rsquo;t lowered to honor Civil War anniversaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith, a Democratic state lawmaker, agreed, but also said: &quot;That&rsquo;s beside the point. It shouldn&rsquo;t be flying anyway. If we were to lower it, it would give it the status of a sovereign flag, a status greater than it deserves. It should just be furled.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican State Rep. Norman &quot;Doug&quot; Brannon <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/state-rep.--remove-confederate-flag-468594243695\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">told</a> MSNBC on June 19 that he plans to sponsor a bill to remove the flag in the next legislative session. Most likely, Brannon won&rsquo;t be the only one, said <em>Statehouse Report</em> editor and publisher <a href=\"http://www.statehousereport.com/category/commentary/brack/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Andy Brack</a>. (Smith says he wants to do better than supermajority, he&rsquo;d like a unanimous vote.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These deaths &mdash; especially of one of their own (Democratic State Sen. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/pastor-and-state-senator-remembered-for-preaching-calls-for-justice/2015/06/18/793c0162-15cc-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Clementa Pinckney</a>) &mdash; might be the best chance in a decade to get the flag out of a place of prominence,&quot; Brack said. &quot;If the issue becomes a hot-button issue &mdash; so hot that legislators fear they&#39;ll lose their seats or face a challenger in the primaries for doing nothing &mdash; they could move promptly. They moved with the legislative equivalent of light speed after the death of Walter Scott in April and by June passed a bill to help pay for body cameras for police.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The atmosphere is changing it appears,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.furman.edu/academics/politicalscience/meet-our-faculty/Pages/Donald-L-Gordon.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Don Gordon</a>, political science professor at Furman University in Greenville. &quot;The attempts to remove the flag from visibility off Gervais Street in front of the Capital may gain traction. The pictures on the shooter&#39;s Last Rhodesian website and the clearly racist message some feel have moved the flag from a symbol of heritage to one of blatant hate, a shifting symbolism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A CNN reporter said, &quot;By law, (the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol) must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the general assembly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2000, South Carolina passed legislation that mandated the flag&rsquo;s location, a height of 30 feet, and a supermajority vote to make any changes. The Confederate flag has never been removed or, to our knowledge, lowered since it was raised on the Confederate Soldiers&rsquo; Monument on the capitol grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-21T10:59:54.346131", "ruling_date": "2015-06-21T17:23:46", "ruling_headline": "Flying Confederate battle flag in South Carolina at half-staff requires supermajority vote", "ruling_headline_slug": "flying-confederate-battle-flag-south-carolina-half", "ruling_link_text": "No one can remember it be lowered", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, June 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Interview with James E.
