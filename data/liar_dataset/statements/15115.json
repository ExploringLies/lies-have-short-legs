Angus King, I-Maine, have charged that a steel tariff would do more harm to U.S. allies like Canada, and American small businesses, than it would do to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Trump&rsquo;s announcement, King said he heard complaints from constituents who run steel-reliant small businesses. King said one business owner reported an 8 percent increase in steel costs, and another worried about cost increases on steel imported from a nearby Canadian partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump may have a point about unfair trade practices, King said, Beijing would hardly bear the brunt of an import tax on steel, given its relatively small U.S. market share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S,&quot; King said during a March 4 interview on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how much does China account for U.S. steel imports? We decided to mine for answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Transshipment of Chinese steel</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Measuring U.S. steel imports by country is not as&nbsp;straightforward as it might seem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American steel industry has argued that China has a backdoor to U.S. markets through a practice known as transshipment, whereby countries buy Chinese steel and modify it before exporting to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump drew attention to this practice during March 6 remarks at the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you talk China, I&rsquo;ve watched where the reporters have been writing&nbsp;2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that&rsquo;s not right. They transship all through other countries,&quot; Trump said. &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries, and it comes to us. And it&rsquo;s putting our steel mills out of business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we spoke to said there&rsquo;s no hard data on transshipment, which makes the scale of this practice difficult to gauge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted the Commerce Department was unable to quantify the problem in a recent <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/the_effect_of_imports_of_steel_on_the_national_security_-_with_redactions_-_20180111.pdf\">investigation</a>&nbsp;&mdash; known as a Section 232 report &mdash; that probed the effect of steel and aluminum imports on U.S. national security. The report said only that an &quot;unknown portion&quot; of Chinese steel is further processed in third-party countries before entering the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s at least fair to say that the president is making a strong claim without solid evidence to back that claim up,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alden added that the biggest targets of Trump&#39;s steel tariff would be the European Union, Japan, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Korea. (The White House is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-meet-metal-workers-as-aides-ready-tariff-rollout-1520517821\">reportedly</a> considering granting an exemption Canada and Mexico.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Except for Korea,&quot; he said, &quot;none of the others seems to be a transshipment concern.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said&nbsp;the amount of Chinese steel that enters the United States through transshipment is not enough to call into question the reliability of the Commerce Department&rsquo;s import data. He also pushed back on how Trump&nbsp;characterized&nbsp;transshipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;China sells raw and semi-finished steel&nbsp;to other countries, which then make more highly valued products. (But Trump&#39;s use of) the word &#39;transshipment&#39;&nbsp;implied that the same piece of metal arrives, for example, in Veracruz and then is shipped to Houston with no transformation,&quot;&nbsp;Hufbauer said.&nbsp;&quot;This is Trump&rsquo;s imagination.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s set the issue of transshipment to one side and focus on the steel products the Trump administration has eyed for tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the only steel imports subject to Trump&#39;s proposed tariffs are those which have been identified by the Commerce Department.&nbsp;The department measures U.S. steel imports in two ways:&nbsp;quantity&nbsp;and U.S. dollar value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under each yardstick, China&rsquo;s share is relatively small.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">China&#39;s share of U.S. steel imports</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of quantity, China accounts for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, according to 2017 data. That&rsquo;s far behind traditional U.S. allies like Canada (roughly 18 percent), the European Union (about 21 percent) and South Korea (nearly 10 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expressed another way, the United States imported 740,126 tons of steel from China last year, compared to nearly 5.7 million tons from Canada and just over 5 million tons from European Union countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s share is slightly larger in terms of dollar value, but still relatively small. The United States imported just shy of $1 billion in&nbsp;Chinese steel in 2017, or 3.35 percent of the United States&rsquo; nearly $30 billion annual steel import market, according to Commerce Department <a href=\"https://enforcement.trade.gov/steel/license/SMP/Census/Annual/gdesc52/M$Sum_ALL_ALL_9Y.htm\">data</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aide to King pointed us to an <a href=\"https://piie.com/experts/peterson-perspectives/trade-talks-episode-3-nerves-steel-waiting-trumps-trade-war\">interview</a> with Bown, of the Peterson Institute, from September 2017, in which Bown said 4 percent of U.S. imports of steel come from China. But its proportion of U.S. steel imports, relative to other countries, has shrunk since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, he wasn&rsquo;t too far off China&rsquo;s 3.35 percent market share in 2017, in terms of dollar value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts largely backed up his broader point about the limited impact of steel tariffs on China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The numbers show that the tariffs will hurt trading partners &mdash; which are allies &mdash; much more than China,&quot; said Mac Destler, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg in Beijing, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/trump-is-said-to-delay-decision-on-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs\">wrote</a> that China&rsquo;s total exports of steel and aluminum are equal to about 0.5 percent of GDP, with most of that from steel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Relative to fears from Trump&rsquo;s campaign trail rhetoric, in which he threatened an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on all imports from China, these measures are extremely limited,&quot; Orlik wrote of Trump&rsquo;s proposed tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>King said, &quot;China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are different ways to measure U.S. steel imports by country. In terms of dollar value, Chinese steel made up 3.35 percent of the United States&rsquo; nearly $30 billion annual steel import market in 2017. But in terms of quantity, China accounted for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>King&rsquo;s claim tracks closely to one of two measures. But in either case, King does not stray too far from the Commerce Department&rsquo;s 2017 data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-07T13:07:10.430447", "ruling_date": "2018-03-08T09:30:00", "ruling_headline": "How much steel does the U.S. import from China?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-much-steel-does-us-import-china", "ruling_link_text": "Nuts and bolts of trade data", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sen.
