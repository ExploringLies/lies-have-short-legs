We revisted his position in an<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-disavows-support-path-citizenship/\"> item published March 6, 2015</a>, with a new ruling of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-disavows-support-path-citizenship/\">Full Flop</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The left-wing group <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Media Matters for America</u></a> cried flip-flop after Gov. Scott Walker bluntly told ABC News he opposed &quot;amnesty&quot; for illegal immigrants living in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker, the group said in <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/02/01/the-scott-walker-immigration-shift-abc-news-ign/202370\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>blog post</u></a>, previously had supported a pathway to citizenship advocated by lawmakers in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">garnering plenty of attention amid a crowded field of potential 2016 GOP presidential candidates</a>, let&rsquo;s put this one to the Flip-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, we have visited Walker&rsquo;s statements on immigration before, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/aug/04/words-audience-matter-politically-sensitive-immigr/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>notably in August 2013</u></a>, when we examined how Republicans were framing the issue in the wake of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s re-election win with strong support from Hispanics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, Walker has been hard to pin down on the question, and has made seemingly contradictory statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we were struck by Walker&rsquo;s direct language and tone Feb. 1, 2015 in the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-gov-scott-walker/story?id=28605893&amp;singlePage=true\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>&quot;This Week&quot; interview with ABC&rsquo;s Martha Raddatz</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Raddatz: &quot;We know you want to fix the border and fix the immigration system, but what would you do about the 11 million undocumented who are still here?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Walker: &quot;I think for sure, we need to secure the border. I think we need to enforce the legal system. I&#39;m not for amnesty&hellip;&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making the comments, did Walker change his position?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some key past statements he&rsquo;s made, all in 2013:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- At a February 2013 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/scott-walker-supports-path-to-citizenship-87960.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>national conference hosted by Politico</u></a>, Walker said fixing the <em>legal</em> immigration system should come first, but said the next step is we &quot;gotta embrace&quot; a &quot;legal pathway&quot; for those here unlawfully. He did not elaborate on what he meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- In a July 2013 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/07/03/scott-walker-backs-path-to-citizenship-increased-immigration/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>interview with Wausau (Wis.) Daily Herald</u></a> staffers, Walker said &quot;it makes sense&quot; that people could not only stay here but get citizenship with the right mix of penalties and waiting periods and other requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- In 2013 and later, Walker didn&rsquo;t endorse any specific bill in Congress that would have allowed illegal immigrants to stay here. But at the Politico conference, he didn&rsquo;t dismiss legislative action if some &quot;nuances&quot; were addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- At that conference he flatly opposed deporting people who are here unlawfully, saying &quot;you&rsquo;ve got to find a way to make it legally possible for people moving forward.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after Walker&rsquo;s reported comments sympathetic to some kind of path to citizenship made headlines, he started to walk back the idea he had supported such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His spokesman told us in August 2013 that Walker had endorsed no specific policy or bill. And Walker said in November 2013 on MSNBC&rsquo;s Morning Joe that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mJB8WTGows\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>he had not meant to back a pathway</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s revisit the recent ABC interview in more depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that interview, Walker also said, &quot;I&rsquo;m not an advocate of the plans that have been pushed here in Washington&quot; to allow those here to remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s arguably more dismissive than he&rsquo;s been before. But Walker added that he would roll out a plan of his own to address the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he tossed in what sounded like softening remarks, saying &quot;we&rsquo;ve got to have a healthy balance. We&rsquo;re a country both of immigrants and of laws. We can&rsquo;t ignore the laws in this country, can&#39;t ignore the people who come in, whether it&rsquo;s from Mexico or Central America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Walker told Raddatz he was not advocating deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented residents in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He summed up his position this way: &quot;I am saying in the end, we need to enforce the laws in the United States, and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country, and that does not mean amnesty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What to make of Walker&rsquo;s remarks?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson said they were consistent with his past comments on what to do with those living here illegally. Walker does not consider the penalty-laden pathway to legal status that he endorsed in 2013 &quot;amnesty,&quot; and he&rsquo;s not advocating amnesty now, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For help, we turned to two groups advocating on this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An advocate with a group that backs a path to citizenship agreed Walker&rsquo;s comments were vague, but detected a change in his words and actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America&rsquo;s Voice, noted Walker said nothing in the spirit of his 2013 comments on finding a way, eventually, to allow people to stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His goal &quot;is to be as vague as possible so that he can court hard-right anti-immigrant voters while remaining viable in the general election,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tramonte said Walker has indirectly backed deportations by joining a lawsuit challenging President Obama&rsquo;s authority to issue a November 2014 executive order on immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That order <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-among-17-states-suing-over-obama-immigration-order-b99402466z1-284654021.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>protected from deportation</u></a> some 4.1 million parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, and hundreds of thousands more young people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also spoke with Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). The group is a leading critic of legalizing the status of people who jumped the line to get in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s description of his views as anti-amnesty doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean much, Mehlman said. Republicans, even if they want to find a way to let illegal immigrants remain here, reject the &quot;amnesty&quot; label for political reasons, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the substance of Walker&rsquo;s remarks, Mehlman said that, coming in such a brief exchange, Walker&rsquo;s comments were too cryptic to really evaluate his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mehlman&rsquo;s view: Walker really hasn&rsquo;t backed away from his 2013 statements, so in they eyes of FAIR, he still supports what some might term amnesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Politicians from both parties who support granting legal status to millions of illegal aliens go to great pains to define what they support as something other than amnesty,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t see a Full Flop by Walker here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker didn&rsquo;t directly disavow his 2013 remarks -- or repeat them for that matter. And the truth is that we don&rsquo;t really know whether he has a completely new position, because he wasn&rsquo;t asked to clarify his views in detail. All we know is he&rsquo;s not going to call his plan &quot;amnesty&quot; when it comes out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do see inconsistencies in Walker&rsquo;s framing of his views and the tone of his remarks as he begins to court conservative GOP primary voters -- including leaving a tough-sounding impression about handling illegal immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the meter, inconsistent statements or a partial change of position earn a Half Flip. That fits here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-04T12:00:30.743034", "ruling_date": "2015-02-04T12:09:12", "ruling_headline": "Did Scott Walker flip-flop on a immigration and a pathway to citizenship?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-scott-walker-flip-flop-pathway-citizenship", "ruling_link_text": "For some sort of pathway, or not?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News This Week, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-gov-scott-walker/story?id=28605893&amp;singlePage=true\">Scott Walker interview</a>, Feb. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Lynn Tramonte, deputy director, America&rsquo;s Voice, Feb. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Ira Mehlman, spokesman, Federation for American Immigration Reform, Feb. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Tom Evenson, Walker campaign spokesman, Feb. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories as noted</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}, "statement": "<p>On the status of illegal immigrants</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2015-02-01", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
