Asked about the matter, he said:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;I probably spend over 50 percent of my time on national security issues &hellip;.This had nothing to do with convenience, this was purely about national security.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;The government has never paid for any of my personal travel.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;My staff wanted to make sure that I constantly had access to secure communication&quot; and the use of a jet for his honeymoon &quot;was one of the things we explored. So, they put in a request to consider the use of an aircraft ... and ultimately we withdrew the request. We found a way of dealing with other secure communication.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Asked whether the jet was a staff request, not his personal request, Mnuchin said: &quot;Again, I discussed with the staff a bunch of alternatives &hellip; one of the things they suggested, I agreed that they would look into it, OK? We looked into other things, as well. When we found alternative uses, we withdrew the request.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Mnuchin doesn&rsquo;t deny requesting the jet, though he suggests it was out of concern for national security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of Sept. 14, 2017, the day after the ABC story, the Treasury Department&rsquo;s inspector general&rsquo;s office was looking at all requests for, and use of, government aircraft by Mnuchin, that office <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mnuchin-honeymoon-aircraft-20170914-htmlstory.html\">told</a> <a href=\"http://wtop.com/government/2017/09/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-requested-government-jet-for-european-honeymoon/\">reporters</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mnuchin-honeymoon-aircraft-20170914-htmlstory.html\">The inquiry</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/treasury-inspector-general-to-review-mnuchin-flight-to-ft-knox/2017/08/31/d9e122d4-8eb2-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html?utm_term=.359dadf490cc\">was launched</a> after Mnuchin and his wife took a trip to Kentucky just ahead of the August 2017 solar eclipse. Mnuchin held an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,&nbsp;and visited Fort Knox, where he and Linton viewed the eclipse near the path of totality, the Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mnuchin-honeymoon-aircraft-20170914-htmlstory.html\">reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury officials defended that visit as official government travel and said Mnuchin would reimburse the government for bringing his wife along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan says Mnuchin &quot;wants to use a government jet that costs $25,000 per hour for his honeymoon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan&rsquo;s use of <em>wants</em> wrongly suggests it is a pending request, and the news report he cites said the jet <em>could</em> cost $25,000 an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But essentially Pocan is on target: Mnuchin put in a request for a government plane to take him and his wife to their honeymoon destinations, though he did not use one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Pocan&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p> div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-18T14:11:28.739076", "ruling_date":
