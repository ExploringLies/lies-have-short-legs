Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., made a serious charge &nbsp;on the second night of the Democratic National Convention about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump making money off of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowley, who lost a cousin that day, (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/09/hillary-clinton/shes-been-active-on-issues-for-911-workers/\">accurately</a>) painted Hillary Clinton as someone who was there for the city and its first-responders. Trump, however, &quot;saw a payday for his empire,&quot; Crowley said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Where was Donald Trump in the days and months and the years after 9/11? He didn&rsquo;t stand at the pile, he didn&rsquo;t lobby Congress for help, he didn&rsquo;t fight for the first responders,&quot; he said. &quot;Nope, he cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover &mdash; even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Trump, a New Yorker, take taxpayer-funded money earmarked for small businesses and for losses he said he didn&rsquo;t even suffer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for Crowley referred us to a 2006 <em>New York Daily News </em><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/feds-gave-donald-quick-bundle-titans-9-11-funds-set-small-biz-article-1.558429\">investigation</a>. <em>The Daily News</em> found that Trump did receive $150,000 for the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-trump-40-wall-street/\">Trump Building</a>, which is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/World+Trade+Center,+New+York,+NY/40+Wall+Street+-+The+Trump+Building,+40+Wall+St,+New+York,+NY+10005/@40.7092519,-74.016697,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a19881b83fb:0x979b0a4fe0492ce6!2m2!1d-74.0131196!2d40.7118011!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a1700286efb:0x5358bf9fda32dea1!2m2!1d-74.0097399!2d40.7069547\">less than a mile</a> away from the World Trade Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Crowley&rsquo;s charge is misleading as it suggests Trump took advantage of the program, when his property at 40 Wall Street did meet the criteria for the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the 9/11 business recovery grant program run by the Empire State Development, New York&rsquo;s economic development agency, firms were <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/onecpd/assets/File/CDBG-DR-Case-Study-9-11-Business-Recovery-Grants-NYC.pdf\">eligible</a> if they employed 500 employees or less, had been physically or economically damaged by the attacks, and located on or south of 14th Street in Lower Manhattan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <em>Daily News</em>, Trump&rsquo;s &quot;grant application describes the corporation through which Trump owns that building as having 28 employees and $26.8 million in annual revenues.&quot; (The newspaper notes that the federal definition of a small business is $6 million.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s was among <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/19/nyregion/9-11-small-business-grants-exceed-approved-financing.html\">over 14,000 companies</a> that received grants totalling $530 million. That includes other firms like the Rockefeller Group, Ford Motors, Dell Inc., Morgan Stanley and the Bank of China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was the Trump Building impacted by the 9/11? According to Trump, no, though he was likely referring to physical damages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have a lot of property down there,&quot; he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYXygIcIJ6I\">told</a> a German TV reporter after the attack. &quot;But it wasn&rsquo;t, fortunately, affected by what happened to the World Trade Center.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how Trump <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/us/politics/jerrold-nadler-donald-trump-sept-11.html\">responded</a> when the <em>New York Times </em>asked him about the grant in May 2016:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;The company received this small amount of money after qualifying, given the limited number of employees working at the property. For many months, I allowed people to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building. I was happy to do it and to this day I am still being thanked for the many people I helped. The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowley said Trump &quot;cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover &mdash; even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump did receive a grant for his building at 40 Wall Street, which was less than a mile away from the Trade Center, but the property was eligible under the grant criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also did say in 2001 that his properties were not affected by the attack, although he likely meant physically. The grant also provided compensation for economic losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Crowley&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cd779146-3dbe-4084-b84f-438f74cf1b82\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cd779146-3dbe-4084-b84f-438f74cf1b82</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-26T21:49:03.733894", "ruling_date": "2016-07-27T00:14:16", "ruling_headline": "Did Donald Trump 'cash in' $150,000 after 9/11?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-donald-trump-cash-federal-funds-days-after-911", "ruling_link_text": "Trump's building was eligible for the $$", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Courtney Gidner, spokeswoman for Joseph Crowley, July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Daily News</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/feds-gave-donald-quick-bundle-titans-9-11-funds-set-small-biz-article-1.558429\">FEDS GAVE DONALD A QUICK BUNDLE.
