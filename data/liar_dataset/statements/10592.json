It showed that Rhode Island had the lowest percentage of government employees in New England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the chart, a total of 59,800, or 11.6 percent, of the state&rsquo;s 514,100 jobs are in the public sector. New Hampshire was second lowest, with 12.5 percent, followed by Massachusetts (13.1 percent), Connecticut (13.3 percent), Maine (15 percent) and Vermont (16.3 percent). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those are just the New England numbers. Where does Rhode Island rank nationally in percentage of public employees?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got those figures when we reached out to the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. Spokesman Michael J. Healey provided us with calculations from its labor market information division.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donna Murray, assistant director of the division, compared the number of government jobs -- including federal workers and educators -- to the number of non-farm jobs in every state and determined what percentage the public-sector jobs made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those calculations indicated that as of December 2014, the state had a total of 59,700 government jobs, which accounted for 12.5 percent of the state&rsquo;s 478,900 total positions. Of the state&rsquo;s public sector jobs, 10,500 are federal, Murray said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ties Rhode Island with Nevada as the states with the second lowest percentage of public employees in the nation. Pennsylvania was the sole state with a lower percentage, at 12.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, Wyoming had the highest percentage of public employees at 24.2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationally, government jobs make up an average of 15.9 percent of total non-farm jobs, according to the department&rsquo;s calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered how Rhode Island compares when federal jobs are excluded, and only state and local workers are counted, since those are the jobs that impact state and municipal budgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Governing, a non-partisan magazine and website that tracks politics, policy and management for state and local government leaders. It published its own analysis, entitled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.governing.com/gov-data/public-workforce-salaries/states-most-government-workers-public-employees-by-job-type.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>States With Most Government Employees: Per Capita Rates By Job Type</u></a>&quot;. (The governor&rsquo;s office also referred us to this analysis.) The Governing analysis was published last March, using 2012 numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike Maciag, the data editor at Governing, agreed to run more current numbers for us to determine how Rhode Island&rsquo;s rate of state and local public employees compares with rates of other states and the national average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maciag used 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll for his calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the analysis, Rhode Island had 458 state and local employees -- including teachers -- per 10,000 residents, he said. This placed the Ocean State as the state with the seventh-lowest number of public employees in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wyoming had the most public employees per 10,000 -- 866. Nevada had the least -- 368 . The national average was 538.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, according to Healey, Rhode Island had a total of 16,100 state employees as of December 2014. That includes 10,805 in state government, 4,612 in higher education, and 683 in the judiciary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governor Raimondo said that Rhode Island was &quot;well below average&quot; in the number of public employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information provided to us by the governor&rsquo;s office and the state Department of Labor and Training support that claim, as does an analysis done by Governing, &nbsp;the non-partisan magazine and website</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
