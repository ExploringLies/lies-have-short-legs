Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Trump first deployed a version of this line after Bush accused him of getting his foreign policy knowledge &quot;from the shows,&quot; but it was garbled as the two went back and forth in a flared exchange. Later, Trump circled back to make the same point with better clarity during a question directed only to him, again trying to paint Bush as a failed candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Even if the statistic fits with the storyline &ndash; that Bush&rsquo;s well-heeled campaign and super PAC went all out in New Hampshire, and Trump doesn&rsquo;t need to spend money to get attention &ndash; the gap seemed extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">PolitiFact New Hampshire<strong> </strong>knew straight away his recollection of the election results was a bit off, so we decided to investigate whether it could be true that Trump tallied more than three times as many votes as Bush, while spending less than one-tenth what the governor did.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\"><strong>The results</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">First, we&rsquo;ll take on the second half of Trump&rsquo;s statement: Bush &quot;came in five, and I came in No. 1.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">We only needed to look at <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/new-hampshire\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the election results</u></a> to know Trump was right about his position -- he won the Republican primary on Feb. 9 with 100,406 votes -- &nbsp;but wrong about Bush&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">With 11 percent of the vote (31,310), Bush came in fourth place, not fifth. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was the one who actually came in fifth &ndash; although the margin was very close. The difference between Bush and Rubio was 1,278 votes, or about 0.4 percent of the total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">We reached out to Trump&rsquo;s campaign and never heard back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\"><strong>The spending</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Trump said Bush spent $44 million in New Hampshire, but made no mention of super PACs spending money. We won&rsquo;t hold that wording against Trump, especially since the money was spent on Bush&rsquo;s behalf, and Bush himself raised money for his PAC before he was an official candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Various news agencies have published analyses of the money that campaigns and related super PACs have spent on ads in New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\"><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/02/10/466304477/what-does-spending-over-1-000-per-vote-in-n-h-get-you\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>NPR</u></a>, for one, looked at NBC-SMG Delta and Associated Press data through Feb. 3 to consider each candidate&rsquo;s return on his or her New Hampshire TV ad spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Their data, which doesn&rsquo;t include the final few days before the primary, found that Bush and super PACs backing him spent the most per-vote by far: $4.5 million from his campaign and $29.5 million from super PACs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">With about 31,000 voters supporting him, that meant a per-vote cost of more than $1,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Trump, according to the same analysis, spent $3.1 million, all of which came from his campaign and none from a super PAC. With slightly more than 100,000 votes, that&rsquo;s $31 per vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">To refocus on Trump&rsquo;s statement, the total spent for each candidate per NPR&rsquo;s analysis was: Trump $3.1 million; Bush, $34 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">By that measure, Trump appears to be accurate on his own numbers but exaggerating Bush&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">A secondary analysis by Morning Consult, which was published the morning of the primary, accounts for the last few days before voting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">It had each candidate&rsquo;s ad spending slightly higher in line with the additional time. By this time, Bush was at $36.1 million and Trump was at $3.7 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">So Trump&rsquo;s estimate for himself was slightly low, while his account for Bush was still exaggerated by about $8 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">To put that spending in perspective, we took a look at the numbers for the campaigns that fell in after Bush. Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton weren&rsquo;t even close, spending $18.5 million, $15.2 million, $12.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively, according to <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/briefs/campaigns-brief-how-to-watch-new-hampshire/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the Morning Consult analysis</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">So whether Trump had said $34 million or $44 million, he was pointing out a radically high number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Trump said: &quot;In New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb Bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Bush came in fourth, not fifth, and his campaign and the PACs supporting him spent about $36 million, not $44 million. But it was still the most of any candidate. Trump did finish in first but&nbsp;spent closer to $4 million, not $3 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Trump is slightly off in three out of the four claims, but his larger point about spending and campaign effectiveness in New Hampshire hold true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">We can&rsquo;t say whether Trump was intentionally exaggerating or not. Either way, we rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-18T20:33:51.820617", "ruling_date": "2016-02-18T20:29:52", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump compares his spending and New Hampshire primary results to Jeb Bush", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-compares-his-spending-and-new-hampshi", "ruling_link_text": "Well, not exactly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/new-hampshire\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New Hampshire&rsquo;s Presidential Primaries Results</u></a>, Feb. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">NPR, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/02/10/466304477/what-does-spending-over-1-000-per-vote-in-n-h-get-you\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>What Does Spending Over $1,000 Per Vote In N.H.
