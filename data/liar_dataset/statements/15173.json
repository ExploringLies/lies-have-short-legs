Conrad of Wisconsin Dells. He was charged in February 2015 with felony repeated sexual assault of the same child, according to <a href=\"https://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetails.do;jsessionid=A0B2DEB6C2806719DC9DCC9C64FCA9CE.render6?caseNo=2015CF000056&amp;countyNo=56&amp;cacheId=84CB806D928E17042B8C60B6BF0A747C&amp;recordCount=24&amp;offset=8&amp;mode=details&amp;submit=View+Case+Details\">online court records</a>. The incidents occurred over roughly a two-year period starting when Conrad was 17 and the victim was 14. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conrad pleaded no contest to the charge and Screnock sentenced him to five years of probation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a written statement, the girl told Screnock before the sentencing that she agreed with the probation sentence and said: &quot;I knew what I was doing. I was a willing participant.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn important point to note is that the prosecutor and the defense attorney agreed with the probation recommendation of the probation department, &nbsp;&nbsp;although judges are not bound by such recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also note that the use of the &quot;predator&quot; in the ad can be understood as an older person preying on a younger person, but this was not a case involving a violent sex offender, according to state law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s correct to say Screnock didn&rsquo;t sentence Conrad to any &quot;time&quot; -- as in, time behind bars -- though Conrad was put on probation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rapist claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other case involved Aldo Eder Ruiz-Velazquez of Sauk City. He was initially charged in March 2016 with third-degree sexual assault, a felony that carries a maximum prison term of 10 years; and with sex with a child age 16 or older, a misdemeanor, according to <a href=\"https://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetails.do;jsessionid=A0B2DEB6C2806719DC9DCC9C64FCA9CE.render6?caseNo=2016CF000092&amp;countyNo=56&amp;cacheId=0B881CFB520372ADA6D38997AF0D4DB5&amp;recordCount=1&amp;offset=0&amp;mode=details&amp;submit=View+Case+Details\">online court records</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a plea bargain, Ruiz-Velazquez, who was 24 at the time he was charged, pleaded no contest to fourth-degree sexual assault of a child, a misdemeanor, according to <a href=\"https://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetails.do;jsessionid=A0B2DEB6C2806719DC9DCC9C64FCA9CE.render6?caseNo=2016CF000092&amp;countyNo=56&amp;cacheId=0B881CFB520372ADA6D38997AF0D4DB5&amp;recordCount=1&amp;offset=0&amp;mode=details&amp;submit=View+Case+Details\">online court records</a>. That charge is defined as having sexual contact with a person without the consent of that person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Screnock sentenced Ruiz-Velazquez to two years of probation, including eight months in jail, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/19/rebecca-dallet-rips-michael-screnock-sentences-experience-wisconsin-supreme-court-ad/437320002/\">nearly the maximum</a> time of nine months in jail allowed on the reduced charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a Baraboo News-Republic <a href=\"http://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/article_fe105109-852f-5d34-97a8-47ce3c17cef7.html\">news article</a>, two underage females said Ruiz-Velazquez bought alcohol for them and took them to a house where they drank together. One of the girls, who was 16, told police that when she went to the bathroom, Ruiz-Velazquez followed her inside and locked the door and had sex with her, even though she repeatedly told him no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said the prosecutor agreed to reduce the felony to the misdemeanor in exchange for Ruiz-Velazquez pleading no contest to that charge. The prosecutor and the defense attorney recommended the sentence that Screnock ultimately imposed, the article said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was unclear whether the victim would have been willing to testify in a trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the news article, the prosecutor said the sentence balanced the victim&rsquo;s wishes with the needs of society. Screnock, the article said, said that while the charge was serious, the need to protect the public was minimal because Ruiz-Velazquez did not have a history of prior criminal activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the sentence in this case was eight months, but that was nearly the maximum allowed by law under the plea bargain that had been made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dallet says Screnock &quot;let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first case, an older male teen repeatedly had sex with a younger female teen, who told authorities the relationship was consensual. He was sentenced to five years of probation, but no time behind bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second case, a 16-year-old said a 24-year-old man forced her to have intercourse and he was sentenced two years of probation, including eight months in jail, after pleading no contest to a reduced sexual assault charge. The maximum possible jail sentence for the misdemeanor, the result of a plea bargain, was nine months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Dallet&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure
