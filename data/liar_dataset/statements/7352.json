According to the <a href=\"http://election.dos.state.fl.us/campaign-finance/cam-finance-reporting.shtml\">Florida Department of State</a>, a &quot;person&quot; in campaign finance terms is defined broadly to include &quot;an individual or a corporation, association, firm, partnership, joint venture, joint stock company, club, organization, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate or other combination of individuals having collective capacity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo each &quot;person&quot; can contribute $500 for a primary and $500 for a general election, or $1,000 total. The same person can also contribute another $1,000 for a business they own. Or if they own 10 businesses, they can contribute an additional $10,000. And so on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWeatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy directed us to a <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/legismgt/Limits_to_Candidates_2011-2012.pdf\">breakdown of campaign limits</a>&nbsp;across states by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Duffy said Florida is actually tied for the second-lowest limit, with Maine being the state with the lowest limit ($350).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s not <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzR_9M-1WtJTTHZFLVFKMkRTdFU/edit?usp=sharing\">a simple apples-to-apples comparison</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida&rsquo;s $500 limit -- or $1,000 if you include the primary and general election -- is the same for all state races (House, Senate, Cabinet and governor), but limits in other states vary according to the race. In Connecticut, for instance, individual donations max out at $3,500 per election for gubernatorial candidates (more than Florida), $1,000 for state Senate races (the same) and $250 for state House races (and less).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome states have different contribution limits for election years and non-election years. And instead of counting donations for each election, like Florida, some states strictly look at donation tallies per calendar year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPoint being, it&rsquo;s pretty complicated. So we went to the experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNCSL senior fellow Jennie Bowser provided us a list of 12 states that have the same or lower contribution limits as Florida in certain situations. (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and Wisconsin).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few examples, from the NCSL:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t* Candidates for Legislature in <strong>Delaware</strong> can receive a total of $600 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).<br />\r\n\t* Candidates for Legislature in<strong> Montana</strong> can receive a total of $320 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).<br />\r\n\t* Candidates for Legislature in <strong>Colorado</strong> can receive a total of $400 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn each case, that compares to $1,000 in Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWeatherford&rsquo;s point would be closer to accurate if he were talking solely about contributions to a candidate for governor, Bowser said. Alaska&rsquo;s limit is the same as Florida&rsquo;s as long as the total amount is given in two separate contributions, each in a different calendar year. Arizona&rsquo;s $872 limit is the lowest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\tWeatherford claimed Florida&rsquo;s direct campaign contribution limit is the second-lowest limit in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida&rsquo;s limit ($500 per election) is low compared to some states, though it&rsquo;s not that low when you consider that people can make multiple contributions using business entities. But even still, Weatherford errs in trying to make a sweeping comparison because states don&rsquo;t have an across-the-board limit. We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-08T10:40:53.439866", "ruling_date": "2013-02-08T13:09:44", "ruling_headline": "Will Weatherford says Florida's campaign contribution limit is nation's second-lowest", "ruling_headline_slug": "will-weatherford-says-floridas-campaign-contributi", "ruling_link_text": "Not so $imple", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://thefloridachannel.org/video/13013-associated-press-legislative-planning-session-with-senate-president-don-gaetz-house-speaker-will-weatherford/\">Will Weatherford&rsquo;s remarks</a>&nbsp;at Associated Press pre-session briefing, Jan. 30, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Conference of State Legislatures, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjR_9M-1WtJTdDNVX3N3bTVtclNVZmF0WnE1ekNjYUE&amp;usp=sharing\">chart of median state contribution limits,</a>&nbsp;accessed Jan. 31, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Conference of State Legislatures, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzR_9M-1WtJTTHZFLVFKMkRTdFU/edit?usp=sharing\">list of each state&rsquo;s campaign contrbution rules</a>, accessed Jan. 31, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Ryan Duffy, Florida House spokesman, Jan. 31, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Jennie Bowser, National Conference of State Legislatures senior fellow, Jan. 31, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIntegrity Florida report, &quot;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzR_9M-1WtJTNnVKTllIVGtLQlk/edit\">Florida&rsquo;s broken campaign finance system</a>,&quot; Jan. 16, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Department of State, <a href=\"http://election.dos.state.fl.us/campaign-finance/cam-finance-reporting.shtml\">&quot;About campaign finance reporting</a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 6, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Chris Cate, Florida Department of State, Feb. 7, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTampa Bay Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/political-committees-prove-funding-boon-for-state-gop-lawmakers/1259656\">Political committees prove funding boon for state GOP lawmakers</a>,&quot; Nov. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTampa Bay Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/florida-rep-chris-dorworths-big-donors-fund-lavish-political-operation/1251970\">Florida Rep.
