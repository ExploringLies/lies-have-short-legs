So, the University of South Florida graduate student and Republican activist is trying to use her conservative message to stand out from the pack.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring a recent interview with an editorial writer and reporter from the <em>Times</em>, O&rsquo;Connor said she brings a different perspective to Pasco&rsquo;s problems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne problem? Excessive spending, she said, casting Pasco County&rsquo;s budget in stark terms.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Our budget has doubled in the past three years,&quot; she said, echoing a claim she made at a recent candidate forum. &quot;I think we need to prioritize spending.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe claim prompted a double take. Here&rsquo;s what happened next:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEditorial writer C.T. Bowen: &quot;I&rsquo;ve got to back you up. The budget&rsquo;s doubled the last three years?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tO&rsquo;Connor: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBowen: &quot;How&rsquo;s that possible?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tO&rsquo;Connor: &quot;It&rsquo;s possible. I talked to Mr. Nurrenbrock (the county&rsquo;s longtime budget chief). You can double-check it with him. It has. In the past three years. It&rsquo;s now over $1 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tReporter Lee Logan: &quot;Um, there must be&hellip; I guess&hellip; That&rsquo;s not the general revenue portion of the budget?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tO&rsquo;Connor: &quot;That&rsquo;s the total budget.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tClearly there&rsquo;s something funky going on here.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we called budget chief Mike Nurrenbrock. He pointed us to the budget&rsquo;s final summary page. Sure enough, under &quot;total county budget,&quot; it includes $554 million for Fiscal Year 2011, $1.1 billion for Fiscal Year 2012, and $1.1 billion for the proposed budget that begins Oct. 1.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Nurrenbrock explained that line doesn&rsquo;t exactly compare apples to apples. Here&rsquo;s the key: the FY2011 figure lists what was actually spent that year. The next two numbers are the total budget, even though officials know a good chunk of the money won&rsquo;t be spent that year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNurrenbrock said that &quot;dramatic difference&quot; is money that is rolled from each year to the next. That includes reserves, large capital projects and money for bond issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;There&rsquo;s a major portion of our budget that just goes forward the next year, pretty much every year,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome high-profile examples: The county has $32 million in general fund reserves in case a major storm hits, and there is a similar $5 million pot in the municipal service fund. About $11.5 million in tourism taxes have been collecting for 20 years, and commissioners recently earmarked the money for a sports complex in Wesley Chapel.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is a $7 million fund for economic development incentives or infrastructure. And there&rsquo;s a total of $93 million in transportation impact fees. Those are set aside for specific projects that simply haven&rsquo;t gone out to bid. That figure includes about $40 million for the long-stalled Ridge Road extension.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd so on.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNurrenbrock said it&rsquo;s more accurate to compare the total spending plans from each year. Here are the last five bottom-line budgets: $980 million (FY09), $949 million (FY10), $1.03 billion (FY11), $1.09 billion (FY 12), and next year&rsquo;s proposed $1.1 billion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tO&rsquo;Connor acknowledged the mistake. She said it stems from trying to make sense of a complex, 292-page spending plan. Challengers are often at a disadvantage to incumbents regarding budgetary details, because sitting commissioners are supposed to know how the county&rsquo;s money is spent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;As candidates, it&rsquo;s very difficult to look at that budget and come up with specific things to cut,&quot; she said. &quot;When you try to get insight with the county administration, they&rsquo;re not the easiest to work with.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFair enough. Also, O&rsquo;Connor isn&rsquo;t the only candidate to make a wild claim about Pasco&rsquo;s spending. District 3 hopeful Kathryn Starkey recently retracted a line about reining in &quot;runaway local government spending&quot; that was on her campaign flier. In an interview, she said, &quot;All in all, I think our county government has done a good job of being fiscally conservative in a tough time.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s claim about a ballooning county budget is shocking &mdash; especially as property tax collections have shriveled in the past several years. The claim is also incorrect. O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s statement earns a False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-20T16:59:33.407990", "ruling_date": "2012-07-22T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rachel O'Connor says Pasco County's budget has doubled in three years", "ruling_headline_slug": "rachel-oconnor-says-pascos-budget-has-doubled-thre", "ruling_link_text": "Local candidate misreads the numbers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPasco County <a href=\"http://pascocountyfl.net/index.aspx?NID=319\">Fiscal Year 2013 budget</a>, accessed July 20<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPasco County <a href=\"http://pascocountyfl.net/index.aspx?NID=319\">Capital Improvement Plan FY 13-17</a>, accessed July 20<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Pasco County Commission candidate Rachel O&rsquo;Connor, July 12 and 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Pasco County budget chief Mike Nurrenbrock, July 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Pasco County Commission candidate Kathryn Starkey, July 16, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Rachel", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1935, "last_name": "O'Connor", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "rachel-oconnor", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact_mugs_oconnor.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1935/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe Pasco County budget &quot;has doubled in the past three years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2012-07-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 171, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/171/", "subject": "County Budget", "subject_slug": "county-budget", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
