Gen. Michael Flynn</a>, who became President Donald Trump&rsquo;s short-lived national security adviser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore made his comments during a campaign stop to meet with members of the pro-gun group BamaCarry Inc. There, reporter Jeff Stein of the website Vox.com <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/15/16151182/alabama-senate-roy-moore\">asked</a> him, &quot;Some right-wing conservatives think Sharia law is a danger to America --&nbsp;do you?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore responded, &quot;There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don&rsquo;t know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stein pressed Moore to name the communities under Sharia law. He responded, &quot;Well, there&rsquo;s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the interview, Stein tried again, asking Moore to be specific and name which communities he was referring to. Moore said, &quot;I was informed that there were. But if they&rsquo;re not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Sharia law incorporates Muslim law into the law. That&rsquo;s not what we do. We do not punish people according to the Christian precepts of our faith -- so there&rsquo;s a difference.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So are there really entire communities that ignore U.S. law and operate instead under Sharia law?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found zero evidence of it. (We did not hear back from the Moore campaign.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office of the Illinois attorney general told PolitiFact that there are &quot;no communities under Sharia law&quot; in the state. Experts were equally dubious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Seriously, I&#39;ve never heard of any such thing,&quot; said Nathan J. Brown, director of George Washington University&rsquo;s Institute for Middle East Studies and a specialist on the rule of law in the Arab world. &quot;I suspect the only accurate part of his statement is when he confesses, &lsquo;I don&#39;t know.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na&lsquo;im, an Emory University law professor, was equally skeptical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have not seen evidence of entire communities being run by Sharia law anywhere in the United States,&quot; An-Na&lsquo;im said. In fact, &quot;it is legally impossible for any community anywhere in the United States to be &lsquo;under Sharia law&rsquo; simply because for that to happen, Sharia law must be enacted as the law of the state, and that is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the First Amendment &quot;allows for accommodation but not establishment,&quot; said Cyra Akila Choudhury, a law professor at Florida International University. &quot;So, private groups may choose to abide by religious law, such as Jews who abide by judgments made by rabbinical courts and Muslims who might abide by a decision made by their Sharia council or imam. But to assert that Sharia is being enforced by the state is entirely incorrect.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That exception -- the use of religious law to settle intra-community disputes between consenting parties, outside of the United States legal system -- is sometimes a source of confusion for critics of Sharia law, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Muslims choose to abide by Sharia as a private matter with regard to the practice of their religion, it is protected by the Constitution insofar as the practice does not contravene the laws of the land,&quot; Choudhury said. &quot;So, for example, Sharia principles of criminal law would not be given accommodation. Or, if you marry in the United States, your religious ceremony may not be recognized unless you have a state license and conform to the state&#39;s requirements.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League&rsquo;s Center on Extremism, agreed that his group knows of no such Sharia-ruled communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making such a suggestion, he added, &quot;feeds into the fear that Muslims are attempting to impose their laws on others in our country. Individual Muslims and their families may voluntarily observe Sharia-related rituals, but this is no different from Jews or Christians living their lives in accordance with the dictates of their own religious traditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuchman suggested that Moore might have been mistakenly referring to a satirical column <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/author/dean-obeidallah\">published</a> in the Daily Beast in 2015. The column, written by Muslim-American radio host and comedian <a href=\"http://deanofradio.com/about-dean/\">Dean Obeidallah</a>, was headlined, &quot;Next, We Muslims Bring Sharia to Indiana.&quot; It poked fun at Indiana, which was facing criticism for a new religious-liberty law signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the column, Obeidallah jokingly floated ways that Muslims could take advantage of a law that was mostly supported by conservative Christians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some might be asking, could Muslims really impose Sharia law in some fashion in Indiana -- turning Indiana into a mini Muslim caliphate?&quot; he wrote. &quot;Well, the Indiana law doesn&rsquo;t just provide &lsquo;religious liberty&rsquo; for Christians. It provides &lsquo;liberty&rsquo; for all faiths, and that includes us Muslims. &hellip; There are now so many things we can do in Indiana that we are not able to do in the rest of America,&quot; from taking more than one wife to requiring that restaurants institute halal-compliant rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we brought Moore&rsquo;s comments to Obeidallah&rsquo;s attention, he responded, &quot;LOL.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore said, &quot;There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country.
