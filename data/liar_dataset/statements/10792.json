That was the claim made a couple of times during the HBO/Showtime pay-per-view broadcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ticket sales topped $74 million (more than the Super Bowl), organizers said, and another 3 million people were expected to fork over $100 to watch the fight at home. Add in other sources of revenue and Saturday&rsquo;s event was projected to generate an estimated $400 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s &quot;larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries,&quot; HBO boxing sportscaster Jim Lampley said during the live broadcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not sure where Lampley and event organizers got their information from -- we weren&rsquo;t able to get in touch with him or someone from HBO -- but that figure is way off, according to the World Bank, which tracks global financial data for about 200 countries and territories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are only six countries with an annual Gross Domestic Product of less than $400 million, according to the bank&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2013 ranking</u></a>. (GDP is the monetary value of all goods and services that an economy produces in a year and a standard measurement of an economy&rsquo;s size).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All six are tiny island nations. Here are their 2013 GDPs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Micronesia: $316 million</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Sao Tome and Principe: $311 million</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Palau: $247 million</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Marshall Islands: $191 million</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Kiribati: $169 million</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Tuvalu: $38 million</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The country with the seventh-lowest GDP is Tonga, with a GDP of $466 million, just surpassing the estimated revenue of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. For comparison, the United States had the world&rsquo;s largest GDP in 2013 -- $16.8 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think one explanation for the large discrepancy with Lampley&rsquo;s claim is the fact that the World Bank doesn&rsquo;t have GDP data for 22 economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But of the missing 22, most are territories of other nations -- for example the United States territory of Guam or the British territory of the Cayman Islands. Only six without a 2013 World Bank GDP are fully independent nations: Andorra, North Korea, Liechtenstein, Myanmar, Somalia and Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked up the most recent GDP estimates we could find for each country to see if any were less than $400 million, but we found that all six exceeded that amount:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Andorra: $3.7 billion (2008 -- World Bank)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>North Korea: $28 billion (2009 -- CIA World Factbook)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Liechtenstein: $4.8 billion (2009 -- World Bank)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Myanmar: $64.3 billion (2014 -- CIA World Factbook)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Somalia: $2.4 billion (2010 -- CIA World Factbook)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Syria: $40.4 billion (2007 -- World Bank)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So in total, only six countries have GDPs smaller than the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lampley said the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was &quot;larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The match was estimated to generate about $400 million, which is a lot of money, to be sure. But only six out of the world&rsquo;s nearly 200 countries have GDPs smaller than that, according to World Bank data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re KO&rsquo;ing this claim.
