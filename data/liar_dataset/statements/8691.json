The Truth-O-Meter has checked a few that reference economic impact studies they say prove their point. But in many cases, they don&rsquo;t come close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An earlier PolitiFact analyzed the claims that the stadium would require no tax increase for homeowners and provide $3 million for Cobb schools. They were rated Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to look at Revitalize Cobb&rsquo;s jobs and wage figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s source is an economic impact study commissioned by the Cobb Chamber of Commerce, which has championed the stadium. It estimates the effects of two phases of the project &mdash; construction and the stadium&rsquo;s operations over 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysts assumed the ballpark will have 41,500 seats and attract 3 million fans during its first year. (The stadium is projected to open in 2017.) Attendance will stabilize at 2.7 million three years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction will require 5,227 jobs over three years, according to the report, which was prepared by program management firm Brailsford &amp; Dunlavey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also states that each year, operating the park will require 1,187 full-time jobs, 1,753 part-time jobs, and 1,074 &quot;nonprofit jobs,&quot; an unusual category that we will explain later.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add them up and you get 9,241 jobs, which is the figure used by Revitalize Cobb. The estimate of $295 million in wages combines the salaries earned over three years of construction with one year of wages for workers operating the park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a few problems with Revitalize Cobb&rsquo;s portrayal of the study&rsquo;s findings. Most jobs will not go to Cobb residents. And from a metro Atlanta and state perspective, by and large, these jobs aren&rsquo;t &quot;new.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s consider construction jobs. These were calculated using a measurement called a &quot;job year,&quot; which is equivalent to one full-time job lasting one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists use this measure to express the number of jobs created during the construction phase of a project because in this industry, positions can last for only a few months. So if four different plumbers worked three months each on the stadium, their combined efforts would equal one job year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the study, only 784 of these jobs -- or about 15 percent -- will go to Cobb residents. However, because of the nature of a job year, the stadium may put more than 784 Cobb residents to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ballpark&rsquo;s operation phase, the study counted a &quot;job&quot; as one position. Only about 27 percent of the full-time jobs and 30 percent of the part-time jobs are expected to go to county residents, the study states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revitalize Cobb&rsquo;s claim that the Braves move will result in $295 million in wages is also based on a regional number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The overall amount of wages is absolutely not the Cobb County payroll. No way,&quot; said Bruce Seaman, a professor at Georgia State University who has studied the economic impact of the Braves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revitalize Cobb did not hide this fact. Some of this breakdown appears in smaller type on the other side of the mailer. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But because the group used these numbers as proof that the stadium is &quot;1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents,&quot; readers could get the impression that the 9,241 jobs and $295 million in wages would go to locals, Seaman noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a state or regional perspective, these are not &quot;new&quot; jobs. For the most part, jobs that already exist in downtown Atlanta are simply moving to Cobb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re taking money out of one pocket and putting it in another,&quot; said Robert Baade, a Lake Forest College professor who studies the economics of sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And many workers at the downtown stadium may not move with the Braves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If these current workers stay behind, Cobb residents have a good shot at the vacancies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a more direct opportunity for Cobb County residents,&quot; said Jason Thompson, a vice president at the firm that produced the study. Plus, new ballparks often provide services that require teams to boost their staffing, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with Revitalize Cobb&rsquo;s claim is the group&rsquo;s decision to count 1,074 &quot;nonprofit&quot; jobs among the new positions that would be created by the Cobb stadium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These positions are the result of a Braves program where nonprofit volunteers work for free in stadium jobs, Thompson said. The wages they would have earned go to their nonprofit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This volunteer work does have an economic impact. Their labor infuses money into the economy. However, this isn&rsquo;t what your average person counts as jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By including them, Revitalize Cobb boosts its job numbers by 13 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the study&rsquo;s annual jobs figures seem a little high, the study&rsquo;s findings appear to be in the ballpark, said Georgia State University professor Seaman, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ruling:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revitalize Cobb used numbers generated by an economic impact study commissioned by the county&rsquo;s Chamber of Commerce, which supports the stadium. The study&rsquo;s findings are not unreasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the mailer published by Revitalize Cobb uses its findings in a confusing way that could give the impression that a new stadium&rsquo;s impact on Cobb is greater than the study predicts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the interest group tried to provide context through the mailer, it didn&rsquo;t do enough. It also added projected &quot;nonprofit&quot; positions to its jobs figures, which gives an inflated impression of the number of jobs the stadium is estimated to provide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pro-stadium mailer had an element of truth, but was a less-than-accurate portrayal of a flawed study commissioned by stadium boosters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revitalize Cobb earns a Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-19T17:10:23.904727", "ruling_date": "2013-12-20T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Braves stadium jobs and wages numbers fall short", "ruling_headline_slug": "braves-stadium-jobs-and-wages-numbers-fall-short", "ruling_link_text": "Field of dreams?
