Few of his plans ever become law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(Ryan) has actually proposed three &mdash; total, three &mdash; bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,&quot; David Canon was quoted as saying. &quot;Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He is an ideas guy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he <a href=\"http://www.gazettextra.com/20160602/paul_ryan_donald_trump_can_help_make_reality_of_bold_house_policy_agenda\">wrote</a> that the first step in setting policy agenda is &quot;putting it on paper and having a real debate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making his claim, Canon suggested Ryan doesn&rsquo;t follow his own advice &mdash; or hasn&rsquo;t had much success with it. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bills, bills, bills</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on &lsquo;evidence-based policy making.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A visit to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/paul-ryan/R000570?q=%7B%22bill-status%22%3A%22law%22%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%7D\">Ryan&rsquo;s profile at Congress.gov</a> shows &mdash; when filtered by &quot;Sponsored Legislation&quot; and &quot;Became Law&quot; &mdash; the same three bills referenced in the article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills &quot;sponsored&quot; by Ryan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill,&quot; Canon wrote in an email. &quot;Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement&rsquo;s context in the article reflects that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Ryan&rsquo;s camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan&rsquo;s tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Any realistic look at (Ryan&rsquo;s) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong,&quot; said spokesman Ian Martorana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/the-bipartisan-budget-act-of-2013/\">Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act</a> of 2013</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/hatch-wyden-and-ryan-introduce-trade-promotion-authority-legislation\">Trade Promotion Authority legislation</a> in 2015</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/text\">Bipartisan Budget Act</a> of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment,&quot; she wrote in an email. &quot;Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this legislator hasn&rsquo;t changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Measuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill&rsquo;s content and committee chairs, while they don&rsquo;t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is <a href=\"http://www.thelawmakers.org/#/find\">a tool developed by two professors</a> that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes into account the content of a lawmaker&rsquo;s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker&rsquo;s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker&rsquo;s impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canon told the New York Times that Ryan &quot;has actually proposed three &mdash; total, three &mdash; bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canon was referring to bills Ryan solely sponsored and is on target by that measure. But the claim suggests Ryan has been an unproductive lawmaker. Another tool out there provides a better view, but &mdash; like Canon &mdash; ignores legislation Ryan helped author but didn&rsquo;t solely sponsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a76b05-8d40-4be1-a98d-32bb0f903f19\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a76b05-8d40-4be1-a98d-32bb0f903f19</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-09T16:47:05.732257", "ruling_date": "2016-08-10T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Professor: House Speaker Paul Ryan has only proposed three bills that became law in his career.", "ruling_headline_slug": "professor-house-speaker-paul-ryan-has-only-propose", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but other ways to measure effectiveness.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/opinion/sunday/paul-ryans-worst-ally.html?_r=0\">Paul Ryan&rsquo;s Worst Ally</a>,&quot; by Jackie Calmes, New York Times, July 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.gazettextra.com/20160602/paul_ryan_donald_trump_can_help_make_reality_of_bold_house_policy_agenda\">Paul Ryan: Donald Trump can help make reality of bold House policy agenda</a>&quot;, Janesville Gazette, June 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with UW-Madison Professor David Canon, July 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with New York Times reporter Jackie Calmes, July 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Ian Martorana, Ryan spokesman, July 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with George Mason University Professor Jennifer Victor, July 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/paul-ryan/R000570?q=%7B%22bill-status%22%3A%22law%22%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%7D\">Ryan&rsquo;s Congress.gov profile</a>, accessed July 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelawmakers.org/#/\">TheLawmakers.org</a>, project of Professor Craig Volden of the University of Virginia and Professor Alan E.
