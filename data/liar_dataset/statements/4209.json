Rick Perry told the <em>New Hampshire Union Leader</em> the state&rsquo;s fiscal efficiency matters most, adding that Texas &quot;has, I believe, the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTruth-O-Meter on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome background: Last year, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/mar/04/bill-white/white-says-texas-debt-has-doubled-under-perry/\">we rated</a> True a claim by Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White that the state&rsquo;s debt load had doubled in Perry&rsquo;s then-nine-plus years as governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Texas Bond Review Board, which oversees the issuance of most state bonds, Texas had $34.08 billion in outstanding bonds and notes as of Aug. 31, 2009, the end of fiscal 2009. That figure increased 11 percent to $37.82 billion as of Aug. 31, 2010, primarily due to increased debt commitments by colleges and universities and transportation-related debt, the board&rsquo;s 2010 annual <a href=\"http://www.brb.state.tx.us/pub/bfo/AR/AR2010.pdf\">report </a>says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd how does the state&rsquo;s debt boil out per resident?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report says that in 2007-08, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, Texas was home to the second-most residents among the states, but ranked ninth among the 10 most populous states in state debt per capita, at $1,369 per resident. The report says New York topped the most populous states with state per-capita debt of $5,861.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we asked the Census Bureau if it had more up-to-date figures. Spokeswoman Jenna Arnold pointed us to <a href=\"http://http%3a%2f%2fwww2.census.gov%2fgovs%2fstate%2f09statess.xls/\">an online table</a> listing each state&rsquo;s debt in 2009. Drawing on the bureau&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=&amp;-ds_name=PEP_2009_EST&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-mt_name=PEP_2009_EST_GCTT1_US40&amp;-format=US-40%7CU-40Sa%7CU-40Sb%7CU-40Sc%7CU-40Sd%7CU-40Se%7CU-40Sf%7CU-40Sg%7CU-40Sh%7CUS-40S&amp;-CONTEXT=gct\">2009 population estimates for the states</a>, we then calculated per-capita figures for the 10 most populous states that year. Texas&rsquo; per-capita state debt came out to $1,227, less than the per-capita debt of the nine other states. The other states: New York ($6,279 per capita); Illinois ($4,415); California ($3,642); Pennsylvania ($3,324); Michigan ($2,969); Ohio ($2,426); North Carolina ($2,121); Florida ($2,098); and Georgia ($1,374).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, we peeked at <a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/268.html\">a post</a> by the Washington-based Tax Foundation listing a slightly different per-capita figure for the state&rsquo;s fiscal 2009 debt level, $1,240, placing Texas 49th among the 50 states. Massachusetts, ranked No. 1, had per-capita debt of $11,357.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor more perspective, we turned to the bond review board, whose executive director, Robert Kline, passed along a May 25, 2011, report by Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, <a href=\"http://moodys.com/Pages/atc.aspx\">which provides</a> credit ratings and research covering debt instruments and securities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report covers state debt levels in 2010, stating: &quot;Two measures of state debt burden &mdash; debt per capita and debt as a percentage of personal income &mdash; are commonly used by analysts to compare the debt burden of one state to another. Debt burden is one of many factors that Moody&rsquo;s uses to determine state credit quality. In considering debt burden, the focus is largely on net tax-supported debt, which Moody&rsquo;s characterizes as debt secured by state resources.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Texas ranked 39th among the states, at $612 per capita, in net tax-supported debt, the report says. The national average for states was $1,404. The states with less debt than Texas were all less populous: Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Montana, Arkansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa and Nebraska, which is listed as having the least per-capita net tax-supported debt among the states at $13.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe noticed the Moody&rsquo;s per-capita figures were smaller than those reached using the census data. That&rsquo;s because the census bureau&rsquo;s state debt totals wrap in more kinds of debt--for example, tuition revenue bonds issued on behalf of institutions of higher education. The bureau <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy02/pdf/guide.pdf\">defines its debt tally</a> as &quot;long-term credit obligations of the government and its agencies whether backed by the governments&#39; full faith and credit or non-guaranteed.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the governor, speaking off the top of his head in the newspaper interview, had based his debt claims on Moody&rsquo;s information. &quot;Texas does have the lowest debt per capita of the top 10 most populous states,&quot; Frazier said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrazier said Perry&rsquo;s other claim, about Texas having the fourth-lowest debt per capita among the states, ties to Moody&rsquo;s calculation of each state&rsquo;s ratio of debt to gross state product. By that measure, she said, Texas is sixth lowest among the states. Indeed, the Moody&rsquo;s report says Texas has a ratio of 1.66 percent, lower than ratios for every state except Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. The national average is nearly 4.5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report says the ratio is useful for comparing different states and countries. In an interview, Moody&rsquo;s analyst Nicole Johnson said that a relatively low ratio generally means a state has more flexibility to increase its debt than states with high ratios.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Texas has the least state debt per capita among the most populous states, as Perry says, and by Moody&rsquo;s accounting the 12th lowest of all states. Perry incorrectly said it was fourth-lowest of all states, but his meaning holds up; Texas is a relatively low-debt state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-29T15:39:33.156450", "ruling_date": "2011-08-06T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rick Perry says Texas has lowest per-capita state debt of big states and fourth-lowest of all states", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-perry-says-texas-has-lowest-capita-state-debt", "ruling_link_text": "Seven places off among all states", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>New Hampshire Union-Leader</em>, news article, <a href=\"http://www.unionleader.com/article/20110724/NEWS0605/707249985/-1/news\">&quot;Perry gives first NH interview,&quot;</a> July 24, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoody&rsquo;s Investors Service, charts, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RbTxHQ7Aj7hyfU7C8HAKgYYEM21yUpZKmliGst3Ol7I/http%3A%2F%2Falt.coxnewsweb.com%2Fstatesman%2Fpolitifact%2F07282011_moodys2011netstatetaxsupporteddebtchart.doc\">&quot; 2011 Net Tax-Supported Debt by State&quot;</a> and <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/07282011_moodyschartratio2011.doc\">&quot;Net Tax-Supported Debt as % of Gross State Domestic Product,*</a> May 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Andrew Nowicki, associate analyst, Nicole Johnson, senior analyst, Public Finance Group, Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, New York, July 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas Bond Review Board, report, <a href=\"http://www.brb.state.tx.us/pub/bfo/AR/AR2010.pdf\">&quot;Fiscal 2010 Annual Report,&quot;</a> December 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, charts, <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/govs/state/09statess.xls\">&quot;State Government Finances: 2009,&quot;</a> last revised January 13, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 30, "current_job": "U.S. Energy Secretary", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 42, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 291, "last_name": "Perry", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "rick-perry", "pants_count": 18, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Perry_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/291/", "total_count": 176, "true_count": 26, "website": "https://energy.gov/management/history/secretaries-energy"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Texas has &quot;the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an interview.", "statement_date": "2011-07-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
