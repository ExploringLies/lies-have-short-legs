John McCain's conservative stripes, and the idea that he was a potential running mate for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 stokes their suspicions even more.\n<p>\n The advocacy group Citizens United Political Victory Fund is currently on the attack, launching an ad that at first appears to be aimed at Hillary Clinton.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"One candidate voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times. ...

Here are just a few:\n</p>\n<p>\n &bull; In March 2004, reports about the offer prompted\n <i>\n  Good Morning America\n </i>\n host Charles Gibson to ask McCain about it in an interview on the show. McCain answered: \"John Kerry is a very close friend of mine. We've been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it. But there's, I see no scenario, no scenario, no scenario where I, I foresee no scenario where that would happen.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n &bull; After Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate in July 2004, the\n <i>\n  Washington Post\n </i>\n reported that Kerry initiated phone calls to McCain about a possible crossover ticket, \"but McCain made clear he was not interested.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n &bull; A February 2007 article in\n <i>\n  Vanity Fair\n </i>\n magazine titled \"Prisoner of Conscience\" says: \"Kerry felt close enough to McCain at the time to make multiple and serious inquiries about McCain's interest in running for vice president on a national-unity ticket (and McCain basked in the courtship, even if he knew nothing could ever come of it).\n</p>\n<p>\n &bull; And, in an April 2007 interview with the Web site myDD.com (Direct Democracy for People-Powered Politics), Kerry says McCain's people approached him about being on the Democratic ticket. Responding to suggestions that McCain had approached prominent Democrats about switching parties, Kerry says: \"It doesn't surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president. So his people were active &mdash; let's put it that way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We're not saying McCain gave the idea much thought or even that he was offered the job, but it's clear he \"was mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry.\" We rule this statement True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:24.132668", "ruling_date": "2008-02-04T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "That's the ticket", "ruling_headline_slug": "thats-the-ticket", "ruling_link_text": "That's the ticket", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "MittRomney.com,\n<a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/Kerry_McCain\">\n Campaign press release,\n</a>\n\"Welcome to Massachusetts!\" Feb. 4, 2008\n<p>\n New York Times blog, \"The Caucus,\"\n <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/romney-links-mccain-to-democrats-even-kerry/\">\n  Romney Links McCain to Democrats &mdash; Even Kerry,\n </a>\n by Michael Luo, Jan. 28, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Good Morning America,\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkcVXIhssCI\">\n  Interview with Sen.
