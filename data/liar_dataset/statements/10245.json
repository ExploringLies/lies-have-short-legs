Jeb Bush said in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2014/nov/18/fact-checking-jeb-bush-possible-presidential-conte/\">speech</a> that we shouldn&rsquo;t worry so much about students&rsquo; self-esteem when it comes to setting grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he wagged his finger at Orange County, Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This morning, over 213 million Chinese students went to school and nobody debated whether academic expectations should be lowered in order to protect their students&rsquo; self esteem,&quot; he said in his keynote to the National Summit on Education Reform on Nov. 20, 2014. &quot;Yet in Orange County, Fla., last week I read that debate actually did occur at a school board meeting. The school board voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50. You get 50 out of 100 just for showing up and signing your name. This was done&nbsp; -- and I quote here from a local official -- &lsquo;so that the students do not lose all hope.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush went on to cite statistics that showed students in Shanghai far outranking their peers in the United States in reading and math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;An overriding concern for self-esteem instead of high expectations does not get you to No. 1,&quot; he said. &quot;It gets you to No. 21.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is 50 the new zero in Orange County schools? We went in search of answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Orange County</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 11, the Orange County school board took a <a href=\"https://www.ocps.net/es/cr/videos/Pages/SchoolBoardMeetings.aspx\">vote</a> on grading policies for middle and high school students that has <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/09/students-in-orlando-public-schools-now-get-grades-of-50-percent-for-doing-nothing/\">received widespread</a> <a href=\"http://tampa.cbslocal.com/2014/11/12/florida-school-district-wont-give-grades-below-50/\">attention</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vote was part of changes to the district&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.boarddocs.com/fla/orcpsfl/Board.nsf/Public\">&quot;student progression plan,&quot;</a> which outlines instructional goals and policies for the year. One piece of that plan related to a new grading policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocps.net/es/cr/videos/Pages/SchoolBoardMeetings.aspx\">Superintendent Barbara Jenkins</a> told the board that one provision would ban grades lower than a 50 when grades for the nine-week quarter or semester are determined. However, grades below a 50 would still be possible on individual assignments. In other words, students could still get lower than a 50 on a specific test, but no longer for the entire grading period. The district already started the policy last year; the purpose of the board&rsquo;s vote was to codify the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to give students some hope that if they are failing early in the year, they can catch up and ultimately pass the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, 43 percent of students in the county who got an &quot;F&quot; the first quarter ended up failing the class. However the remainder of students were able to recover, with the majority getting a &quot;D.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is still very difficult for children to recover if that nine-week grade is an F,&quot; Jenkins told the school board. &quot;However, stopping them at 50 does not bury them so deep that they lose all hope and have no reason to continue for the rest of year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some teachers told the school board they opposed the policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Are we really helping students by inflating grades, or are we harming them?&quot; asked high school teacher Wendy Doromal. &quot;I say we are harming them by conditioning them to think they can skate by with little effort.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the board members supported the plan as a way to give students one last chance to pull their grades out of a failing mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s just to help kids dig themselves out of a hole,&quot; school board member Daryl Flynn said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The school board voted in favor of the plan, 7-1, with member Rick Roach dissenting. (Board chair Bill Sublette said he opposed the 50 percent rule, however he said was voting &quot;yes&quot; for the overall plan which included several policies related to student assessment.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orange County school officials determined that their grading plan follows state law -- however the state Department of Education hasn&rsquo;t weighed in on whether it agress with that assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the state&rsquo;s public schools chancellor wrote a memo to superintendents in 2009 raising concerns that some were not using the 0-59 scale set in state law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=1000-1099/1003/Sections/1003.437.html\">Florida statute</a> sets grade ranges as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>90 &ndash; 100 = A</p>\r\n\r\n<p>80 &ndash; 89 = B</p>\r\n\r\n<p>70 &ndash; 79 = C</p>\r\n\r\n<p>60 &ndash; 69 = D</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0 &ndash; 59 = Failure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many districts, including Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas, follow those guidelines and haven&rsquo;t added any rules setting 50 as a minimum standard for report cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We give kids the grade they earn,&quot; Hillsborough spokesman Stephen Hegarty told PolitiFact. &quot;If it&#39;s below 50, then you get a 30 or a zero, or whatever score you earn.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The topic of setting a minimum number for an &quot;F&quot; grade has been hotly contested <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-05-18-zeroes-main_N.htm\">nationwide</a>, including in New York, Oregon and Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a Texas school district proposed a minimum F grade, the state Legislature passed a Truth-In-Grading law. A <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20100628-Texas-judge-knocks-down-minimum-grading-5938.ece\">judge upheld</a> the law in 2010, ruling against school districts that argued they could require teachers to give minimum grades such as a 50 on report cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Experts weigh in</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is what Orange County&rsquo;s doing tantamount to grade inflation? Not necessarily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main concern about grade inflation hasn&rsquo;t been about making F students into D students -- it has been about making A the most common grade in high schools and colleges, said <a href=\"http://www.stuartr.com/cv.html\">Stuart Rojstaczer</a>, a former Duke University geology professor who has done research on grading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The impact of even a nationwide policy of &lsquo;no less than 50&rsquo; on GPAs would be tiny,&quot; he told PolitiFact. &quot;We&#39;re taking Joe and Jane Averages and making their parents believe they are Joe and Jane Geniuses. The Joe and Jane Flunkers are still flunking out of school.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Bush&rsquo;s statement, Rojstaczer said &quot;A &lsquo;no less than 50&rsquo; policy isn&#39;t about self esteem. It&#39;s about trying to make it possible for a small percentage of students to barely cross over the bar and graduate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas Guskey, a University of Kentucky Education professor, made the case against percentage grades in a 2013 article in <em><a href=\"http://dumais.us/newtown/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Guskey_2013_The-Case-Against-Percentage-Grades.pdf\">Educational Leadership</a></em>, a publication of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guskey wrote that &quot;although some have suggested minimum grade policies promote grade inflation and social promotion in schools, well-designed, longitudinal studies show this is not the case,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Rather, school districts implement minimum-grade policies simply to eliminate the confounding effects of a zero in a percentage grading system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said that the Orange County school board &quot;voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50.
