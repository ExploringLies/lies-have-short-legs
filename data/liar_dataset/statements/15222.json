But did a Republican congressman from West Virginia get it right when he cited a statistic on that point in a recent <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/steel-and-aluminum-lets-talk-about-gold-1522005011\">op-ed</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney wrote March 25 that &quot;from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mooney was broadly accurate when looking at raw employment totals. But the point does not hold up when you factor in population growth &mdash; a more telling statistic. (Mooney&rsquo;s staff did not respond to inquiries for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the raw numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of U.S. manufacturing employees bounced around in a fairly narrow range between 1970 and 2000, before plunging between 2000 and 2010. (Left out by Mooney: National manufacturing employment has risen modestly but consistently since 2010.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s in line with what Mooney wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you adjust for the surge in U.S. population between 1970 and today, the pattern looks different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than &quot;holding steady for 30 years,&quot; the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing actually fell consistently between 1970 and 2000. The rate of decline accelerated a bit between 2000 and 2010, but not by much. And the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing has stabilized, and actually increased slightly, since 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, agreed that the pattern depends heavily on which measure you use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Measured as a percentage of total employment, manufacturing employment has been falling pretty steadily since World War II,&quot; he said. &quot;The growth in manufacturing labor productivity, the growth of imported manufactured products as a share of the manufactured goods we consume, and the shift in consumers&rsquo; taste away from manufactured goods toward services -- especially health care services -- has meant that we do not need as many U.S. manufacturing employees to produce all the manufactured goods we consume in a given year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious how the pattern looked for West Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that manufacturing jobs in West Virginia did remain pretty constant prior to 2000 before falling off a cliff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manufacturing jobs as a percentage of West Virginia&rsquo;s population held steady between 1990 and 2000, then dropped significantly between 2000 and 2010. As with the other measures, manufacturing employment as a percentage of the state&rsquo;s population has remained strikingly stable since 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mooney wrote that &quot;from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mooney&rsquo;s statistic is accurate in&nbsp;raw numbers. The one caveat is if you measure manufacturing employment as a percentage of the population &mdash; which accounts for significant population growth over that period &mdash; you can see a steady decline going back decades. Manufacturing&rsquo;s footprint in the labor market shrank consistently, and by more than half, during the period he cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-04T12:05:31.009864", "ruling_date": "2018-04-04T14:36:24", "ruling_headline": "How far has U.S. manufacturing employment fallen?", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-far-has-us-manufacturing-employment-fallen", "ruling_link_text": "Population matters", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Alex Mooney, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/steel-and-aluminum-lets-talk-about-gold-1522005011\">Steel and Aluminum?
