At a news conference after its 63-35 passage, Brown called it &quot;the largest bipartisan jobs bill&quot; to win approval in many months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpponents said they feared the legislation could spark a trade war with China at a time when the U.S. economy is already weak.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown responded: &quot;Ohio workers and Ohio manufacturers already know that we are, in fact, in a trade war, and the Chinese have done very well, thank you.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The reason that this won&#39;t start the kind of trade war where the Chinese start being more aggressive even than they have been is we buy 35 percent of all Chinese exports,&quot; he said. &quot;They can&#39;t go to a trade war with a country that is such an important customer to them.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim that more than one-third of China&rsquo;s exports are sold in U.S. markets got PolitiFact Ohio&rsquo;s attention. We decided to take a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown&rsquo;s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, immediately told us that Brown &quot;misspoke when he said 35 percent. The figure is closer to 25 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe referred us to the most recent statistics from the World Trade Organization. They show that China&#39;s exports totaled $1.2 trillion in 2009, and the U.S. imported $310 billion of them, or 26 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked further and found statistics from the U.S.-China Business Council, the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S Trade Representative that also showed the U.S. accounting for roughly 25 percent of Chinese exports.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey showed that the United States is China&#39;s largest export market by a wide margin, spending about 30 percent more than second-ranked Hong Kong, more than twice as much as third-ranked Japan and buying more than four times the volume of fourth-place South Korea.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe United States buys more than the next six countries in the top 10 combined.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy coincidence, we found that Portman made a slip of the tongue several months ago while discussing trade with China, just a Brown did here. We rated that claim Half True and said then that his underlying point remained.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this case, Brown gave an incorrect number for the U.S. percentage of Chinese exports, which his staff readily pointed it out and corrected. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegardless of that slip, he is correct that the United States is China&rsquo;s top export destination. A one-quarter share is not as hefty as a one third share would be, but either way, the United States remains the most significant market for Chinese exports.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut while PolitiFact Ohio isn&rsquo;t looking to play Gotcha!, a key tenet is that words matter. In this case, Brown&rsquo;s number is nearly 30 percent greater than the correct figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-19T18:49:37.149355", "ruling_date": "2011-10-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sherrod Brown says 35 percent of China's exports land in U.S. markets", "ruling_headline_slug": "sherrod-brown-says-35-percent-chinas-exports-land-", "ruling_link_text": "Slip of the tongue doesn't destroy underlying point", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTranscript, Members of the Senate hold a news conference on the China currency bill, Washington, Oct. 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/185223-china-currency-bill-clears-hurdle%3Fpage%3D1\">Senate votes 79-19 to move bill punishing China on currency</a>,&quot; Oct. 3, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/186841-senate-pressures-china-house-by-passing-currency-bill\">Senate puts pressure on House, China by passing currency bill</a>,&quot; Oct. 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail with Sen.
