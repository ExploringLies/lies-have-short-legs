It&rsquo;s little more than <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/78th2015/Bills/SJR/SJR21_EN.pdf\">two pages</a> listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include &quot;earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship.&quot; It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in <a href=\"https://nelis.leg.state.nv.us/77th2013/App#/77th2013/Bill/Votes/SJR15\">2013</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution &quot;pro-amnesty&quot; is harder to prove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seaman&rsquo;s campaign sent a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PpDlhGJAYLyAZWE-FTiTPOMukpyVK1wsZUdN_RP2_c/edit?usp=sharing\">two-page letter</a> arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as &quot;citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use of the word &quot;amnesty&quot; in immigration policy is contentious, and there&rsquo;s no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact did look into use of the word &quot;amnesty&quot; by Republicans critical of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposed immigration policies in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/feb/01/paul-broun/congressman-tweets-obama-wants-amnesty-during-stat/\">2011</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/20/jim-demint/immigration-plan-enforcement-amnesty/\">2012</a>, but it&rsquo;s much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as &quot;amnesty&quot;, but the resolution is just so vague that it&rsquo;s difficult to call it &quot;pro-amnesty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politically&nbsp;charged word is &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/feb/01/paul-broun/congressman-tweets-obama-wants-amnesty-during-stat/\">debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resolution additionally doesn&rsquo;t really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, &quot;<a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/may/19/three-immigration-bills-watch-nevada-legislature/\">send a strong message to Congress</a>&quot; to take up immigration reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson didn&rsquo;t answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both lawmakers voted for a <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/78th2015/Bill/1217/Overview\">successful measure</a> making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to <a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/may/19/three-immigration-bills-watch-nevada-legislature/\">get a teacher&rsquo;s license in Nevada</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/78th2015/Bill/1454/Overview\">measure prohibiting</a> contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, there just isn&rsquo;t a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of &quot;<a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/may/19/three-immigration-bills-watch-nevada-legislature/\">symbolic</a>&quot; gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as it&rsquo;s almost entirely a federally managed issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevada did approve <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/dmv-nevada-has-issued-20000-plus-driving-cards-first-six-months\">driver authorization cards</a> for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/78th2015/Minutes/Assembly/LOE/Final/1078.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>earlier committee </u></a>meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A <a href=\"http://nvleg.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=14&amp;clip_id=4815\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>video of the meeting</u></a> is online, but it&rsquo;s difficult to tell if she&rsquo;s present during the voice vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That isn&rsquo;t necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seaman&rsquo;s campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seaman says Nelson voted &quot;yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging&nbsp;Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, the &quot;bill&quot; was actually a resolution that holds no teeth. It calls for&nbsp;a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. But it&#39;s too vague to blankly say&nbsp;it falls under the &quot;amnesty&quot; umbrella, and just doesn&rsquo;t mean much in the grand scheme of the immigration debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-05T16:29:49.491377", "ruling_date": "2016-04-05T17:13:52", "ruling_headline": "Immigration debate enters key Nevada state Senate race", "ruling_headline_slug": "immigration-debate-enters-key-nevada-state-senate-", "ruling_link_text": "Revisiting the 'amnesty' debate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Phone interview with Susan Furlong, Assembly Chief Clerk, April 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Ryan Hamilton, Victoria Seaman for Senate District 6 campaign manager, March 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Las Vegas Sun, &quot;<a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/may/19/three-immigration-bills-watch-nevada-legislature/\">Three immigration bills to watch at the Nevada Legislature</a>,&quot; May 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News Latino, &quot;<a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/02/10/nevada-bill-aims-to-extend-teaching-licenses-to-more-dreamers/\">Nevada bill aims to extend teaching licenses to more DREAMers</a>,&quot; Feb. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/nevada-has-top-share-unauthorized-immigrants\">Nevada has top share of unauthorized immigrants</a>,&quot; November 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roll Call, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/white-house/immigration-bill-officially-dead-boehner-tells-obama-no-vote-this-year/\">Immigration Bill Officially Dead: Boehner Tells Obama No Vote This Year, President Says</a>,&quot; June 30, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Las Vegas Review-Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/dmv-nevada-has-issued-20000-plus-driving-cards-first-six-months\">DMV: Nevada has issued 20,000-plus driving cards in first six months</a>,&quot; June 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/20/jim-demint/immigration-plan-enforcement-amnesty/\">Jim DeMint and other Republicans say Obama immigration plan is amnesty</a>,&quot; June 20, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/feb/01/paul-broun/congressman-tweets-obama-wants-amnesty-during-stat/\">Congressman tweets Obama pro- &quot;amnesty&quot; during State of the Union</a>,&quot; Feb. 1, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Victoria", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Nevada", "id": 3456, "last_name": "Seaman", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "victoria-seaman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/seaman_headshot.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Nevada", "edition": "Nevada", "edition_slug": "nevada", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 57, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Nevada Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/57/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3456/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://victoriaseaman.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Erv Nelson voted &quot;yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging&nbsp;Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in campaign literature distributed at a candidate forum", "statement_date": "2016-03-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
