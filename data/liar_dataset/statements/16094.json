She argues that the program would not be financially viable, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>On paper, the new program guarantees hospital care, doctors&rsquo; visits, even dental, vision and long-term care, all paid for by Uncle Sam. Here&rsquo;s the hitch: Hospitals will be forced to operate under conditions of extreme scarcity, with too little revenue and more patients than ever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Medicare shortchanges hospitals, paying them less than the full cost of caring for seniors. But hospitals accept the low payments, because they can shift the unmet costs to younger patients who have private insurance that pays more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut in the new scheme, hospitals will be paid at Medicare rates for all their patients, not just seniors (Sec. 611). With everyone on Medicare for All, no cost-shifting will be possible.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would ultimately happen if Medicare for All ever became law, of course, is unknown, though there are plenty of questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, health care policy expert <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/staff/robert-e-moffit-phd\">Robert Moffit</a> at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that with Medicare, &quot;the addition of new benefits, procedures and the availability of new medical technologies has traditionally lagged behind private (insurance) plans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as proposed -- as even the expert cited by Vukmir acknowledges -- Medicare for All would offer senior citizens more coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Vukmir says Baldwin&rsquo;s &quot;Medicare for All&quot; means senior citizens would &quot;no longer have&quot; Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicare, along with other government and private health insurance programs, would be replaced if Medicare for All ever became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not as though senior citizens would lose Medicare and be left with nothing. In fact, as proposed, Medicare for All would provide them more benefits than they get with current Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vukmir&rsquo;s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression &mdash; our definition of Mostly False.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-25T17:58:56.352863", "ruling_date": "2018-10-26T03:25:15", "ruling_headline": "Leah Vukmir's attack on Tammy Baldwin ignores that Medicare for All would replace, enhance Medicare ", "ruling_headline_slug": "leah-vukmirs-attack-tammy-baldwin-ignores-medicare", "ruling_link_text": "More coverage for seniors proposed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WISN-TV, <a href=\"https://www.wisn.com/article/live-on-wisn-12-at-7-pm-baldwin-vukmir-debate-at-marquette-university-law-school/23940578\">Tammy Baldwin-Leah Vukmir debate</a> (16:00), Oct. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Leah Vukmir campaign spokesman Jahan Wilcox, Oct. 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt, Oct. 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/14/us/impact-of-sanders-medicare-for-all-plan.html\">&quot;How Medicare for All affects you,&quot;</a> Sept. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/upshot/how-the-bernie-sanders-plan-would-both-beef-up-and-slim-down-medicare.html\">&quot;How the Bernie Sanders Plan Would Both Beef Up and Slim Down Medicare,&quot;</a> Sept. 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Sen.
