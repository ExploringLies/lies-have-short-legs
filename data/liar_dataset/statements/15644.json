While those are shown, Roys says: &quot;Just when you think it can&rsquo;t get any worse, it does.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Roys is shown writing on a pad of paper and she says: &quot;In Wisconsin, abortion is still a crime.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More images of Roys appear as she says: &quot;And I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m having to fight the same fights that my grandmother fought.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad could leave the impression that a woman getting an abortion is committing a crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Federal law vs. state law</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we posed Roys&rsquo; claim to former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/faculty-and-staff-directory/detail/206250\">Janine Geske</a>, a professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, she confirmed, in light of Roe vs. Wade, what seems obvious:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not a crime in Wisconsin.
