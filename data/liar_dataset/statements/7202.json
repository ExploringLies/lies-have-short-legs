You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found that Booker slightly overstated the number of gun-related homicides that occur on a daily basis, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC tracks the causes of deaths for residents of the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mayor&rsquo;s claim about 34 murders per day refers to CDC figures showing the average number of Americans killed with guns every day between 2005 and 2009, according to a statement released by the mayor&rsquo;s office in response to this fact-check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the statement acknowledges that, with the CDC&rsquo;s final numbers for 2010, the five-year rolling average drops slightly to roughly 33 gun-related homicides per day between 2006 and 2010. The 2010 figures represent the most recent final data available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Whether we are losing 34 Americans a day, or 33 Americans a day, the point stands that this is an unacceptable and largely correctable epidemic, and the Mayor believes that we must immediately and intensely focus on common-sense, achievable measures that will save lives in Newark and in communities across the country,&quot; the statement reads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number of gun-related murders per day drops even further when you only consider deaths recently recorded in individual years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, there were 11,078 gun-related homicides, or roughly 30 per day. According to preliminary figures for 2011, there were 11,101 homicides last year, which also is roughly 30 murders per day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth figures represent a roughly 13 percent decrease since there were 12,791 gun-related murders in 2006, or about 35 homicides every day. That statistic represented the highest amount for any year in the last decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, the annual number of gun-related homicides dropped every year from 2007 to 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also worth noting that homicides represent only part of all gun-related deaths.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, for example, there were a total of 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606); undetermined (252); and legal intervention/war (344).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a TV appearance, Booker claimed, &quot;You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day&quot; by gunfire in America.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mayor&rsquo;s statistic isn&rsquo;t far off. According to the most recent data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a five-year rolling average of final CDC figures puts the number of gun-related murders at about 33 per day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn terms of individual years, there were about 30 gun-related homicides on a daily basis in 2010 and 2011. That figure marks a reduction since the roughly 35 murders per day recorded in 2006, which was the highest amount for any year in the last decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/12/politifact_nj_cory_booker_says_2.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-12-26T15:23:03.155059", "ruling_date": "2012-12-27T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Cory Booker says 34 Americans are killed by guns every day", "ruling_headline_slug": "cory-booker-says-34-americans-are-killed-guns-ever", "ruling_link_text": "Not too far off", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-asa-hutchinson-sen-johnny-isakson-sen/story?id=18044867#.UNiGrSJhVIw\">&#39;This Week&#39; Transcript: Asa Hutchinson, Sen.
