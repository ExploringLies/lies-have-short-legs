Just how much does it cost taxpayers to run the Wisconsin governor&rsquo;s mansion -- ahem, <em>executive residence</em>?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToo much, says state Sen. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&amp;district=22&amp;display=bio\">Bob Wirch</a>, a Democrat from Pleasant Prairie in Kenosha County. Echoing <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UsAaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YEUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=ruth%20doyle%20mansion&amp;pg=6614,6778885\">a </a><a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UsAaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YEUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=ruth%20doyle%20mansion&amp;pg=6614,6778885\">call</a> he made in 2002, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was elected, Wirch wants Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker to sell or lease the 34-room manor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Over the course of one four-year term,&quot; Wirch claimed in a <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=218101\">news </a><a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=218101\">release</a> Nov. 15, 2010, &quot;it costs taxpayers more than $1 million simply to operate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWirch also noted Walker&rsquo;s own <a href=\"http://www.transition.wi.gov/stateemployee_suggestion.asp?locid=177\">call to </a><a href=\"http://www.transition.wi.gov/stateemployee_suggestion.asp?locid=177\">citizens</a> for ideas on how to make state government run more efficiently. After all, with a <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/Misc/2010_07_09_WI%20Leg.pdf\">structural deficit</a>, lost revenue because of a state Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/98824539.html\">decision</a> and other issues, the new governor faces a projected shortfall of <a href=\"http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/publications/workingpapers/reschovsky2010-016.pdf\">$3 </a><a href=\"http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/publications/workingpapers/reschovsky2010-016.pdf\">billion</a> for the 2011-&rsquo;13 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It is hard to set a good example,&quot; Wirch said in his statement, &quot;if you are living in a mansion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker, who will be <a href=\"http://www.transition.wi.gov/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=177&amp;prid=5489\">inaugurated</a> Jan. 3, 2011, plans to move with his family from Wauwatosa into the residence, said his spokesman, Cullen Werwie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said Walker has no comment on Wirch&rsquo;s recommendation to sell or lease the mansion, which is perched on the shores of Lake Mendota.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe home&rsquo;s &quot;replacement value&quot; is $1.63 million, according to the state Department of Administration. But Wirch believes that with its 3.7 acres of land, the estate is worth more than $2.5 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerhaps, like us, you&rsquo;ve never been to the mansion (although you can see it in <a href=\"http://jessicadoyle.wi.gov/category.asp?linkcatid=887&amp;linkid=440&amp;locid=71\">pictures</a>).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, according to the Department of Administration, the state Historical Society and the office of first lady Jessica Doyle, it:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIs a three-story, 21,000-square-foot (including basement) <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/ahi/detailrecord.asp\">Georgian </a><a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/ahi/detailrecord.asp\">Revival</a>in Maple Bluff, a village northeast of Madison.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWas built in 1921 for Madison industrialist Carl A. Johnson and became home to governors after being purchased by the state in 1949.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tHas 13 bathrooms, seven bedrooms, seven fireplaces and seven garden areas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNice. So, who takes care of it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://jessicadoyle.wi.gov/category.asp?linkcatid=888&amp;linkid=440&amp;locid=71\">Seven employees</a>, according to Vicki Heymann, the mansion&rsquo;s residence director. Full-timers include Heymann, a chef, a gardener and a &quot;facilities maintenance specialist.&quot; The part-timers are a housekeeper, a &quot;laundress and flower arranger,&quot; and the head of the waitstaff, who has worked at the mansion for more than 32 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK, now let&rsquo;s get to Wirch&rsquo;s claim that operating the mansion costs more than $1 million during a four-year term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWirch&rsquo;s office said the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau put the operating costs at $265,000 per year. That would come to $1.06 million over four years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senator&rsquo;s per-year number is a touch high, but his four-year figure of more than $1 million is on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe fiscal bureau told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the mansion&rsquo;s operating expenses are budgeted at $262,500 in 2009-&rsquo;10 and the same amount for 2010-&rsquo;11, nearly all of which is salaries. That&rsquo;s a total of $1.05 million over four years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, actual expenditures are running higher, according to the state Department of Administration. They were $290,462 in 2008-&rsquo;09 and $273,340 in 2009-&rsquo;10. If that were carried out over four years, the total would be $1.13 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin is one of 44 states that provided a governor&rsquo;s residence as of 2004, according to the most recent <a href=\"http://www.nga.org/Files/pdf/05OMCTEXECRESIDENCE.PDF\">survey</a> done by the National Governors Association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how three of the other six treat their governors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRhode Island doesn&rsquo;t have a mansion -- and probably doesn&rsquo;t need one. You can drive across the state in an hour, said Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for the governor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIdaho had a governor&rsquo;s residence, then didn&rsquo;t, then did again when one was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/us/16idaho.html\">donated</a> by a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/business/28simplot.html\">billionaire potato magnate</a>. Gov. C.L. &quot;Butch&quot; Otter had been receiving a monthly housing allowance of more than $4,000. But Otter stopped taking the money in March 2009 when the 7,400-square-foot <a href=\"http://www.governorshouse.idaho.gov/\">Idaho House</a> became available and he opted to continue commuting from his ranch, his spokesman said.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tCalifornia&rsquo;s governors are on their own, because the state doesn&rsquo;t provide a residence or a housing allowance, said Joe Wolfenden, senior guide at the <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=498\">California Governor&rsquo;s Mansion</a>. Now a state park destination, the mansion was last used by a governor in 1967, when Ronald Reagan lived there for three months before moving to a home that had been purchased by friends.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK, let&rsquo;s bring all this mansion talk home.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn calling on Governor-elect Scott Walker to save taxpayer dollars, state Sen. Bob Wirch said selling or leasing the governor&rsquo;s mansion would enable the state to cut more than $1 million over four years on the cost of operating the mansion.
