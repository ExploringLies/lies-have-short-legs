We sorted the data using the <a href=\"http://www.murderdata.org/p/blog-page.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Murder Accountability Project</u></a>, which mines the FBI data. The most recent data is from 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 1,470 homicides reported in St. Louis from 2004-14. Of those, 795 were &quot;cleared.&quot; A cleared offense occurs when at least one person is &quot;arrested, charged with commission the arrest, and turned over to the court for prosecution (whether following arrest, court summons, or police notice),&quot; <a href=\"https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_cleared/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to the FBI&rsquo;s website</u></a>. All three of those requirements must be met for an offense to be considered cleared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, a little over 54 percent of homicides were &quot;cleared&quot; in St. Louis between 2004 and 2014. That&rsquo;s in line with what Hanaway said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ll note two caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, there is a technical difference between homicide and murder. James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University said that murder is more restrictive term, and homicide includes any killing of a person, even an execution by the state. With murder, there is intent to cause bodily harm, however he said the terms are used interchangeably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking this into account, the number Hanaway is touting may be a little different from the data, but David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay&nbsp;College of Criminal Justice, said using the word murder in place of homicide is &quot;completely mainstream.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe height=\"600\" src=\"http://public.tableau.com/shared/7ZRYQK3T8?:display_count=yes&#10;?:embed=yes&amp;:tabs=yes&amp;:toolbar=yes\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These terms are used so interchangeably that often the formal authorities don&rsquo;t even make the distinction.&quot; Kennedy said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, Kennedy also said the rate of unsolved criminal homicides is &quot;shockingly high&quot; in many cities,<strong> </strong>so the situation in St. Louis is not all that unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanaway said &quot;only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s basically accurate looking at FBI data from 2004-14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5682c82-966a-4646-90d4-df304162a1ac\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5682c82-966a-4646-90d4-df304162a1ac</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-14T12:51:36.380093", "ruling_date": "2016-06-14T16:05:57", "ruling_headline": "Missouri candidate says only half of murders in St. Louis get solved", "ruling_headline_slug": "hanaway-right-about-how-many-murder-get-solved-st-", "ruling_link_text": "Data from 2004-14 supports this", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://fox2now.com/2016/06/06/republican-gubernatorial-candidates-debate-at-fox2/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Republican Governor Debate</u></a>,<em> &quot;</em>Fox2now&quot;<em>, </em>June 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Jennifer Joyce, Circuit Attorney for the city of St. Louis, June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, James Alan Fox, professor of criminology at Northeastern University, June 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, June 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Hanaway&rsquo;s Policy director Will Scharf, June 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data, <a href=\"http://www.murderdata.org/p/blog-page.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Murder Accountability Project&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FBI, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Uniformed Crime Reports&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Schron Jackson, St. Louis Police Department Public Information Manager, June 9, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Candidate for governor of Missouri", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Catherine", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Missouri", "id": 3447, "last_name": "Hanaway", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "catherine-hanaway", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Hanaway_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Missouri", "edition": "Missouri", "edition_slug": "missouri", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 51, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Missouri Truth-O-meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/51/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3447/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://hanawayforgovernor.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Only half of the murders in the city of St. Louis get solved.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Missouri", "statement_date": "2016-06-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Are only half the murders in St. Louis solved?"}
