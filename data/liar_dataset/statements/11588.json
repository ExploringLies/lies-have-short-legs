Those researchers found that drinking &nbsp;champagne might counteract age-related memory loss and help delay the onset of degenerative brain disorders, such as dementia, according to a press release at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rats, not humans, were subjects in the research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For reasons still unclear, the study&rsquo;s headline findings went viral on social media and cracked Facebook&rsquo;s list of trending topics this month, nearly three years after the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Three glasses of champagne &lsquo;could help Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease&rsquo;&quot; was the headline on The United Kingdom&rsquo;s Evening Standard&rsquo;s Facebook post Nov. 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News outlets picked the story up from social media. Most but not all pointed out that the study was not brand new. The attention prompted Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service (NHS) to issue a statement Nov. 9, declaring that there&rsquo;s &quot;no hard evidence champagne can prevent dementia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency explained that the University of Reading&rsquo;s 2013 study was small &mdash; it involved three groups of eight rats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>n a six-week period, the rats had champagne, non-champagne alcoholic drink, or an alcohol-free drink. Each rat was assessed on its ability to find treats in a maze before and after this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main finding: rats given champagne were better at remembering how to find the treat than those given the alcohol-free drink. They found the treats roughly five times out of eight, compared with four times out of eight in rats given the other drinks, NHS said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency recommended that the study be repeated with a larger sample of rats and pointed out that &quot;this research has limited direct applicability to humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fact that rats may have performed slightly better in a maze, or demonstrated some protein changes related to nerve adaptability, does not mean champagne definitely reduces the risk of dementia in humans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ginny Helms, vice president of chapter services and public policy for the Georgia chapter of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, said the 2013 study was very limited &quot;and not at all conclusive on how champagne or other forms of alcohol can help prevent Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No one should drink champagne or other alcohol as a method of reducing the risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or other dementia based on this study,&quot; she said. &quot;Some studies have found that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but other studies had contradictory results.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Absent a cure or major breakthrough, the association suggests a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, socialization and exercise of the mind as the best way to protect the brain, Helms said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing critical numbers, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, also is highly recommended, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buzz on champagne started just days before the association released a major report that includes some staggering statistics on the rising financial burden to states of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Medicaid programs in 11 states &mdash; New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan and North Carolina &ndash; pay more than $1 billion a year on individuals 65 and older living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and other forms of dementia, the association reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward 10 years to 2025, and the association estimates that 20 states &mdash; Georgia included &mdash; will be in this boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementia costs the Peach State&rsquo;s Medicaid program $989 million this year. But, in 10 years, costs are expected to increase 61 percent to $1.59 billion by the association&rsquo;s estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media recently resurrected an old study Stories were posted &nbsp;suggesting that drinking champagne could help prevent the onset of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and other forms of dementia. The study is from 2013, not new, as some posts suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was based on testing in a small group of rats, which the National Health Service in Britain says would need to be repeated in a larger sample. And it still might not have any implications in humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To imply otherwise is very misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-17T18:12:26.288800", "ruling_date": "2015-11-17T06:55:18", "ruling_headline": "Here's a toast to some very bad information on booze and dementia ", "ruling_headline_slug": "heres-toast-some-very-bad-information-booze-and-de", "ruling_link_text": "Alzheimer's a major public health concern", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;Scientists reveal <a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR503596.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>drinking</u></a> champagne could improve memory,&quot; press release, University of Reading, May 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No hard evidence <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2015/11November/Pages/No-hard-evidence-champagne-can-prevent-dementia.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>champagne</u></a> can prevent dementia,&quot; NHS United Kingdom, Monday, Nov. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Drinking three glasses of <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/drinking-three-glasses-champagne-per-6796278\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>champagne</u></a> per week could help stave off dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s disease,&quot; Daily Mirror, Nov. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Ginny Helms, vice president of chapter services and public policy for the Georgia chapter of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/16/will-drinking-champagne-stop-me-getting-dementia\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>drinking</u></a> champagne stop me getting dementia?
