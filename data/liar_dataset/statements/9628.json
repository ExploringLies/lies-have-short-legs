On her website, she claimed that the law &quot;already has caused millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance and have their well-being and financial health threatened.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hadn&rsquo;t heard that statistic before and wondered if it could be correct that -- in a state with about 8 million people -- &quot;millions&quot; had already lost their insurance because of the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Comstock&rsquo;s campaign for proof and were told it made an error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our website said &lsquo;Virginians&rsquo; when it should have read &lsquo;Americans&rsquo;,&quot; Johanna Persing, the communications director for Comstock&rsquo;s campaign, emailed. Comstock changed the wording on her site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that millions of Americans in the individual market -- those who purchase health insurance themselves or are covered by small employers -- were notified last fall that their policies were being discontinued because they don&rsquo;t fulfill minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one could say exactly how many policies were cancelled, but media reports estimated the number was at least 4 million. The embarrassed White House offered a fix that allowed many of the disqualified plans to exist for another year. Some people were moved to a different plan by their insurance companies or got coverage on state exchanges created by the health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Comstock&rsquo;s original claim raises an interesting question: How many Virginians received notices last year that their policies were ending?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virginia doesn&rsquo;t keep those figures, said Ken Schrad, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doug Gray, the executive director with the Virginia Association of Health Plans, estimates 850,000 Virginians who bought their plans individually or got coverage through a small employer were notified their plans were discontinued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gray stressed, however, that those people were given a choice to switch to a new plan or to renew their original policy for another year. A majority of them chose to keep their original policy through this year, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comstock&rsquo;s website said that millions of Virginians lost their health insurance because of Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her campaign acknowledged it erred and, after our inquiry, changed its site to say millions of &quot;Americans&quot; lost their health insurance. While we applaud the campaign&rsquo;s admission of a mistake, that does not unplug the Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no exact count on how many Virginians were notified last year that their plans would be ended because of Obamacare. A state health insurance lobbyist estimates the number at 850,000. But these people still had options; they or their employer could renew their old plans for another year or switch to new coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Comstock&rsquo;s claim about millions of Virginians losing coverage was unfounded and we rate it False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-20T00:45:06.119326", "ruling_date": "2014-07-20T00:42:07", "ruling_headline": "Barbara Comstock said millions of Virginians lost insurance because of Obamacare ", "ruling_headline_slug": "barbara-comstock-said-millions-virginians-lost-ins", "ruling_link_text": "Wrong and retracted", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Barbara Comstock for Congress website, accessed July 7, 2014 and July 9, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail from Johanna Persing, communications director for Barbara Comstock&rsquo;s congressional campaign, July 9, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RAND Corporation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rand.org/blog/2014/04/survey-estimates-net-gain-of-9-3-million-american-adults.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Survey estimates net gain of 9.3 million Americans with health insurance,&quot; </u></a>April 8, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Christine Eibner, senior economist at the RAND Corporation, July 15, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews with Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Assocation of Health Plans, July 16-18, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail from Doug Gray, July 17, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Ken Schrad, spokesman for the Virginia State Corporation Commission, July 17, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christopher Conover, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/10/30/no-david-axelrod-the-vast-majority-of-people-in-this-country-are-not-keeping-their-plan/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;No, David Axelrod, &lsquo;the vast majority of people in this country&rsquo; are not keeping their plan,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 30, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/12/31/stunning-new-report-undermines-central-gop-obamacare-claim/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;Stunning new report undermines central GOP Obamacare claim,&quot;</u></a> Dec. 31, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;Lie of the year: If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,&rsquo;&quot;</u></a> Dec. 12, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/article/2014/mar/09/upon-reconsideration-cantors-2012-obamacare-statem/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;Upon reconsideration, Cantor&rsquo;s 2012 Obamacare claim still doesn&rsquo;t hold up,&quot;</u></a> March 9, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/06/glenn-beck/beck-says-obama-knew-50-americans-would-lose-healt/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Glenn Beck says Barack Obama knew that 50% of Americans would lose health insurance,&quot;</u></a> Nov. 4, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Associated Press, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/policy-notifications-current-status-state-204701399.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Policy notifications and current status, by state,&quot;</u></a> Dec. 26, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post Fact Checker, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/17/boehners-claim-that-obamacare-has-resulted-in-a-net-loss-of-people-with-health-insurance/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Boehner&rsquo;s claim that Obamacare has resulted in a &lsquo;net loss&rsquo; of people with health insurance,&quot;</u></a> March 17, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/18/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-more-people-are-uninsured-obamac/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;John Boeher says more people are uninsured since Obamacare took effect,&quot;</u></a> March 18, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/05/the-gop-says-obamacare-will-cancel-80-100-million-plans-nope/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;The GOP says Obamacare will cancel 80-100 million insurance plans.
