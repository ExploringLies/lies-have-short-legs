Rick Scott had a &quot;terrible 2013,&quot; says the Florida Democratic Party in a year-end <a href=\"http://www.rickscotts2013.com/\">video </a>bashing the Republican leader who faces voters next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democrats unveiled a long list of attacks, most of which were recycled from earlier attacks or news articles. But this one in particular caught our eye:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This fall Scott even backed the federal shutdown that cost Floridians millions each day and pushed America to the brink of default.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to check if Scott, the self-described jobs governor, backed the October shutdown that furloughed hundreds of thousands of employees. Some House Republicans had hoped to use a shutdown to delay or defund the federal health care law, but that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Scott said</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott didn&rsquo;t get a vote on the federal shutdown so the only way to judge whether he &quot;backed&quot; it is by reading his words. We reviewed statements Scott made in news releases and to the media about the shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and ended Oct. 16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Scott repeatedly bashed Obama and praised the way that Florida had handled its own finances, but he avoided taking a stance in favor or against the shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sept. 30 Scott issued a<a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/governor-rick-scott-president-obama-is-failing-floridians-with-federal-government-shutdown-2/\"> news release</a> that stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The impending federal government shutdown represents a failure of leadership. One of the most basic functions of governing is budgeting. At the state level, we compromise and negotiate to create a balanced budget every year. But, President Obama has shown no interest in negotiating or compromising. We have paid down state debt in Florida by $3.5 billion and paid back another $3.5 billion federal loan over the last two and a half years while also cutting taxes.&quot; (We should note that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jan/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-hits-charlie-crist-state-debt/\">state debt </a>is a very different animal than federal debt, and states are prohibited from running annual budget deficits.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to that news release, a Scott spokeswoman sent us a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FLGovScott/status/385456478737281025\">few</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FLGovScott/status/385455994957885440\">tweets</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FLGovScott/status/385455471231913984\">by</a> Scott (&quot;The buck stops with the President. We need leadership now,&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\">@BarackObama</a> and Congress should not take pay for every day of shutdown&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of those tweets shed much light on whether he thought shutting down the government was a good idea or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a news conference Oct. 9, Scott <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2013/10/scott-wont-answer-if-he-supports-or-opposes-federal-partial-shutdown.html\">refused to answer</a> questions about whether he agreed with Republicans in Washington who tied the budget to delaying or defunding Obamacare:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What I agree with is the fact that the buck stops with the president,&quot; Scott said. &quot;It&#39;s disappointing he doesn&#39;t know how to compromise and negotiate to get a budget done. I&#39;ve done it for three sessions....&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, Scott&rsquo;s chief of staff announced that Florida would <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/gov-rick-scott-orders-florida-agencies-not-to-keep-federal-programs-afloat/2146577\">not use state funds</a> to temporarily backfill federal programs. At the time, there was mounting criticism that the shutdown which closed federal parks was a blow to the fishing and tourism industry in the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/oct/07/tweets/did-obama-shut-down-ocean-part-shutdown/\">Keys</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 16, Obama signed a bill that ended the shutdown. Scott <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/2013/10/17/gov-scott-our-nations-leaders-have-their-heads-in-the-sand-about-our-economic-future/\">criticized</a> the fact that it wasn&#39;t a long-term agreement on debt and said that &quot;our nation&rsquo;s leaders have their heads in the sand about our economic future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party pointed to two blog posts -- from the <em><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rick-scott-attacks-barack-obamas-leadership-over-likely-government-shutdown/2144709\">Tampa Bay Times</a></em> and the <em><a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/politics/2013-10-17/story/poltijax-scott-blasts-federal-budget-deal\">Florida Times-Union</a></em> -- that stated Scott&rsquo;s position on the shutdown aligned him with congressional Republicans and pointed to Scott&rsquo;s repeated criticism of Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s true that Scott did put blame on Obama, a review of Scott&rsquo;s actual statements shows that he appeared to dodge the question of whether he supported or opposed the shutdown as a political tactic. Instead, Scott used the shutdown as a chance to criticize Obama and call for reducing federal spending and debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One final note: The Florida Democratic Party also said the shutdown would &quot;cost Floridians millions each day.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial analysts at Moody&rsquo;s estimated the shutdown cost the economy about $20 billion in direct and indirect effects, or roughly $4 per day for every man, woman and child in America. Based on Florida&rsquo;s population of about 19 million, that translates to about $77 million per day in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s fair to say that the shutdown cost Floridians as economic agents and as taxpayers millions per day,&quot; Moody&rsquo;s economist Brian Kessler said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Democratic Party said that Scott &quot;backed the federal shutdown.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott used the October shutdown as an opportunity to tout the state&rsquo;s fiscal management and wag his finger at Obama. But a review of Scott&rsquo;s statements about the shutdown shows that he dodged taking a clear stand favoring or opposing the shutdown itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-17T11:33:42.220197", "ruling_date": "2013-12-18T11:03:15", "ruling_headline": "Did Rick Scott back the federal government shutdown?", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-back-federal-shutdown-florida-democra", "ruling_link_text": "Scott bashed Obama but dodged endorsing the shutdown", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Florida Democratic Party video, <a href=\"http://www.rickscotts2013.com/\">&quot;Rick Scott&rsquo;s terrible 2013,&quot;</a> December 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/05/3671870/scotts-obama-bashing-is-warm.html\">&quot;Gov.
