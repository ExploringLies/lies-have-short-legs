Marco Rubio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an Aug. 4 interview with Southern Baptist Convention President Russell Moore, Rubio joined other Republicans in criticizing Planned Parenthood amid the release of videos by an anti-abortion group that accuse the group of harvesting <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/aug/05/politifact-sheet-8-things-know-about-plan-national/\">fetal tissue for profit</a>. A day earlier, Florida&rsquo;s Republican senator had been among those who <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-votes-to-defund-planned-parenthood-nelson-votes-against/2239834\">voted</a> to defund Planned Parenthood, a measure that failed to get the required 60 votes to advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his interview, Rubio raised concerns about nationwide access to abortions for minors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The idea that a minor can go get a tattoo,&quot; he said, before quickly correcting himself to say &quot;cannot get a tattoo without parental consent -- but can get an abortion without parental consent -- is just mind-shattering for the vast majority of Americans. ... People who believe that a young child, a minor, should be able to get an abortion easier than a tattoo -- they are the extremists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check whether minors need their parents&rsquo; permission to get a tattoo, but don&rsquo;t need permission to get an abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Parental consent laws</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the laws about parental consent for abortion and tattoos vary from state to state, so it&rsquo;s not possible to make a blanket statement as Rubio did and apply it to the whole country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to data through March 2015 compiled by the <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/tattooing-and-body-piercing.aspx\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, at least 45 states have laws prohibiting minors from getting tattoos, with the majority of those states allowing it if there&rsquo;s parental consent. For example, Florida law requires written, notarized consent of a minor&#39;s parent or legal guardian in order to tattoo a minor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at whether minors need their parents&rsquo; permission to obtain an abortion. There are two different categories of parental involvement: one is consent, which means a parent has to sign off on the abortion, while the other one is simply notification which can mean the parent receives a letter or a phone call about the abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PIMA.pdf\">Guttmacher Institute</a>, a group that tracks abortion policy and statistics, a majority of states require consent and/or notification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 38 states, minors either have to get consent and/or notify their parents, while in 12 states they don&rsquo;t need either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, which states require parental consent for a tattoo but not for an abortion. Using information from <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/parental-consent-notification-laws\">Planned Parenthood </a>about abortion laws and the <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/tattooing-and-body-piercing.aspx\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> about tattoo laws, Conant pointed to seven states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>State</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Abortion law for minors</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Tattoo law for minors</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>California</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>No parental involvement required</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>It is a misdemeanor to tattoo anyone under age 18.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Connecticut</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>No parental involvement required</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Requires permission of parent or guardian.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Hawaii</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>No parental involvement required</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Requires written consent of parent or guardian</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Maine</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>No parental involvement required</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>It is illegal to tattoo anyone under age 18.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Montana</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>No parental involvement required</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Requires explicit in-person consent of the child&#39;s parent or guardian.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>New York</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>No parental involvement required</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>It is unlawful to tattoo the body of a child less than 18 years old.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Vermont</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>No parental involvement required</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Requires written consent of his or her parent or guardian.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources: Planned Parenthood and the National Conference of State Legislatures</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conant included two states that flat-out ban tattoos for minors: California and Maine.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states may not give parents an absolute veto over whether their daughters have an abortion,<strong> </strong>37 states that require parental involvement include a &quot;judicial bypass&quot; procedure. This allows a minor to receive court approval for an abortion without her parents&rsquo; knowledge or consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use of judicial bypass could increase the number of states where Rubio&rsquo;s scenario would be valid. A spokeswoman for Americans United for Life, told PolitiFact that &quot;even in states with the most stringent parental consent requirements, a minor who can demonstrate (with the assistance of free counsel) to a court that she is either mature enough to make an abortion decision, or that obtaining parental consent is not in her best interest, can bypass the parental consent requirement.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that, despite the existence of judicial bypass, a majority of pregnant minors who seek abortion report that their parents are aware that they are doing so, according to a <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ParentalInvolvementLaws.pdf\">literature review</a> by Guttmacher in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helena Silverstein, a government and law professor at Lafayette College who wrote a book in 2007:<em> &quot;Girls on the Stand: How Courts Fail Pregnant Minors,&quot;</em> suggested that rather than compare parental consent for tattoos to abortion, it is more useful to compare other <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OMCL.pdf\">minors&rsquo; consent law</a> as they relate to sexual and reproductive health. All states allow minors to consent to get treatment for sexually transmitted infections while 32 states allow minors to consent to prenatal care without their parents&rsquo; permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J. Shoshanna Ehrlich, an expert on reproductive rights at the University of Massachusetts, was also skeptical of Rubio&rsquo;s comparison.<strong> </strong>While it &quot;must suck to be 16 and wait until you are 18 to get a tattoo, you can postpone the decision,&quot; unlike abortion, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said &quot;a minor cannot get a tattoo without parental consent but can get an abortion without parental consent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio has a good argument for about 11 states, but that&rsquo;s a minority. More commonly, parents by law need to be at least notified -- and in many cases give their consent -- for a minor to have an abortion. There is a significant exception, however: 37 states allow a&nbsp;minor to go through a judge without notifying parents. As for tattoos, most states either ban them for minors or require parental consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-05T16:39:07.192115", "ruling_date": "2015-08-13T11:01:05", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio says a minor can get an abortion -- but not a tattoo -- without parental consent", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-says-minor-can-get-abortion-not-tattoo", "ruling_link_text": "Most states require parental consent or notification for abortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/aug/05/politifact-sheet-8-things-know-about-plan-national/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;8 things to know about the Planned Parenthood controversy,&quot;</u></a> Aug. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guttmacher Institute,<a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PIMA.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;Parental involvement in minors&rsquo; abortions,&quot;</u></a> Aug. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guttmacher Institute, <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OMCL.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;An overview of minors&rsquo; consent law,&quot; </u></a>Aug. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guttmacher Institute, <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ParentalInvolvementLaws.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;The impact of laws requiring parental notification for abortion: a literature review,&quot;</u></a> March 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood, <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/parental-consent-notification-laws\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Parental Consent and Notification Laws</u></a>, Accessed Aug. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perspectives on Sex and Reproductive Health journal article by Ted Joyce, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951271/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Parental consent for abortion and the judicial bypass option in Arkansas: effects and correlates,&quot; </u></a>2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em> The Buzz blog, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-votes-to-defund-planned-parenthood-nelson-votes-against/2239834\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Rubio votes to defund Planned Parenthood, Bill Nelson votes against,&quot; </u></a>Aug. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/aug/05/politifact-sheet-8-things-know-about-plan-national/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;PolitiFact Sheet: 8 things to know about the Planned Parenthood controversy,&quot;</u></a> Aug. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/aug/07/marco-rubio/rubio-said-hes-never-advocated-abortion-exceptions/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;Rubio said he&rsquo;s never advocated for abortion exceptions for rape or incest,&quot;</u></a> Aug. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Ted Joyce, Baruch College at City University of New York Professor of Economics and Finance and Research Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, Aug. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Helena Silverstein, a government and law professor at Lafayette College and author of book: <em>&quot;Girls on the Stand: How Courts Fail Pregnant Minors,&quot; </em>Aug. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, J.
