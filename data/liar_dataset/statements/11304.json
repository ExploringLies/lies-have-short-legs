Marco Rubio top the tracking poll, with Gallup noting Bush&rsquo;s favorability jumped as Trump&rsquo;s fell this summer, undermining the theory that Trump is hurting the other candidates in the race with Hispanics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallup&rsquo;s survey is based on interviews with about 650 Hispanics from July 8 to Aug. 23 with a margin of error of 5 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no outlier.

However, most Hispanic registered voters lean toward the Democratic Party, with the Republican share accounting for about 25 percent, said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic polling at the Pew Research Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more relevant figure to this discussion is how <em>Republican</em> Hispanic registered voters feel about Trump compared to other candidates, Lopez said, since it is their vote that will influence the GOP state primaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with that is Republican Hispanic voters have not been queried as much as the broader electorate this early in the election cycle. Doing this well requires hiring Spanish speakers for interviews, randomly surveying households and asking respondents if they consider themselves Hispanic or Latino, and then making sure at least half of the respondents are reached by cell phone, Lopez said, reflecting Hispanic household trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some pollsters try to get at this through micro-sampling their larger pool of poll respondents, but the results are often meaningless because the sample is so small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Economist/</em>YouGov poll, for example, asked voters who identify as Republican to choose their preferred GOP nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broken down by race/ethnicity, 28 percent of GOP-leaning Hispanic voters chose Trump, followed by &quot;no preference&quot; at 18 percent, and Bush at 15 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem with running away with those results and proclaiming Trump the favorite: Just 34 Hispanic adults answered the question. Put another way, that means 10 people chose Trump, six said they had no preference, and five chose Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No self-respecting statistician would say this tiny sample reflects the sentiment of all registered Hispanic Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the higher support for Trump makes sense, since he also posts higher name recognition than the other candidates. Only 9 percent of the larger pool of Hispanic voters said they did not know how they felt about Trump, compared to 22 percent for Bush and 24 percent for Rubio. The numbers were much higher for the rest of the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A state poll?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Google search shows where Bachmann might be going with her erroneous claim. <a href=\"http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/07/16/nevada-state-polling-shows-donald-trump-crushing-field-including-massive-support-from-latinos/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Some</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/07/breaking-poll-donald-trump-leads-all-gop-candidates-with-hispanic-voters/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>blogs</u></a> crowed about a <a href=\"http://www.oann.com/trump-leads-nevada-poll-with-overwhelming-hispanic-support/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll by Gravis Marketing for the conservative One America News Network</u></a> that found &quot;Trump leads Nevada poll with overwhelming Hispanic support.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hispanic population is small in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the first three states to hold presidential caucuses or primaries next year, but that&rsquo;s not true for Nevada, which goes fourth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 31 percent of Hispanic respondents said they would vote for Trump in a Republican primary, followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 11.4 percent, according to OAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this might sound good for Trump (and Bachmann), they shouldn&rsquo;t read too much into the poll&rsquo;s declarations. As <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/media/donald-trump-talks-a-big-game-but-how-much-of-it-is-true/4/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CBS News</u></a> pointed out when Trump made reference to&nbsp;this poll, the OAN poll is based on robocalling, which means a computer talked with respondents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This method is not as reliable, and it&rsquo;s more problematic for reaching Hispanic residents &mdash; half of whom rely only on cell phones (higher than for African-Americans and whites). Robocalls to cell phone numbers are not permitted by federal regulators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also not clear if the poll included a Spanish-speaking component, Lopez said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One last red flag: The poll&rsquo;s details do not show how many Hispanics were asked the question from the sample of 620 registered Republicans. So we don&rsquo;t know how many Hispanic Republican voters chose Trump. (Remember how much a handful of responses from Hispanic adults made Hispanic support for Trump appear in the YouGov poll?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Lopez said the Hispanic Republican registered voter results seem to align with the view of Republicans overall in that poll, &quot;and I doubt the 31.4 percent for Hispanics is statistically different from the 27.7 percent of all Republican registered voters&quot; in Nevada who said they would vote for Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachmann said Trump&rsquo;s polling numbers show that he&rsquo;s &quot;the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t even have to crack open the history books of all Hispanic support for all Republicans ever to disprove her claim. Trump sits &mdash; and in many cases, firmly &mdash; at the bottom of favorability polls among Hispanics compared to the other GOP candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-15T11:26:05.310983", "ruling_date": "2015-09-15T12:13:47", "ruling_headline": "Michele Bachmann: Donald Trump is 'the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been'", "ruling_headline_slug": "michele-bachmann-donald-trump-highest-hispanics-an", "ruling_link_text": "No national poll shows this", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Wall Street Journal,</em> &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hispanics-hold-dim-view-of-donald-trump-poll-finds-1438599600\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hispanics hold dim view of Donald Trump, poll finds</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whmcZAXZLnk\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>David Brock, Michele Bachmann on Trump and Clinton, with Don Lemon 9/10</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallup, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/184814/hispanics-frown-trump-not-rest-gop-field.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hispanics Frown on Trump, but Not Rest of GOP Field</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"http://v\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Trump&rsquo;s support spikes among Republicans,</u></a>&quot; July 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Mark Hugo Lopez, Pew Research Center director of Hispanic polling, Sept. 11, 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Karlyn Bowman, American Enterprise Institute polling expert, Sept. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with William Jordan, YouGov spokesman, Sept. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Univision, <a href=\"http://corporate.univision.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/July-2015-Univision-Noticias-Poll-Results.jpg\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Destino 2016: A survey of the Latino Vote</u></a>; A bipartisan poll of the Hispanic electorate,&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Economist/YouGov <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/k24hv9t9fv/econTabReport.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll</u></a>, Aug. 28-Sept. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/07/26/donald-trump-hispanics-mexico-latinos-republican-voters/30697991/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump on track to win GOP Hispanic vote: Column</u></a>,&quot; July 27, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Congresswoman", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "Michele", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Minnesota", "id": 149, "last_name": "Bachmann", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "michele-bachmann", "pants_count": 16, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bachmann_mug_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/149/", "total_count": 61, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://bachmann.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Donald Trump&rsquo;s polling numbers show that he&rsquo;s &quot;the highest with Hispanics that any Republican has ever been.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on CNN", "statement_date": "2015-09-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 194, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/194/", "subject": "Polls and Public Opinion", "subject_slug": "polls", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
