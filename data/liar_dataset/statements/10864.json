Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, who spearheaded the bill, said about 85 percent of the hotel guests who pay the fee will be from outside Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This shifts some of the burden to visitors who will have to share the costs to modernize the transportation network in Georgia,&quot; said Roberts, now a planning director for the state Department of Transportation, during floor debate on the final bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s hospitality industry, though, was blindsided by the last-minute addition of the fee and has claimed it will hurt business and Georgians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Georgia Convention and Visitors Bureau points to a survey of hoteliers that shows about a third of leisure guests are in-state tourists. Those people will already be paying an average of 6 cents more a gallon for gas when the law takes effect July 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So who is right? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, remember we already checked a claim that the fee will hurt Georgia&rsquo;s convention business by adding extra costs for large groups coming to the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ruled <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1awev7y\">Mostly True</a> with a caveat: There is nothing that says the new fee must be passed along to hotel guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, looking at data from Savannah-area hotels, those businesses would be better off absorbing the cost &ndash; about $18.7 million a year, based on published occupancy rates &ndash; than passing it along and potentially chasing away 7.5 percent of room nights. That would cost hotels about $22.5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if hotels pass them along to guests, where are those folks from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberts said he cited his figure based on memory of lawmakers&rsquo; debates on funding for the new Falcons stadium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I remember &hellip; that we were told that approximately 85 percent of the people that stay in the metro Atlanta motels/hotels are from out of state,&quot; Roberts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Roberts underestimated slightly. &nbsp;According to a website run by stadium advocates, 86 percent of overnight guests in the state&rsquo;s largest hotel market are from outside Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where does the Georgia CVB get its figures?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 2013 Georgia Longwood study that looked at both statewide figures as well as Atlanta, which has 94,000 of the state&rsquo;s 177,000 hotel rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report concluded 31 percent of leisure guests &ndash; that is, not including business travelers, conventioneers or people traveling with social groups like a church or school trip &ndash; were in-state travelers. For the Atlanta region, in-state travelers accounted for only 20 percent of the total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Almost half of the state&rsquo;s hotel rooms are in the Atlanta metro, so you need to look at the figures in other regions to get a more clear picture of how many Georgians are affected by this fee,&quot; said Julie Ford Musselman, head of the Georgia CVB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That picture is a bit fuzzy, given that there is no single way that regions reported where their guests were from and what kind of guests they were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hotels in the Lake Lanier area, for instance, reported based on the number of leisure and group bookings, with Georgians making up 73 percent and 56 percent, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have not done an aggregate study for every category, but looking at what we have, we can say that most definitely the $5 fee impacts Georgians more heavily than anyone realized when they passed this transportation bill,&quot; Musselman said. &quot;The ability to book business and keep our existing customer base, in every market, is our concern.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University who had helped PolitiFact Georgia with the business costs in our previous fact check, agrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, he said, the question of how the fee affects every region of the state is a salient economic point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, while the hospitality industry cannot provide verifiable answers, neither could state lawmakers before passing the bill that included the fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Atlanta, while less susceptible to the fee, could potentially see increased competition from out-of-state tourist or business spots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one can say for sure, Seaman said, because there was no study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There has not been enough careful analysis done on this,&quot; Seaman said. &quot;There are clearly going to be differential regional effects. The numbers are plausible, but we don&rsquo;t know what they will mean.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state lawmaker who helped Georgia pass a nearly $900 million bill to tackle the state&rsquo;s backlog of road and bridge work said a hotel fee in the bill would help shift the burden to out-of-state visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jay Roberts was correct with his numbers, at least in the largest hotel market in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But hoteliers have a point that the fee could hit more Georgians in the state&rsquo;s smaller cities and regions, even if the numbers vary by the type of visitors staying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberts implied the 85 percent out-of-state figure was statewide, even if his citation was clearly only for metro Atlanta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was accurate, but the statistic needs more information to be fully understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-21T15:03:04.251272", "ruling_date": "2015-05-25T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Will out-of-staters or Georgians pay most of the new hotel fee?", "ruling_headline_slug": "will-out-staters-or-georgians-pay-most-new-hotel-f", "ruling_link_text": "Answer varies by region", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Georgia Public Broadcasting, 2015 Legislative session, <a href=\"http://www.gpb.org/lawmakers/2015/day-39\"><strong>House Day 39</strong></a>, (PM session), March 31, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Department of Audits,<a href=\"http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/news/documents/2015/04/14/SenateFiscalNote.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><strong><u>Senate Revised Fiscal Note on HB 170</u></strong></a>, March 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/georgias-hotel-industry-fights-new-5-fees/nk3Kk/\"><strong>Nightly charge could impact state&#39;s tourism, industry warns leaders,</strong></a>&quot; April 27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WABE radio, &quot;<a href=\"http://wabe.org/post/added-fee-ga-hotels-may-cause-drop-business-some-fear\"><strong>Added Fee at Ga.
