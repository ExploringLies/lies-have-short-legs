However, there is no evidence that Trump responded with her own threat against former President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yournewswire.com cites an article in the Washington <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/national-security/isis-calls-assassination-barron-trump/\">Free Beacon</a>, which stated that pro-ISIS internet channels called for the assassination of the son of Melania and President Donald Trump. The Free Beacon attributed the information to the <a href=\"https://www.memri.org/reports/jihad-and-terrorism-threat-monitor-jttm-weekend-summary-277\">Middle East Media Research Institute</a>, an organization that tracks jihadist propaganda. The institute found the information about the threat against Barron on Telegram, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-app-of-choice-for-jihadists-isis-seizes-on-internet-tool-to-promote-terror/2016/12/23/a8c348c0-c861-11e6-85b5-76616a33048d_story.html?utm_term=.81e97edbd42a\">social media network</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what the group reported:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>On November 21, 2017, a supporter of the Islamic State (ISIS) on Telegram called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location. Using the hashtag &quot;handle the son of the mule of America,&quot; the supporter, who uses the name &quot;Dak Al-Munafiqeen,&quot; Arabic for &quot;striking the hypocrites,&quot; wrote: &quot;Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington.&quot; The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report drew <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-wants-barron-trump-dead-calls-supporters-kill-presidents-son-2618410\">scant mainstream media attention</a>. While Telegram is used by a lot of people worldwide, it is particularly popular with jihadis and ISIS supporters, said Steven Stalinsky, MEMRI executive director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s the main vehicle for ISIS and their supporters to use to communicate and put out propaganda,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The threat against Barron on Telegram from a supporter is not the equivalent of an official communique by ISIS, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fact that someone on an ISIS channel said it online doesn&rsquo;t make it a significant threat,&quot; he said. &quot;Anything said by some extremist on Telegram is not exactly breaking news that most outlets pick up in any way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the YourNewsWire.com story really goes into fake territory is the idea that Melania Trump responded to the threat by saying &quot;if ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I&rsquo;ll scratch Obama&rsquo;s eyes out.&quot; We could not find any evidence that she responded at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted YourNewsWire.com and received a reply from the editor in chief, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who said PolitiFact is &quot;policing the internet as part of a a faux moral crusade on behalf of the Clinton regime.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>YourNewsWire.com stated that Melania Trump said, &quot;If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I&rsquo;ll scratch Obama&rsquo;s eyes out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence that Melania Trump responded to an online threat against Barron at all &mdash;
