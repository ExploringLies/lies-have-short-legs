Secretary General Ban Ki-moon&rsquo;s term expires in early 2017, making Obama&rsquo;s bid for the position a possibility.&quot; Ban, the UN&rsquo;s eighth secretary-general, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/formersg/ban.shtml\">ended his term Dec. 31, 2016</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim that Obama sought to or intended to become the UN&rsquo;s secretary-general has been <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/obama-campaigns-at-west-point-to-be-united-nations-secretary-general/\">around for several years</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA NEWS&rsquo; post includes several sentences that first appeared in a Jan. 8, 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/8/l-todd-wood-netanyahu-leading-effort-thwart-obama-/\">post</a> on the Washington Times. That 2016 story attributes its information to a Kuwaiti newspaper, Al-Jarida. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Jan. 12, 2016, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/12/editorial-obama-at-the-united-nations/\">editorial</a> in the Washington Times also references the Kuwaiti newspaper, adding that &quot;rumors are floating back from the Middle East&quot; that Obama &quot;is sounding out Democrats, Republicans and friends of the United Nations in the United States to help him get the job of secretary-general of the U.N.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The editorial acknowledges that the rumors &quot;might be just another imaginative fairy tale of the Arabian night. The Arab media is addicted to such tales. But Mr. Obama was once described by Bill Clinton as a fairy tale, too, and here he is, completing his second term, and Mr. Obama does not suffer excessive modesty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2016, Israeli media also reported on the Kuwaiti newspaper&rsquo;s claim, but not without casting doubt on the information. &quot;The report, which admittedly appears somewhat far-fetched, has not been confirmed by any other news outlets and does not name any of its sources,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/206189#.VpPZOPkrKUk\">israelnationalnews.com reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UN General Assembly <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/appointment.shtml\">appoints</a> its secretary-general, on the recommendation of the Security Council.
