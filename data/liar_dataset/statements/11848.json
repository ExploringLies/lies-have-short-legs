Braddock Mayor and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman boasts that he&rsquo;s the only Pennsylvania candidate to endorse Bernie Sanders so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Reddit AMA Tuesday, one user praised Fetterman and fellow Democratic senate candidate Joe Sestak, retired Navy admiral and former U.S. congressman, for campaigns<strong> </strong>resembling Sanders&rsquo; grassroots feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m a fan of yours, but also a long time supporter of Admiral Joe. I see you as two Bernies against the one corporate party machine candidate. I wish you could team up somehow,&quot; wrote the Redditor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We already have teamed up, as I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for President,&quot; Fetterman replied. &quot; In PA, I&#39;ve got Bernie&#39;s back.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Fetterman spokesperson furthered this in email, adding that his endorsement was unique not just for the state, but nationally: A January <a href=\"http://mobile.philly.com/beta?wss=/philly/blogs/big_tent&amp;id=365301601\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Philadelphia Inquirer</u><u> article</u></a> named the Braddock mayor as &quot;the only statewide candidate nationally to endorse the Vermont senator.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was that so? We were intrigued and decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among Pennsylvania Democratic candidates for U.S. Senator, four people have declared for the April primary so far<strong>, </strong>and only Fetterman has endorsed Sanders. Katie McGinty, Gov. Tom Wolf&rsquo;s former chief of staff, is endorsing Hillary Clinton. Sestak has declined to throw support officially behind Sanders or Clinton. In response to our inquiry, a Sestak spokesman repeated a statement previously given to other press: &quot;Joe just focuses on the people of Pennsylvania so that he can continue to serve them.&quot; Wire and springs manufacturer Joseph Vodvarka from Clinton, Pa., told PolitiFact Pennsylvania that he&rsquo;s yet to endorse anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked for other Pennsylvania statewide candidates who endorsed Sanders and were unable to find any. So Fetterman&rsquo;s comments on Reddit are accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His spokesperson added that there are no other statewide candidates nationally who support Sanders, but we were able to find a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Sanders&rsquo; home state of Vermont, for example, he has at least three such endorsers: former State Senator Matt Dunne, a<strong> </strong>gubernatorial candidate; State Senator David Zuckerman, a<strong> </strong>candidate for lieutenant governor, and State Auditor Doug Hoffer, who is running to keep his office. In Iowa, Sanders supporter Tom Fiegen is running for U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Sanders has a notably low number of endorsements. Only two representatives in the U.S. Congress have endorsed Sanders, according to <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>FiveThirtyEight</u></a>, and<strong> </strong>no U.S. senators or governors have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bertram Johnson, a political science professor at Middlebury College<strong> </strong>and expert in Vermont politics, said people endorse based on three factors:<strong> </strong>probability to win, their constituents&rsquo; leanings and political connections. &quot;Endorsers are interested in someone who can support them and has supported them in the past, who&rsquo;s been an insider for decades,&quot; Johnson explained. &quot;This is obviously something that Bernie Sanders hasn&rsquo;t done, because he hasn&rsquo;t really been a Democrat until he entered this race.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know that he has a longstanding national network among politicians,&quot; he continued<strong>.</strong> &quot;I think what he&rsquo;s done a good job of is using national media, like MSNBC, to cultivate support among liberal activists.&quot; Sanders&rsquo; high tally of small contributions and a long list of Hollywood endorsements<strong> </strong>reflects this, Johnson said<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What answering questions about the Pennsylvania senate race, Fetterman said, &quot;I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. In PA, I&#39;ve got Bernie&#39;s back.&quot; We found he is the only statewide candidate in Pennsylvania who has endorsed Sanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His office later claimed he was the only statewide candidate <em>anywhere </em>to endorse Sanders. That&rsquo;s an exaggeration; statewide candidates in Vermont and Iowa have also endorsed Sanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re fact-checking Fetterman&rsquo;s original claim, however, and that statement is accurate. We rate his statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-03T12:17:27.326848", "ruling_date": "2016-02-04T13:45:00", "ruling_headline": "Fetterman says he's the only senate candidate backing Sanders in PA", "ruling_headline_slug": "fetterman-says-he-only-senate-candidate-backing-sa", "ruling_link_text": "Claim on Reddit proves correct", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>News article, <a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/off-mic/90057-us-senate-candidate-fetterman-goes-for-bernie\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;</u><u>U.S. Senate candidate Fetterman goes for Bernie,&quot;</u></a> Newsworks, Jan. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Joseph Vodvarka, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate for Pennsylvania, Feb. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email and telephone interview, Bertram Johnson, Associate Professor of Political Science, Feb. 2-3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, <a href=\"http://vtdigger.org/2015/06/12/vermonts-elected-progressives-endorse-sanders-for-president/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Vermont&rsquo;s elected progressives endorse Sanders for president,&quot;</u></a> VTDigger, Jun. 12, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, <a href=\"http://vtdigger.org/2015/10/27/matt-dunne-endorses-bernie-sanders-for-president/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Matt Dunne endorses Bernie Sanders for president,&quot;</u></a> VTDigger, Oct. 27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reddit page, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennsylvania/comments/43pzhr/hi_im_john_fetterman_mayor_of_braddock_pa/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">hi, I&#39;m John Fetterman &mdash; Mayor of Braddock, PA &amp; candidate for U.S. Senate. ask me anything!</a>&quot; Reddit, Feb. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News data visualization, <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/#endorsements\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;The Endorsement Primary,&quot;</u></a> FiveThirtyEight, ongoing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/11/tom-fiegen-bernie-sanders-biggest-ally-and-candidate-for-u-s-senate/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;</u><u>Tom Fiegen: Bernie Sanders&rsquo; Biggest Ally and Candidate for U.S. Senate,&quot;</u></a> The New York Observer, Nov. 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Mayor of Braddock", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "PA - Pennsylvania", "id": 3379, "last_name": "Fetterman", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "john-fetterman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/fetterman.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Pennsylvania", "edition": "Pennsylvania", "edition_slug": "pennsylvania", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 54, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Pennsylvania Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/54/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3379/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "https://johnfetterman.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&nbsp;&quot;I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for President.
