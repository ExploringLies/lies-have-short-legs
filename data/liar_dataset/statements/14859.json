It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense why someone from the city&rsquo;s vote is so much more important to Democrats, who swear they aren&rsquo;t at all racist.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article stated that Hannity made those comments on Dana Loesch&rsquo;s show <em>Guns&nbsp;God and Grits</em>. A Fox News spokeswoman told PolitiFact that Hannity did not make the statement and Loesch, who hosts a conservative radio show, told PolitiFact that she hadn&rsquo;t had Hannity on her show in a few years and doesn&rsquo;t have a show with that name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Revolution website linked to the Facebook page for Special News USA.
