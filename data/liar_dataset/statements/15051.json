Trump continued in that interview to say, &quot;It&#39;s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should&#39;ve won.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That statement earned him <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/12/2017-lie-year-russian-election-interference-made-s/\">PolitiFact&rsquo;s 2017 Lie of the Year</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2017, when reports of Russian-backed Facebook ads came out, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/911179462745710593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Flawfareblog.com%2Frealnews-trump-et-laffaire-russe-resource-page\">tweeted</a>, &quot;The Russia hoax continues, now it&#39;s ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When the <em>Washington Post</em> reported in December 2016 that the CIA had concluded that the Russians wanted to boost Trump&rsquo;s chances, Trump rejected it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,&quot; he said on <em><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/12/11/exclusive-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks-transition-process.html\">Fox News Sunday</a></em> on Dec. 11, 2016. &quot;I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She&rsquo;s down to a very low number. No, I don&rsquo;t believe that at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://time.com/4591183/time-person-of-the-year-2016-donald-trump-interview/\">December 2016 interview</a> with <em>Time</em>, Trump said two things: He didn&rsquo;t think Russia meddled, and that it might have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t believe they interfered,&quot; Trump said. &quot;That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say &lsquo;oh, Russia interfered.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a moment later he said, &quot;I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During an overseas trip to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-gaggle-aboard-air-force-one-en-route-hanoi-vietnam/\">Asia in November 2017</a>, Trump spoke of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A reporter asked how Trump brought up the issue of Russian meddling in the U.S. election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every time he sees me, he says, &lsquo;I didn&#39;t do that,&rsquo; &quot; Trump said. &quot;And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked again if he believed Putin, Trump called several top U.S. intelligence officials &quot;political hacks,&quot; and argued that other matters were more important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Now, you&rsquo;re not going to get into an argument. You&rsquo;re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there are any number of occasions when Trump has denied Russian meddling across the board. But at other moments, he has acknowledged that it is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same interview with NBC&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/pres-trump-s-extended-exclusive-interview-with-lester-holt-at-the-white-house-941854787582\">Holt</a> where he called the Russian thing &quot;a made-up story,&quot; Trump also suggested that Russia might try to shape U.S. elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it&rsquo;s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/transcript-of-president-elect-donald-j-trumps-news-conference.html\">January 2017</a> news conference, he said he thought Russia did hack into the DNC, but he blurred the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressed on his apparent acceptance of the intelligence agencies&rsquo; findings, Trump backpedaled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All right, but you know what, it could have been others also,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that he &quot;never said that Russia did not meddle in the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, he called the matter a &quot;made-up story,&quot; and a &quot;hoax.&quot; He has said that he believes Russian President Putin&rsquo;s denial of any Russian involvement. He told <em>Time</em>, &quot;I don&rsquo;t believe they (Russia) interfered.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when he has acknowledged the possibility that the Russians interfered, he has added that it could have been other countries or even individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s denial doesn&rsquo;t match what he has actually said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-19T13:21:46.088189", "ruling_date": "2018-02-19T14:12:24", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump falsely says he never denied Russian meddling", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-falsely-denies-he-denied-russian-medd", "ruling_link_text": "Except he did say that", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965202556204003328\">tweet</a>, Feb. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/12/2017-lie-year-russian-election-interference-made-s/\">2017 Lie of the Year: Russian election interference is a &#39;made-up story&#39;</a>, Dec. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/pres-trump-s-extended-exclusive-interview-with-lester-holt-at-the-white-house-941854787582\">Watch Lester Holt&#39;s Extended Interview With President Trump</a>, May 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/11/11/remarks-president-trump-press-gaggle-aboard-air-force-one-en-route-hanoi\">Remarks by President Trump in Press Gaggle Aboard Air Force One en route Hanoi, Vietnam</a>, Nov. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Time</em>, <a href=\"http://time.com/4591183/time-person-of-the-year-2016-donald-trump-interview/\">Donald Trump on Russia, Advice from Barack Obama and How He Will Lead</a>, Dec. 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/12/11/exclusive-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks-transition-process.html\">Fox News Sunday</a>, Dec. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AP, <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/politics/article/AP-FACT-CHECK-Trump-roars-on-Twitter-about-12623524.php\">Trump roars on Twitter about Russia probe</a>, Feb. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/02/18/fact-checking-trumps-error-filled-tweet-storm-about-the-russia-investigation/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_fact-checker-130pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.20a406af4177\">Fact-checking Trump&rsquo;s error-filled tweetstorm about the Russia investigation</a>, Feb. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/fact-check-trump-russian-meddling-election.html\">Trump Falsely Claims, &lsquo;I Never Said Russia Did Not Meddle&rsquo;</a>, Feb. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I never said Russia did not meddle in the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2018-02-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Donald Trump falsely denies that he denied Russian meddling"}
