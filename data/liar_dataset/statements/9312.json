Rick Santorum, R-Pa., criticized President Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 on CNN&rsquo;s <em>State of the Union</em>.<em> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santorum said he could support a smaller minimum wage increase, but not the nearly $3 an hour hike the president and other Democrats have called for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you look at the CBO report, half a million people would lose their jobs as a result of the Obama minimum wage increase,&quot; Santorum said. &quot;I&rsquo;m talking more in the range of a dollar, phasing that in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santorum didn&rsquo;t respond to our request for comment, but we were able to find the February 2014 <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44995-MinimumWage.pdf\"><u>Congressional Budget Office report</u></a> he was speaking about. Santorum is largely quoting the report correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama&rsquo;s proposed increase would take place in three steps, with the minimum hourly wage hitting $10.10 in 2016. It currently sits at $7.25, but many states choose to pay a higher minimum wage than federal policy mandates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That&rsquo;s about 0.3 percent of the workforce. CBO reached its conclusion, figuring:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Higher wages increase companies&rsquo; production costs. In turn, that lowers the amount of goods and services produced. That means companies need to employ fewer workers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing productive higher-wage workers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The one thing that Santorum didn&#39;t note is that the 500,000-job estimate is just that, an estimate. Job losses could range from hardly any, all the way up to 1 million. It pegged 500,000 jobs as its &quot;central estimate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say the CBO report had only bad news about Obama&rsquo;s proposal. The report also noted that about 16.5 million workers would see their wages go up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santorum said if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, &quot;half a million people would lose their jobs.&quot; Santorum said &quot;would&quot;&nbsp;but really the 500,000-job figure was&nbsp;the CBO&rsquo;s best guess. Analysts say job losses could be anywhere from<strong> </strong>just a<strong> </strong>few workers to as many as 1 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santorum&#39;s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-11T10:48:39.086185", "ruling_date": "2014-05-11T13:29:25", "ruling_headline": "Rick Santorum: Minimum wage increase would cost 500,000 jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-santorum-minimum-wage-increase-would-cost-500", "ruling_link_text": "CBO's best guess", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44995-MinimumWage.pdf\"><u>The effects of a minimum-wage increase on employment and family income</u></a>,&quot; February 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, &quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/20/kai-ryssdal/marketplace-host-kai-ryssdal-talks-cbo-report-mini/\"><u>&lsquo;Marketplace&rsquo; host Kai Ryssdal talks CBO report on minimum wage and lost jobs,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/02/18/cbo-obamas-minimum-wage-plan-would-cost-jobs-but-help-millions/\"><u>CBO: Obama&rsquo;s minimum wage plan would cost jobs but help millions</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 18, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "Pennsylvania", "id": 1077, "last_name": "Santorum", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "rick-santorum", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Santorum_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1077/", "total_count": 61, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The CBO says that if you raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, &quot;half a million people would lose their jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"", "statement_date": "2014-05-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
