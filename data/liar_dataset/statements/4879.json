And in a Nov. 29, 2011, op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., asserted that the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of passing Congress and going to the states during his first year in the Senate. He also said that he&rsquo;s not afraid to expose fellow Republicans who stand in its way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work,&quot; Santorum wrote. &quot;The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding &lsquo;no&rsquo; vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid that really happen? And was there really a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who dared to buck his party on this key issue?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum campaign aide Matt Benyon said his boss was referring to a vote in 1995, Santorum&rsquo;s first year in the Senate, and that the Republican in question was the late <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/index.ssf/2011/08/in_the_senate_hatfield_stood_a.html\">Mark Hatfield</a>, who died in August 2011 at 89.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum on Jan. 4, 1995, became a co-sponsor of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate. This was the era when Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich&rsquo;s Contract With America, had swept into power in the House and Senate, and the amendment, then as now, was a major part of their agenda.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt passed the House, with more than the two-thirds majority required, on a 300-132 vote on Jan. 26, 1995, but <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=104&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00098\">failed </a>&nbsp;to reach the two-thirds mark by one vote in the U.S. Senate on a 65-35 vote on March 2, 1995.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile several Democrats voted for the measure -- including then-U.S. Sens. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Paul Simon, D-Ill., and current Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa -- the lone Republican to oppose the measure was Hatfield.

Either we can have compromise, or we can have gridlock.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHatfield held onto his committee chairmanship, though he opted not to run for a sixth term in 1996.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum was correct in stating the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of clearing Congress and that the vote by the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations committee against it was key to its failure to pass. Hatfield said he opposed it because he viewed it as a &quot;gimmick.&quot; And Santorum and others did call for Hatfield&#39;s resignation as committee chairman. Santorum&#39;s description of his role as evidence of his leadership skills is an opinion, and we don&#39;t check opinions. But he has the basic history right.
