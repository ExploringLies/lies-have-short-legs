He says the nation needs a leader rather than a specialist in foreign affairs and often cites Ronald Reagan as an example of a strong leader without a foreign policy background.\n</p>\n<p>\n By contrast, McCain plays up his foreign policy credentials from his time in the Senate, especially his role as an outspoken supporter of additional troops in Iraq.\n</p>\n<p>\n It's clear that Romney didn't say exactly what McCain has attributed to him. It also is clear that while McCain doesn't quote him directly, he's taking Romney's words a bit too literally. The question then is how to judge the accuracy of what McCain has charged. Did Romney say a president doesn't need foreign policy experience?
