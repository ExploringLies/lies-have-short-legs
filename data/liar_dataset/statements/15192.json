The deficit in 1990 was $10.4 billion.

Americans racked up billions in purchases of everything from Chinese-made communications and computer equipment, to kitchen appliances and shoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on trade in goods, Trump&#39;s $500 billion figure is off by $125 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">U.S.-China trade in services</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When you factor in goods&nbsp;and services, which economists say paints the fuller picture, his claim is further off the mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States actually ran a surplus in the services trade with China in 2017 &mdash; to the tune of roughly $38.5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you factor that surplus into the two countries&rsquo; overall trade balance, the United States ran a roughly $336 billion deficit with China last year &mdash; which means Trump&rsquo;s figure was off by about $164 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible Trump may have confused the Chinese deficit with the United States&rsquo; overall trade deficit, which was $566 billion in 2017, according to the bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s also possible Trump used the $500 billion figure as a matter of habit.
