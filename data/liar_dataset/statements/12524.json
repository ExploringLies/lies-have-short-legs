Marco Rubio said in the wake of the Orlando shooting massacre that supporters of terrorism can freely say what they want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In America, radical speech is not a crime,&quot; Rubio told radio show host <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK2QEj83l-4&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hugh Hewitt</u></a>. &quot;And that&rsquo;s one of the challenges we face. You can stand all day long and call for all kinds of jihad. It&rsquo;s only when you actually moved toward plotting and acting on it that you become actionable and arrestable. These guys know that, and they use it against us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article83581522.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>had investigated the shooter </u></a>Omar Mateen in recent years after he claimed to co-workers that his family had connections to the al-Qaida terror network. But probes led to nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Rubio correct that radical speech in itself is not a crime?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Rubio&rsquo;s spokespersons and did not get a reply. We were curious what the laws said about radical speech and if he was speaking accurately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Radical speech</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple legal experts told us that Rubio&rsquo;s point is generally correct because speech is protected by the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/may/07/chris-cuomo/cnns-chris-cuomo-first-amendment-doesnt-cover-hate/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>First Amendment, </u></a>which states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:30pt\"><em>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courts have decided that certain speech is not protected by the First Amendment such as &quot;<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fighting_words\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fighting words</u></a>&quot; (speech that would likely draw someone into a fight.) But radical speech is not included in that list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The First Amendment protects radical speech,&quot; said University of Chicago Law professor Geoffrey Stone who has written about the <a href=\"http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-r-stone/isis-fear-and-the-freedom_b_8864050.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>dangers of compromising</u></a> First Amendment freedoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts said that Rubio omitted one key exception which stems from the 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case <em><a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/395/444\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Brandenburg vs. Ohio</u></a></em> involving a member of the Ku Klux Klan,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &nbsp;U.S. Supreme Court found that all speech is protected &quot;except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that means Americans have a right to advocate lawlessness -- such as overthrowing the federal government -- as long as they avoid inciting imminent illegal action as narrowly defined by <em>Brandenburg</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For example, if a mob has seized a person they think murdered a child and X starts shouting &lsquo;hang him, hang him,&rsquo; that would satisfy <em>Brandenburg</em>,&quot; Stone said. &quot;Radical speech doesn&#39;t come close.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So verbally supporting ISIS alone isn&rsquo;t a crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Supreme Court&rsquo;s thinking is that people have a First Amendment right to associate with even the worst and most degraded organizations,&quot; said Loyola law professor Alexander Tsesis. &quot;The government is prohibited from simply assuming ideological affinity will &lsquo;lead to imminent violence,&rsquo; or that it is truly threatening for that matter. Those assumptions must be backed by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there is a separate statute that says it is illegal to provide <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2339B\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>material support to a terrorist organization</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That could include &quot;instructing the foreign terror organization about how to gain standing in a community or religious center. That&rsquo;s an expressive act, but one the government has a compelling interest to prevent from achieving its supportive purpose,&quot; Tsesis said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many people may conclude certain radical speech is offensive, it is generally protected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are good reasons for that, said Lee Rowland, a senior attorney at the ACLU. Whether something is &quot;radical speech&quot; or &quot;hate speech&quot; is in the ears of the listener.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, some politicians and members of law enforcement have suggested that the Black Lives Matter movement engages in hate speech against police officers. Martin O&rsquo;Malley, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said that <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/247717-omalley-trump-promoting-hate-speech\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump</u></a> is promoting hate speech with his comments about immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fact that our Constitution robustly protects speech, including speech we find abhorrent, is a feature, not a bug,&quot; Rowland said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the age of terrorism and the internet, some have <a href=\"http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/files/2012/03/70.1.montgomery.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>raised the question</u></a> about whether <em>Brandenburg </em>can survive or whether we should find ways to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2015/12/isis_s_online_radicalization_efforts_present_an_unprecedented_danger.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>limit free speech</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said, &quot;In America, radical speech is not a crime.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radical speech is protected by the First Amendment and is not a crime. However, there are limited exceptions for when speech incites imminent crime or when communications specifically aid acts of terror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af1d6810-61b4-42c1-ad69-8ef452cf3af7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af1d6810-61b4-42c1-ad69-8ef452cf3af7</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-14T15:55:53.266479", "ruling_date": "2016-06-15T11:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio says after Orlando shooting that 'radical speech is not a crime'", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-says-after-orlando-shooting-radical-sp", "ruling_link_text": "First Amendment protects speech", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sen.
