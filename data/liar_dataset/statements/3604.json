Dennis Kucinich has been in the thick of the discussion since Congress teetered on the brink of refusing to renew some key provisions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith the help of Tea Party Republicans the Democratic minority in Congress did, indeed, preempt renewal when the vote went 277 to 148 for a nine-month extension of three key provisions. That was short of the two-thirds majority needed to keep the provisions alive through then end of the calendar year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey came back Feb. 17 and voted for an extension for 90 days to allow further debate. And it passed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot surprisingly, Kucinich had many things to say, invoking among other things, &quot;The Star Spangled Banner,&quot; the spirit of the First Amendment and bi-partisanship in defense of basic liberties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom the floor of the House and in a Feb. 10 press release, he said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What we have done with the PATRIOT Act, we&#39;ve given the government enormous powers. We&#39;ve given the government the right to reach deeply into people&#39;s private lives, into their business affairs, without a court order. We need to think about that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven that the debate will soon be revived as the 90-day extension nears expiration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe House was debating extensions of three provisions that already expanded the government&rsquo;s ability to keep an eye on us, and Kucinich rattled them off by the numbers, citing sections 206, 215 and 6001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse Republicans posted <a href=\"http://www.gop.gov/bill/112/1/hr514\">the three sections</a> online at the official GOP website. Their legislative digest didn&rsquo;t quote Kucinich, but didn&rsquo;t disagree with his reading of the provisions either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Business Records Provision (the So-Called &quot;Library Provision&quot;&mdash;Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act): This provision allows the FBI to apply to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court for an order granting access to tangible items&mdash;including books, records, papers, and other documents&mdash;in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Roving Wiretaps Provision (Section 206 of the PATRIOT Act): &nbsp;This provision authorizes FISA orders for multipoint or &quot;roving&quot; wiretaps for foreign intelligence investigations. &nbsp;A &quot;roving&quot; wiretap applies to an individual and allows the government to use a single wiretap order to cover any communications device that the suspect uses or may use.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Lone Wolf Provision (Section 6001 of Intelligence Reform Act): This provision amends the definition of &quot;agent of a foreign power&quot; to include individual foreign terrorists who may not be directly affiliated with a foreign power or international terrorist organization. &nbsp;This provision would prevent terrorists who work on their own from escaping surveillance simply because they are not agents of a foreign power or avowed members of an international terrorist group. &nbsp;This provision ONLY applies to foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo do the extensions of these three provisions allow the government to reach more deeply into people&rsquo;s lives?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYes, though the third one, the Lone Wolf provision, only applies to &quot;foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLanguage in Sections 215 and 206, two Kucinich specifically cited, enables federal investigators to gain access to things like library records, e-mails and financial papers and to wiretap multiple communications devices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut can it be done without a court order, as the congressman said? Kucinich and other critics of provisions in the PATRIOT Act decry that the law allows for warrant-less searches. Federal law enforcement officials do not have to go the regular route to obtain court authorization to conduct searches and collect evidence. In those cases the court&rsquo;s orders would ultimately become public.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe sections cited in the PATRIOT Act allow federal law enforcement to apply to a court for an order, but it&rsquo;s through a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which operates very differently than other U.S. courts. In the case of these special courts, the proceedings are conducted behind closed doors and kept secret.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKucinich is correct that the PATRIOT Act opens the door for government to conduct broad levels of surveillance into U.S. citizens&rsquo; lives and activities and that the surveillance can be without traditional law enforcement having to get the traditional warrant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the law does require an order from a court, albeit a special court that can do so secretly. That&rsquo;s an important detail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Kucinich&rsquo;s claim rates as Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-17T13:14:07.144272", "ruling_date": "2011-04-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
