A photo showed the alleged man inside a warehouse beside 12 black bins, some marked &quot;ballot box.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A month after the story first posted, readers asked if the story about massive fraud in a crucial swing-state could be true. Far from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a press release Sept. 30 knocking down the falsehood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a Christian myself, I take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging Christian ties,&quot; Husted wrote. &quot;No one from this so-called news outlet bothered to call the Franklin County Board of Elections or the Ohio Secretary of State&rsquo;s office to verify any facts. It was a deliberate attempt to deceive and mislead. We already get enough of that from the candidates. Enough already.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Ohio attempted to trace the origin of the photo that ran with the online story:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"birminghammaildotcodotuk original photo.jpg\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UgQdN4r5YqwjpRCw9_nyVBHSr3G6AM0qiOGooKU4XefgqUCefaKPgdi8L_Mv0Er26CQ_frGEALCSN-a0dpH6jz26igngiIGHq9pVqPvKBgIKPz-Cz-XgR0Y6ImBKW8oMU4DhEXrl\" style=\"height:416px; width:624px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The urban legend busters at <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/clinton-votes-found-in-warehouse/\">Snopes </a>beat us to it, linking to what appears to be the original photo from the<em> <a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/election-2015-polling-day-birmingham-9197585\">Birmingham Mail </a></em>in England, published in 2015. It looks like the Christian Times Newsletter flipped the original image and scrubbed off some of the &quot;Ballot Box&quot; labels on the bins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christian Times Newsletter identified the man in their photo as Columbus-area electrical worker Randall Prince, and said he discovered the ballots while &quot;doing a routine check&quot; of his company&rsquo;s wiring and electrical systems. (We left a message for a person with that name but did not hear back by deadline.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article alleged that the plan was to slip the fake ballots in with real ones when delivered to official election judges on Nov. 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franklin County Board of Elections told the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/10/ohio_secretary_of_state_jon_hu_9.html\">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a></em> that each ballot box, if real, would be secured with a double lock that must be opened with an official from each political party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article alleging vote mishandling has popped up on various <a href=\"http://www.usatodaypolitics.com/breaking-tens-of-thousands-of-fraudulent-clinton-votes-found-in-ohio-warehouse/\">other</a>&nbsp;websites.
