Eric Stewart on the November ballot, is already on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#39;s target list in emailed press releases &ndash; many of them similar to criticism aimed at other Republican lawmakers elsewhere in the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerhaps the most striking recent example is a missive earlier this summer that seeks to link DesJarlais&#39; campaign financing to Chinese prostitution money. Says the opening paragraph: &quot;Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Scott DesJarlais&#39;s (TN-04) Republican Majority.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlmost identical news releases &ndash; except for the names &ndash; were used by the DCCC against Republican U.S. Reps. Jim Renacci in Ohio and Sean Duffy in Wisconsin. Our Politifact colleagues in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/jul/12/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-claims-money-chinese-prostitution-supports-ji/\">Ohio </a>and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-says-p/\">Wisconsin </a>have sized up the DCCC claims and given them a &quot;Pants On Fire&quot; rating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Tennessee echo is in order.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DCCC contention rests on billionaire casino operator Sheldon Adelson, who has given a lot of money to Republican campaign funds that are supporting DesJarlais and other GOP congressmen. Adelson, meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit from a former employee that includes allegations that Adelson approved of prostitution at a casino in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that is now part of China.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DCCC release cites media reports on the lawsuit contentions and a comment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that Adelson is &quot;injecting millions of dollars in Chinese &#39;foreign money&#39; &quot; by contributing to Republican campaigns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What will Congressman Scott DesJarlais do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?&quot; said Jesse Ferguson of DCCC in the release. &quot;House Republicans like Congressman DesJarlais are fighting tirelessly to protect billionaires like Sheldon Adelson who make fortunes overseas and Adelson is now the largest single donor to Congressman DesJarlais&#39;s Republican Majority. It&#39;s past time for Congressman DesJarlais to reject the support of these groups funded by foreign money from a Chinese prostitution strategy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s what Politifact Ohio reported on the matter: &quot;The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn&rsquo;t spent anything so far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A spokesman for the Adelson&rsquo;s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always &lsquo;maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson&rsquo;s character.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, Adelson said there&rsquo;s not a &quot;shred of evidence&quot; to back his former employee&rsquo;s charges, and &quot;says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) <a href=\"http://www.adelsoncliniclasvegas.com/\">have given millions of dollars to set up clinics </a>around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the &hellip; claims even more preposterous.&quot; Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBasically, then, the charge by a disgruntled former employee is adamantly denied by Adelson.<br />\r\n\tDCCC has nonetheless seized upon the questionable claim, extrapolated and exaggerated it to taint all of Adelson&#39;s political donations with prostitution earnings. If stopped there, perhaps this could arguably fall into the realm of standard political hyperbole.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut to carry that on down a convoluted line to Scott DesJarlais and talk about &quot;his Chinese prostitution money?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYep, that sounds like Pants On Fire to us, too.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-01T10:26:52.349358", "ruling_date": "2012-08-01T10:23:57", "ruling_headline": "DCCC claims Chinese prostitution money funding DesJarlais campaign", "ruling_headline_slug": "desjarlais-taking-money-linked-chinese-prostitutio", "ruling_link_text": "Shaky at the source", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://blogs.knoxnews.com/humphrey/2012/07/dccc-scott-desjarlais-and-chin.html\">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee news release</a>, July 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-says-p/\">Politifact Wisconsin report</a>, July 16, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "", "id": 652, "last_name": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "democratic-congressional-campaign-committee", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mugs_mug-dnc_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/652/", "total_count": 38, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.dccc.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Scott DesJarlais&#39;s (TN-04) Republican Majority.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Campaign news release", "statement_date": "2012-07-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "4th Congressional District's congressman", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Tennessee", "id": 1664, "last_name": "DesJarlais", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "scott-desjarlais", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/DesJarlais_CongressMUG.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Tennessee", "edition": "Tennessee", "edition_slug": "tennessee", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 14, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Tennessee Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/14/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1664/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.scottdesjarlais.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
