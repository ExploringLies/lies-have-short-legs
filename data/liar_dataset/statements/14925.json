Co-host Dominic Salvia said the Huffington Post reported that conservative groups had already spent $3 million against Baldwin. He asked Laning how Baldwin and the state Democratic Party could counteract that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laning replied with an even more eye-catching money claim, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Well, I want you to know, first, that it&#39;s $5 million that&#39;s been spent against Tammy -- and it is five times more money spent against Tammy Baldwin, our senator, than all of the other U.S. Senate candidates up in 2018 combined. So, they are coming after Tammy Baldwin like no other.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means Laning is claiming $5 million has been spent against Baldwin -- five times more than has been spent, in total, against all of the other Senate Democrat incumbents who are up for re-election in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The stakes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It won&rsquo;t be known until after the August 2018 primary election which GOP opponent that Baldwin, who was elected in 2012, will face.

The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/upshot/senate-democrats-2018-midterms.html?_r=0\">says</a> it&rsquo;s a &quot;tossup&quot; as to whether Democrats can wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which has a <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/history/partydiv.htm\">two-seat edge</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noting the <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tammy-baldwin-wisconsin_us_5a4bd21ce4b0b0e5a7a91159?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004\">Huffington Post article</a> that was referenced in Laning&rsquo;s interview, the political news website Axios made <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/conservatives-have-already-spent-millions-against-tammy-baldwin-1515262303-3b226ce7-1842-4bac-8d0f-57a2e0736453.html\">this observation</a> about the Senate races and President <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>There are 10 Democratic senators [including Baldwin] up for re-election this year in states that Trump won.
