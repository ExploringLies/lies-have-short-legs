The group favors stricter immigration policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report has drawn criticism for some of its assumptions, such as a higher-than-usual estimate of immigrants in the country illegally (12.5 million, higher than the typically reported 11 million) and for excluding&nbsp;tax contributions made by U.S.-born children to parents here illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s difficult to determine a precise cost of illegal immigration due to lack of reliable data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Report did not focus on housing costs</div>\r\n\r\n<p>FAIR&rsquo;s report said illegal immigration costs about $135 billion a year, and that immigrants who are here illegally contribute about $19 billion in taxes annually. That puts net costs at about $116 billion a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blankenship said illegal immigration must be stopped because it costs $130 billion a year to house, feed and give benefits to people who shouldn&rsquo;t even be in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But FAIR&rsquo;s report did not include estimates for the cost of public housing benefits, citing a lack of reliable information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group also noted most welfare programs are not available to immigrants in the country illegally. But the group factored in costs for programs that benefit children born in the United States to parents here illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized FAIR for calculating welfare used by U.S.-born children, but failing to add in their potential tax contributions once they start working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Counting the benefits consumed but ignoring the tax revenue they pay (or will do so in the future) is one way FAIR gets such a negative result for this report,&quot; Nowrasteh wrote in a September 2017 <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/fairs-fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-study-fatally-flawed\">post</a> enumerating flaws in the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAIR estimated that the welfare of illegal immigration amounts to about $5.8 billion a year at the federal level and $2.9 billion a year at the state level (including school meals and child care programs).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Experts&#39; critique</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked more experts about the validity of FAIR&rsquo;s findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their estimate is reasonable, though the cost could be more or could be less, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though most immigrants living illegally in the United States come to work and pay billions in taxes, that does not make them a net fiscal benefit, Camarota said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other experts said there were flaws. For one, the report&rsquo;s bottom line included federal immigration enforcement costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It seems ridiculous to attribute the costs of border security to unauthorized immigrants.
