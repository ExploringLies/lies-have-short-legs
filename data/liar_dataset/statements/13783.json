Democrats say such policies suppress the vote. Republicans say they cut down on voter fraud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve spent a substantial portion of my life doing these cases at (the) Department of Justice,&quot; Perez said at the debate. &quot;Let me give you some facts and figures. We sued Texas, and we won. And we won, because over a 10-year period, 46 million votes were cast -- zero, count them, zero reported incidents of illegal noncitizen voting, two incidents of in-person voter fraud, (out of) 46 million votes cast. If we weren&#39;t on television I would call this a word that begins with a B. I will anyway. It&#39;s bunk. And you know what, it&#39;s bunk in every other case. And if you&#39;re in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID. If you&#39;re poor, that is a poll tax.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes a lot of different claims, but we will look at one aspect. Is it true that you have to drive 120 miles to get an acceptable ID in Texas?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer: The vast majority of Texans don&rsquo;t. Residents of its big metropolitan areas like Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin will certainly have a driver&#39;s license office much closer than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for a small percentage of the population, the trip could be that far, or even farther.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The source of the talking point</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistic comes from testimony against Texas&rsquo; voter ID law, which required voters to show certain forms of a government-issued ID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law, signed in 2011 by then-Gov. Rick Perry, required voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver&#39;s license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the law was under attack, Texas state Sen. Carlos Uresti, a Democrat from San Antonio, testified that some of his constituents would have to drive up to 120 miles to secure a driver&rsquo;s license, the <em>Houston Chronicle</em> <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Federal-judges-reject-Texas-Voter-ID-law-3827727.php\">reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This bit of testimony appears to have been picked up by federal appellate judges in Washington, who ultimately issued a unanimous ruling striking down the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During oral arguments, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins asked the attorney defending the law for the state whether the law would be a burden on people having to travel more than 100 miles for a driver&rsquo;s license. &quot;How does that impact your argument?&quot; Wilkins asked. &quot;Isn&rsquo;t that unduly burdensome?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Hughes, the attorney for Texas, said rural Texans are used to driving long distances, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/texas-tells-court-its-voter-id-law-does-not-discriminate/2012/07/13/gJQAvXopiW_story.html?utm_term=.ea225ebbe858\">according to</a> the <em>Washington Post</em>. &quot;People who want to vote already have an ID or can easily get it,&quot; he told the judges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But another judge on the panel, David S. Tatel, said, &quot;The record tells us there is a subset of registered voters who lack ID. We have to think about the economic burden and the fact that minorities are disproportionately poor.&quot; He, too, cited the 120-mile drive statistic, the <em>Post</em> reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the talking point made it into the <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Democracy/VRE/TX_voterID_083012.pdf\">ruling</a> in which the appeals court struck down the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the claim deserves some context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where would someone have to drive that far?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uresti, the Texas state senator, had testified that the drive could be up to 120 miles for some Texans who live between San Antonio and El Paso -- basically, the lightly populated western portion of the state. So that&rsquo;s where we focused our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found one newspaper reader who contributed some thoughts on the law to the <em><a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas/2014/10/30/sounding-off-best-southwest-readers-tell-us-what-they-think-of-the-texas-voter-id-law\">Dallas Morning News</a></em>. Kirby Warnock, of the Dallas suburb of Oak Cliff, told the paper that he has family in the Big Bend region, a rural area of west Texas along the Rio Grande.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If a person lives in tiny Imperial, or Terlingua, they have to get a friend or family member to drive them 60 miles and 120 miles respectively, round-trip, just to be able to vote,&quot; Warnock said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we looked at the situation in Terlingua. According to the <a href=\"http://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-7.pdf\">Texas driver&rsquo;s license handbook</a>, the closest driver&rsquo;s license office to Terlingua is in Alpine. According to Google Maps, that is 83.4 miles one way, or about 167 miles round trip. That&rsquo;s an even longer distance than Perez had said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This shows that there&rsquo;s at least one place in Texas that would require more than a 120-mile round-trip journey. (Imperial, Texas, for the record, is only 30 miles from Fort Stockton, or a 60-mile round trip, as Warnock indicated.) It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the 9,145 people who live in Brewster County, Texas -- where Terlingua is located -- are 43 percent Hispanic, which is a bit higher than the state average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering that there are no driver&rsquo;s license offices in 81 of the state&rsquo;s 254 counties, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that there are other locales beyond Terlingua for which a 120-mile round trip would be necessary to secure a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How common would such a long trip be?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just because a 120-mile drive is possible in Texas doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s common. Most of its 27.5 million people live in metropolitan areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a handle on how many people might be impacted by long trips for a driver&rsquo;s license, we looked at the 81 smallest-population <a href=\"https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/popcnty201011.html\">counties</a> in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, the population of Texas&rsquo;s 81 least-populated counties is 343,823, or 1.3 percent of the overall state population. And it&rsquo;s likely that many of them already have a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the 120-mile threshold is a pretty extreme scenario that affects a tiny slice of Texas&rsquo; population. That said, it&rsquo;s still possible that the law would be a burden for thousands of rural residents living far from a Department of Public Safety office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez said, &quot;If you&#39;re in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has some basis for this statement: The 120-mile figure did crop up in the court case against the law, and we found at least one example of a west Texas town for which the distance was actually even longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Perez not only failed to communicate just how rare this scenario is, but he didn&rsquo;t even use a basic qualifier like &quot;some people in Texas.&quot; Taken literally, he said everyone in Texas has to drive 120 miles to get a license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>CORRECTION, Feb, 27, 2017, 11 a.m.</strong>: After we published this article, several readers noted that there was a closer driver&rsquo;s license office to Terlingua than Fort Stockton -- the one in Alpine.
