The Sept. 16 event was hosted by the political arm of Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which endorsed Birdwell not long after his win, TLR spokeswoman Sherry Sylvester told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNothing odd about tapping the lobby for contributions after an election, right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor Birdwell, we wondered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Birdwell stumped toward victory, he was critical of his final foe, pointing out in a press release that he&#39;d raised more money from residents of the Waco-area district. He noted that his opponent, senator-turned-lobbyist David Sibley, had leaned on contributions from Austin-based special interests including lobbyists.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBirdwell&#39;s June 15 release says Sibley&#39;s candidacy &quot;has little to do with our district interests, but is all about him protecting his special interests. Waco, Cleburne, Waxahachie and the many small communities of this district deserve a voice to represent them. Austin already has over 1,400 lobbyists and we don&#39;t need one as our state senator.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement also says: &quot;The simple fact is, lobbyists and PACs can&#39;t vote, but my supporters who live in the district can.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time, Birdwell certainly wasn&#39;t attracting lobbyist support. Up to his win, Birdwell drew donations from a single Austin political action committee, according to his campaign finance reports. From March through June, less than $11,200, 7 percent of his total contributions, came from four Austin donors, counting two PACs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHas the rookie senator flip-flopped on taking donations from lobbyists?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBirdwell was unavailable for an interview. However, Maggie Mayfield, his campaign spokeswoman, shared a statement from the senator that refers to an unsuccessful Democratic Party lawsuit challenging Birdwell&#39;s legal residency in Texas which, Birdwell&#39;s statement says, resulted in &quot;significant legal bills.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBirdwell didn&#39;t volunteer the names of new lobbyist donors, but his statement says he&#39;s &quot;happy to to have the support of groups in Austin who didn&#39;t originally back my candidacy.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBirdwell&#39;s statement also says his campaign is having a number of fund-raisers across his district, though he has &quot;no expectation&quot; of recouping through donations the personal loans he made to his campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBirdwell&#39;s latest contribution and expenditure report doesn&#39;t show any outstanding loans. However, his campaign finance filings covering March through June indicate he put more than $170,000 in personal funds into his campaign -- about half of $337,000 in total campaign spending, we calculate. On the paperwork, Birdwell marked that he intends to get reimbursed from political contributions for the personal expenditures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll in all, it would require a break from political reality to ding the senator for accepting contributions from interest groups wielding clout at the Capitol. That happens routinely.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBesides, we see no sign Birdwell ever vowed not to take such aid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, after poking his opponent for piling up lobby money, Birdwell is evidently aboard with doing the same.
