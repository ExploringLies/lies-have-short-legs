Kristol argued that the United States has a responsibility to help out nations like Ukraine more than they have in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ten years ago there was the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, it was the first color revolution in spite of other efforts around the world. &hellip; All honor to the people of the Ukraine,&quot; Kristol said. &quot;That first revolution unfortunately slipped away. I think that&rsquo;s partly our fault, the west Europeans&rsquo; fault. We didn&rsquo;t do as much as we could have to help the newly democratic Ukraine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether or not the United States helped Ukraine enough a decade ago is a matter of opinion. But we can check Kristol&rsquo;s assertion about the Orange Revolution and its place in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kristol didn&rsquo;t return our request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is a color revolution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastern European uprisings have taken on many names. Czechoslovakia nonviolently overthrew its Communist government in 1989 in what was known as the Velvet Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the &quot;color revolutions&quot; speak to a more specific group of revolutions that came well after the original fall of Soviet Union, experts told us. They&#39;re associated with colors in a broad sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Color revolutions came to denote pro-western government coming to power in former Soviet republics,&quot; said Anton Fedyashin, a Soviet history professor at American University. &quot;None of them have succeeded in the long run.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts generally identify three color revolutions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Rose Revolution, Georgia, 2003</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Orange Revolution, Ukraine, 2004</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Tulip Revolution, Kyrgyzstan, 2005</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The first color revolution took place <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4532539.stm\"><u>in Georgia in November 2003</u></a>, when Georgian protesters overthrew the government of Eduard Shevardnadze and elected 35-year-old U.S. educated Mikheil Saakashvili. (The name, Rose Revolution, comes from the flower, but it is considered a &quot;color&quot; revolution.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60620/adrian-karatnycky/ukraines-orange-revolution\"><u>Orange Revolution came a year later</u></a> and ended when opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was elected president. (Yuschenko defeated Yanukovych, Ukraine&rsquo;s now-deposed leader.) The revolution was originally branded &quot;orange&quot; because that was Yuschenko&rsquo;s signature campaign color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Kristol was wrong when he said Ukraine&rsquo;s revolution was first. But Donnacha Beach&aacute;in, a Dublin City University government professor who published a book on the color revolutions, did say Ukraine&rsquo;s revolution attracted much more attention than Georgia&rsquo;s due to the nation&rsquo;s larger population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kristol said the Ukraine Orange Revolution &quot;was the first color revolution.&quot; It was the biggest color revolution, but experts say nobody considers it the first. Georgia&rsquo;s Rose Revolution took place a year earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate&nbsp;Kristol&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This item was updated at 6:51 p.m., Feb. 23, 2014, to note that the &quot;color&quot; revolutions speak more to a group of revolutions that have loose ties to colors -- than actual revolutions with colors in their names.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-23T11:52:05.634894", "ruling_date": "2014-02-23T18:16:16", "ruling_headline": "Bill Kristol says Ukraine's 2004 revolution was the first 'color revolution'", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-kristol-says-ukraines-2004-revolution-was-fir", "ruling_link_text": "Georgia came before Ukraine", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Donnacha Beach&aacute;in, Dublin City University government professor, Feb. 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Foreign Policy</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/18/why_the_color_revolutions_failed\"><u>Why the color revolutions have failed</u></a>,&quot; March 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GeoHive, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.geohive.com/earth/world.aspx\"><u>Overview of the world&rsquo;s nations and their population</u></a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/world/europe/ukraine.html?hpw&amp;rref=world&amp;_r=0\"><u>Archrival is freed as Ukraine leader flees</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/world/europe/ukraine.html?hpw&amp;rref=world\"><u>Ukraine Parliament moves swiftly to dismantle president&rsquo;s government</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Anton Fedyashin, American University history professor, Feb. 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Lincoln Mitchell, Columbia University&rsquo;s Harriman Institute associate, Feb. 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slate, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/01/garden_party_or_uprising.html\"><u>Garden party or uprising?</u></a>&quot; Jan. 20, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Editor, the Weekly Standard", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Bill ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 1093, "last_name": "Kristol", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "bill-kristol", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kristol_mug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1093/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.weeklystandard.com/author/william-kristol"}, "statement": "<p>The Ukraine Orange Revolution in 2004 &quot;was the first color revolution.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on ABC's \"This Week\"", "statement_date": "2014-02-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
