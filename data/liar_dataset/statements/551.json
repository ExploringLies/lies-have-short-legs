Barack Obama, tweaked the Democratic candidate for his unwillingness to censure President Bush.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"He won't even support his colleague Sen. Russ Feingold's motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps,\" Nader said in a June 18\n <a href=\" http://www.democracynow.org/2008/6/18/ralph_nader_on_barack_obama_it\" target=\"_blank\">\n  interview on the radio program Democracy Now!\n </a>\n \"He  &mdash; you know, he's letting the corporate-dominated city of Washington, the corporations who actually rule us now in Washington, determine his agenda. And that does not augur well.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Feingold of Wisconsin, known as one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, proposed a\n <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.RES.398:\" target=\"_blank\">\n  resolution to censure Bush\n </a>\n in March 2006, three months after the\n <em>\n  New York Times\n </em>\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bush+warrant+wiretap&amp;st=nyt\" target=\"_blank\">\n  reported\n </a>\n that the president had secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants.\n</p>\n<p>\n Censure, a congressional action that is not defined in the Constitution, has evolved as a formal expression of strong condemnation that is short of impeachment. The Senate has censured only one U.S. president &mdash; Andrew Jackson, in 1834, for firing the secretary of the treasury in a dispute over deposits in a national bank. Jackson's party, the Democrats, later expunged the censure.\n</p>\n<p>\n Feingold's proposal was to \"condemn [Bush's] unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans within the United States without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Republicans immediately attacked the measure, and many Democrats distanced themselves from it, including the senator and future presidential candidate from Illinois.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"It's not impeachment, but it's not something you apply lightly,\" Obama told the\n <em>\n  Chicago Tribune\n </em>\n at the time. \"And whether we want to start applying censure motions or impeachment when there are questions about a president's authority in national security is something that you have to be judicious about.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Only three senators &mdash; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and John Kerry, D-Mass. &mdash; have co-sponsored Feingold's resolution. It has not moved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Obama campaign did not respond to requests to clarify his position on this censure proposal. His past comments and his decision not to co-sponsor Feingold's resolution lead us to conclude Nader was correct in saying Obama does not support it. We find Nader's claim to be True.\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:11.874177", "ruling_date": "2008-06-30T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Obama hasn't backed censure for Bush", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-hasnt-backed-censure-for-bush", "ruling_link_text": "Obama hasn't backed censure for Bush", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n Democracy Now!\n <a href=\" http://www.democracynow.org/2008/6/18/ralph_nader_on_barack_obama_it\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Ralph Nader on Barack Obama: \"It is Quite Clear He is a Corporate Candidate from A to Z\"\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n The Library of Congress THOMAS,\n <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.RES.398:\" target=\"_blank\">\n  S.
