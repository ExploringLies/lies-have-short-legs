Bob Donovan has criticized the record of Mayor Tom Barrett on crime, the incumbent&rsquo;s support for a downtown streetcar and the conditions of the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 29, 2016, about two weeks ahead of the primary election, Donovan posted on his campaign Facebook page an attack that included a photograph of a dilapidated home. The home was pocked by broken or boarded-up windows, torn-off siding and holes in exterior walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is the true picture of &lsquo;Milwaukee&#39;s Renaissance&rsquo; after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett&#39;s leadership,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bobdonovanformayor/photos/a.696237853788688.1073741828.688642801214860/973982776014193/?type=3&amp;theater\">Donovan&rsquo;s post began</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post had been shared more than 80 times over the next three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it didn&rsquo;t take that long for a Facebook reader to question how true of a picture it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several hours after Donovan&rsquo;s posting, someone identified on Facebook as Gilberto Gonzales Jr. posted a reply, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This structure was used by the Milwaukee Fire Department for a training fire. It is scheduled for demolition. Prior to that fire it did not look like that. This photo by itself is deceiving.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gonzalez, it turns out, is someone who would know -- a lieutenant in the Milwaukee Fire Department who was the lead instructor of its training division until 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donovan responded on Facebook that evening, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Perhaps that&#39;s the case, Gilberto. But if you&#39;re familiar with the corner, you know too that there&#39;s about five additional boarded-up homes in eyesight, a fact that is not deceiving. By the way, I was not familiar with the history of the building, but quite frankly I have seen similar dilapidated residences in my travel throughout the city.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fire Department confirmed to us that the house, at 3068 N. 20th St., was used for training -- including with live fires in October 2015, which explains the large holes in the structure. The department chose it for training after it was put on the city&rsquo;s demolition list. Eventually it will be demolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donovan told us he didn&rsquo;t realize the house is in such a condition because of the training. But he contended that didn&rsquo;t detract from his overall point about deteriorating neighborhoods, saying &quot;I&rsquo;m certain we&rsquo;d have no problem locating another home that looks like that&quot; in Milwaukee&rsquo;s inner city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But whether other homes look something like that one doesn&rsquo;t bear on whether Donovan&rsquo;s Facebook statement is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the nearly six years of PolitiFact Wisconsin, we&rsquo;ve rated dozens&nbsp;of claims as Pants on Fire. That includes three made by Barrett during his gubernatorial campaigns against Gov. Scott Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of the POFs were related to actual flames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donovan said in a Facebook post: &quot;This is the true picture of &lsquo;Milwaukee&#39;s Renaissance&rsquo; after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett&#39;s leadership.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post included a picture of a dilapidated home, all right. But the condition is explained by the fact that the city Fire Department has set fires inside it and blasted holes in it for training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donovan&rsquo;s statement is false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-01T19:22:56.059084", "ruling_date": "2016-02-02T08:52:56", "ruling_headline": "Is this truly a picture of 'Milwaukee's Renaissance' under Mayor Tom Barrett?", "ruling_headline_slug": "truly-picture-milwaukees-renaissance-under-mayor-t", "ruling_link_text": "Er, the Fire Department sets fire to the house for training purposes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook, Bob Donvoan for Mayor <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bobdonovanformayor/\">posting and replies</a>, Jan. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Data on Demand, City of Milwaukee employee salaries 2014,&quot; May 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Ald.
