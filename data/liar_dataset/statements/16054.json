But the tables have turned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These days, Democrats across the country are citing the popularity of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, and blasting Republicans for their repeated efforts to chip away at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In North Carolina&rsquo;s 13th Congressional District, which includes Statesville, High Point and parts of Greensboro, a 30-second <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBQwX29rvmQ\">television ad</a> from Democratic congressional candidate Kathy Manning targets incumbent Republican Rep. Ted Budd for his vote on a &quot;repeal and replace&quot; bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad cites the case of a woman named Lilly who &quot;worked her way through UNC while living with a tumor that radiation and surgery could not cure.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But Lilly&rsquo;s congressman, Ted Budd, voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions like hers, letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment she needs,&quot; the ad says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budd is not the first Republican to see this attack. In the last several weeks, PolitiFact&rsquo;s state affiliates have awarded Half True ratings to nearly identical ads and statements from Democrats in <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/08/tammy-baldwin/does-leah-vukmir-support-letting-insurers-deny-cov/\">Wisconsin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/oct/18/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-attack-ron-desantis-about-pre-existi/\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2018/oct/11/abigail-spanberger/spanberger-ad-exaggerates-brats-vote-pre-existing-/\">Virginia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/oct/16/house-majority-pac/did-mimi-walters-get-over-200000-insurance-industr/\">California</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manning&rsquo;s ad has been <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;q=Kathy%20Manning%20Lilly\">active on Facebook</a> for more than a month, and the Manning campaign even set up a special <a href=\"https://www.tedbuddfacts.com/\">website</a> to showcase it. So we decided to give it a fresh look and see how it stacks up against the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The American Health Care Act and the MacArthur amendment</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Manning campaign declined to comment, but its <a href=\"https://www.tedbuddfacts.com/\">website</a> cited articles from <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4763609/pre-existing-conditions-ahca/\">Time</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/13/politics/house-obamacare-repeal-vote/\">CNN</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/aarp-letter-to-house-representatives-on-health-care-bill-fd.html\">AARP</a> to back up the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website noted that the vote in question was related to the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/text\">American Health Care Act of 2017</a>, a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. The AHCA, as the bill was called, passed the House with a <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll256.xml\">217-213</a> margin before ultimately failing in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare while eliminating the individual mandate and making other modifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budd voted yes on the AHCA, and while it did not allow states to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, it did open the door for insurers to hike premiums for those people under certain circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, an April 2017 <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170424/MacArthur%20Amendment.pdf\">amendment</a> from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., would have allowed states to apply for waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As PolitiFact noted in its <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/\">guide</a> to the MacArthur amendment, the amendment would have let states seek waivers from the AHCA&rsquo;s &quot;continuous coverage&quot; provision, which was supposed to require that Americans continuously carry health insurance or else face higher premiums for one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurers in states receiving waivers would have been permitted to consider a person&rsquo;s health status when setting premiums in the individual market for the year of penalty. In other words, they would have been able to raise the premiums, for one year, of a person with a pre-existing condition so long as that person had been uninsured for 63 consecutive days the previous year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently under Obamacare, premiums can only vary based on certain conditions, such as age, location or tobacco use. Any person without employer or government-provided health insurance is guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market &mdash; regardless of his or her health status &mdash; and cannot be charged a higher rate because of a pre-existing condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What would the AHCA have meant for pre-existing conditions?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Elizabeth Oglesby, Budd&rsquo;s campaign manager, said Manning&rsquo;s claim about protections for pre-existing conditions was inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not one person would be denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions, and (Manning) should apologize for her false, smear campaign and take down her ad,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the MacArthur amendment explicitly stated that &quot;nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s more nuance to unpack here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we mentioned before, the amendment would have allowed insurers to consider pre-existing conditions when writing policies for people who had lapses in their coverage the previous year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/press-release/analysis-6-3-million-people-with-pre-existing-conditions-would-be-at-risk-for-higher-premiums-under-the-houses-health-bill/\">estimated</a> that could mean that 6.3 million people could have faced higher premiums under the AHCA because of pre-existing health conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a significant number, but a small portion of the estimated 50 to 120 million people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. That means somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions could have experienced heightened premiums under the AHCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As PolitiFact has <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/\">noted</a> <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/\">before</a>, many low-income people have trouble staying covered without lapses, and the waiver system could have led insurers to drive premiums too high for these people during penalty years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ACHA would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to assist people who could not afford the penalty premiums. The waivers would have also allowed states to set up high-risk pools or participate in a federal invisible risk-sharing program to reimburse insurers for taking on high-risk individuals. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not clear how effective either measure would have been. In a <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/ama-urges-congress-oppose-amended-health-care-reform-bill\">press release</a>, the American Medical Association warned that the AHCA&rsquo;s waiver program &quot;could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why, when President <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/\">Donald Trump</a> and North Carolina Republican Rep. <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/\">Robert Pittenger</a> said the AHCA included coverage for pre-existing conditions, PolitiFact gave them both Mostly False ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Manning&rsquo;s ad said Ted Budd &quot;voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions &hellip; letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment (Lilly) needs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill included a line stating that insurers would not have been allowed to restrict access to healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in a limited way, the AHCA would have rolled back protections for pre-existing conditions by letting some insurers raise premiums based on a person&rsquo;s health status under certain circumstances. This could have led to somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions facing higher premiums. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Manning&rsquo;s ad is partially accurate, but leaves out important details and context. We rate this statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters&rsquo; Lab and PolitiFact.
