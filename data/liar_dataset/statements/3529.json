Jim Jordan chairs an influential group, the Republican Study Committee, at an opportune time. The group&rsquo;s political beliefs generally intersect with those of the Tea Party, and they include a desire to stop wasteful government spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the targets: redundant social welfare programs. You might know these as food stamps and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, but Jordan, of Urbana, Ohio, says there are a whole lot more than that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJordan counts 77 federal means-tested social welfare programs, citing that number during an interview on the FOX Business Network and in <a href=\"http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/Solutions/wra.htm\">backup materials to support one of his bills</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are seven -- this is according to Heritage Foundation, we get a list of these -- 77 different means tested social welfare programs -- 77 different ones,&quot; Jordan said during a March 22 appearance on Fox.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA week earlier he had introduced his <a href=\"http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/JORDAN_009_xml.pdf\">Welfare Reform Act of 2011</a>, which would require a full accounting of each social welfare program. It also would require food stamp recipients to work or prepare for a job, much as welfare reform under President Bill Clinton required of cash aid recipients. And it would require federal welfare spending to return to pre-recession levels, with allowance for inflation growth, once the unemployment rate fell to 6.5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe sheer number that Jordan cited -- &nbsp;77 separate welfare programs -- sounded extraordinary, so PolitiFact Ohio took a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJordan&rsquo;s office had a list with all 77 programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpace limits our ability to include all here, and Jordan&rsquo;s list is not online. You can find them in <a href=\"http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/JORDAN_009_xml.pdf\">Jordan&rsquo;s bill</a>, or watch as they scoll across the screen on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6g7tj7NLQU\">this Republican Study Committee video</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey include Medicaid, food stamps, &nbsp;Section 8 housing assistance; weatherization help for home owners and Pell grants to help students afford college. Jordan&rsquo;s list also includes low-income home energy assistance, school breakfast for children from low-income families, the Job Corps training program for at-risk teens and young adults, and Head Start for pre-kindergartners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost of the programs are geared toward people who fall below a certain income level. But Jordan&rsquo;s list also included at least a dozen programs that don&rsquo;t give federal money or services directly to the poor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome examples: the Appalachian Regional Commission; urban development block grants; Title 1 education grants that help schools in low-income areas; empowerment zones, which typically benefit businesses as well as communities, and Americorps, which sends college graduates into low-income neighborhoods for social service work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs this really welfare spending?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJordan&rsquo;s office says yes. His bill defines &quot;means-tested welfare spending&quot; as &quot;any federal program that is designed to specifically provide assistance or benefits exclusively to low-income Americans.&quot; Each of the 77 programs he cites were designed with that in mind.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis bill also states that &quot;community and economic development programs targeted to low-income communities or populations shall be considered means-tested welfare programs&quot; for purposes of the legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked <a href=\"http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/socwork/faculty/Abramowitz.pdf\">Mimi Abromovitz</a>, an authority on welfare reform at City University of New York&rsquo;s Hunter College of Social Work. In an e-mail, she said, &quot;To me, &lsquo;means test&rsquo; means you have to be below a specified income level and the level varies by program.&quot; She also referred us to <a href=\"http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/79/Federally-Administered-Means-Tested-Programs.html\">a description on LibraryIndex.com</a>, a reference site on social topics. It said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Means-tested programs provide benefits to those whose income and financial resources meet certain requirements. More than 80 benefit programs provide cash and/or non-cash aid to individuals who meet certain low-income qualifications in the United States.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn case you missed that: &quot;More than 80.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Abromovitz noted a<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05221.pdf\"> 2005 Government Accountability Office study</a> that found that 50 percent to 70 percent of eligible people do not use these programs. But the question here is the number of programs, not their outreach -- and the GAO addressed that, too:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Each year through more than 80 means-tested programs, the federal government provides benefits and services to individuals and families with low incomes &mdash; just 12 of which account for as much as $330 billion in annual federal expenditures.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GAO said 80. Jordan said 77.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou could say he was just being conservative, but on the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates as True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/04/rep_jim_jordan_says_federal_go.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-04T18:37:51.470352", "ruling_date": "2011-04-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
