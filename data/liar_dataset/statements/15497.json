Scott Walker in the 2018 &nbsp;election. McCabe, a political activist, is running on a platform of &quot;principle over party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we were waiting for the latest cat video to buffer, we decided to check out his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A look at the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for backup, McCabe pointed to a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/2016/08/08/wisconsin-broadband-speeds-lagging/88416370/\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> article which cited a study that ranked Wisconsin as 49th for fixed broadband internet speed. Fixed broadband &nbsp;encompasses landlines, desktops and laptops -- basically everything except mobile connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, McCabe made a broad statement about internet speed, but cited data that looks at only part of the picture -- and ignores a major chunk of internet use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, the 2016 <a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/reports/united-states/2016/\">Speedtest </a>ranking McCabe cited did rank Wisconsin 49th, with a speed of 28.59 megabits per second, when it comes to just broadband speed. But if you look just at mobile, Wisconsin ranked much higher, at 15th place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study did not include an average of broadband and mobile, but more recent data from <a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q1-2017-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-report.pdf\">Akamai&rsquo;s 2017 State of the Internet Report</a>, issued in the first quarter of 2017, did combine data from both. That ranking placed Wisconsin 30th for average overall internet speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications professor emeritus Barry Orton about McCabe&rsquo;s claim. He said all data on the subject is a bit fuzzy, but said Wisconsin traditionally does not do as well as other states in terms of average speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Traditionally, WI has been ranked very low compared to other states, primarily because there are so many rural areas in Wisconsin with almost no internet service,&quot; Orton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg said Walker has done extensive work to boost and strengthen Wisconsin&rsquo;s broadband system, including creating a <a href=\"https://walker.wi.gov/press-releases/governor-walker-announces-768-million-preliminary-broadband-expansion-grants-connect\">$7.68 million dollar grant</a>, the largest in state history, to support broadband expansion. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Altenburg this grant will provide 1,600 business locations and 18,000 residential locations with high-speed internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we told McCabe what we found, he promised to adjust his claim in the future. He said his main point was that <a href=\"https://www.governorbluejeans.com/high_speed_internet_everywhere_in_wisconsin_in_5_years_under_mccabe_plan\">Wisconsin&rsquo;s goal</a> should be to have high-speed internet access everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCabe claimed that Wisconsin ranks 49th in internet speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2016 ranking put Wisconsin at 49th-slowest for broadband internet speed -- that is, for land-based internet, but that only provides a partial picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When mobile is factored in, the state ranks much higher, in the neighborhood of 30th place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate McCabe&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-13T18:13:14.378297", "ruling_date": "2018-06-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mike McCabe says state's internet speed is almost dead last ", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-gubernatorial-candidate-mike-mccabe-says", "ruling_link_text": "Slow, but not that slow", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://newstalk1510am.com/podcast/4-18-18-mike-mccabe-d-wi-gubernatorial-candidate/\">Newstalk 1510am,</a> Mike McCabe (D), WI Gubernatorial Candidate, April 18, 2018, claim at 2:40 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/2016/08/08/wisconsin-broadband-speeds-lagging/88416370/\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>, &quot;Wisconsin broadband speeds lagging,&quot; August 9, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.speedtest.net/reports/united-states/2016/\">Speedtest</a>, &quot;Market Report,&quot;August 3, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q1-2017-state-of-the-internet-connectivity-report.pdf\">Akamai&rsquo;s State of the Internet</a>, &quot;Connectivity Report,&quot;&nbsp;Q1 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone, Barry Orton, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor emeritus telecommunications, professional development and applied studies, June 6, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Austin Altenburg, Press Secretary for Governor Scott Walker, June 7, 2018. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://walker.wi.gov/press-releases/governor-walker-announces-768-million-preliminary-broadband-expansion-grants-connect\">Scott Walker Office of the Governor</a>, &quot;Governor Walker announces $7.68 million in preliminary broadband expansion grants to connect 46 rural communities&quot;, April 12, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.governorbluejeans.com/high_speed_internet_everywhere_in_wisconsin_in_5_years_under_mccabe_plan\">McCabe Principle Over Party</a>, &quot;High-speed internet everywhere in Wisconsin in 5 Years Under McCabe plan,&quot; April 17, 2018.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Mike ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 1473, "last_name": "McCabe", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "mike-mccabe", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Mike_McCabe.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1473/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Wisconsin is &quot;49th in the country in internet speed.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a podcast", "statement_date": "2018-04-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 115, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/115/", "subject": "Technology", "subject_slug": "technology", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Democratic candidate for governor Mike McCabe claims Wisconsin ranks 49th in internet speed."}
