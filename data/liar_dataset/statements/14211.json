Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website&rsquo;s efforts to cut down on fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post says U.S. Sen. Hal Lindsay, D-N.J., owned a Wyoming ranch that was just raided by the agency, which seized &quot;more than 400 marijuana plants, 2 greenhouses full of opium-producing poppies and a small lab that was pumping out massive amounts of refined, finished product.&quot; The story said Lindsay was released on $10 million bail and faced more than 70 years in prison just for the opium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except Lindsay isn&rsquo;t in any trouble, because he doesn&rsquo;t exist. New Jersey&rsquo;s two senators are Democrats <a href=\"https://www.booker.senate.gov/\">Cory Booker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.menendez.senate.gov/\">Bob Menendez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There also was no bust, because the story was <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/the-dea-just-raided-a-united-states-senator-dems-in-a-panic/\">made up and posted on June 10</a> at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair, a fake news operator <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/may/31/If-youre-fooled-by-fake-news-this-man-probably-wro/\">whom we have profiled in the past</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs fake news stories written by Blair in an attempt to fool conservative readers. These stories often are posted on other websites without attribution or indication they are fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/about-us/\">site&rsquo;s disclaimer said</a> that it &quot;is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that&rsquo;s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don&rsquo;t actually exist.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story about the drug bust continued on Blair&rsquo;s website, with the fictional Lindsay agreeing in a followup story <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/democrat-senator-raided-by-dea-gives-up-his-business-partner-for-immunity/\">also posted on June 10</a> to flip on his business partner, Lester Malroney. The saga telegraphed it&rsquo;s contrived premise, calling Malroney &quot;an obviously fictitious name&quot; and suddenly referred to Lindsay as a senator from Wyoming, not just having a ranch in Wyoming (the state&rsquo;s senators are actually Republicans <a href=\"https://www.enzi.senate.gov/public/\">Mike Enzi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.barrasso.senate.gov/public/\">John Barrasso</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fictitious saga led to the <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/senator-lindsay-killed-in-protective-custody/\">pretend senator&#39;s death</a> and more, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/furious-chelsea-clinton-thrown-to-the-floor-and-hancuffed-after-senator-lindsay-scandal-linked-to-clinton-foundation/\">implicating Chelsea Clinton</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;tying the DEA raid to a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/may/12/blog-posting/fake-news-clinton-foundation-has-no-ships-didnt-sm/\">previous fake yarn</a> about the Clinton Foundation smuggling contraband and refugees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to reach NewsFeedHunter.com through their website contact form to ask if they knew the story was fake, but didn&rsquo;t receive a reply.
