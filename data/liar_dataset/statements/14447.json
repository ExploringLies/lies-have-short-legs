Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to curb fake news on the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post, which <a href=\"http://www.ustruthwire.com/2017/08/13/internet-sleuths-just-found-the-smoking-gun-on-dems-planning-violence-in-charlottesville/\">we also saw</a> <a href=\"https://the-global-news.com/bombshell-internet-sleuths-just-found-smoking-gun-dems-planning-violence-charlottesville/\">on other websites</a>, said that violent clashes Aug. 12 between white nationalists and people demonstrating against their Unite the Right rally were possibly the result of a coordinated protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The media flurry after the confusing happenings in Charlottesville yesterday is fueling violence in this country and it appears that this is exactly what the Dems want,&quot; the post read. &quot;Users on Reddit found a potential smoking gun Craigslist post seeking to hire protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina for &lsquo;rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post included an image of a Craigslist ad for a company called Crowds On Demand, &quot;a Los Angeles-based Public Relations firm specializing in innovative events.&quot; The ad, which said it had been posted a week prior, was &quot;looking for enthusiastic actors and photographers in the Charlotte, NC area to participate in our events.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that said Charlotte, N.C., and not Charlottesville, Va. Both cities were named for King George III&rsquo;s wife, <a href=\"http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/hanover_14.html\">Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a>, but that&rsquo;s about all the two places share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online detectives focused on a portion of the ad that read, &quot;Our events include everything from rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said the pay was typically $25 per hour, plus travel expenses to an event. The Craigslist ad asked interested people to reply to the ad, which has been repeatedly <a href=\"https://charlotte.craigslist.org/tlg/d/actors-and-photographers/6253308843.html\">flagged for removal</a> and then restored by Craigslist. During the research for this fact-check, it had been flagged and restored twice, but is unavailable as of this writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is highly suspicious and almost suggests that these people were being hired for the rally in Charlottesville this weekend to impersonate &lsquo;white nationalists&rsquo; and incite violence so it would look like they were at fault for the chaos,&quot; the NewsUpToday.com post read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s hardly a &quot;smoking gun&quot; implicating Democrats in faking protests and causing violence. The Craiglist ad proves nothing at all, beyond the fact that Crowds On Demand is a real company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowds On Demand <a href=\"https://crowdsondemand.com/\">hires crowds for events</a>, including <a href=\"https://crowdsondemand.com/political-services/\">political rallies</a>. It&rsquo;s run by a UCLA political science graduate named Adam Swart, who <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/crowd-hiring-politics-campaign-2016/399002/\">started the company in 2012</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swart has said that his company has been hired by political campaigns before, and that Crowds On Demand will work with any political party. Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y.,&nbsp;for example, had paid Crowds On Demand $15 a head for people to attend events during his 2013 New York City mayoral run, the <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2013/08/28/weiner-paid-for-phony-supporters-at-campaign-events-source-says/\"><em>New York Post</em> reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/donald-trump-escapes-fec-punishment-paid-actors-at-presidential-announcement-966428\">also used crowd-hiring services</a>, although they denied it at first. Trump used a different crowd-filling company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swart did not return multiple phone calls and emails from PolitiFact asking for comment. He did <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/crowds-on-demand/\">provide a statement to Snopes.com</a> saying Crowds On Demand didn&rsquo;t work with either the Unite the Right rally or the counter-protesters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We were not involved in any capacity with the recent tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those impacted by the violence,&quot; the statement read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some liberal event organizers we contacted denied using any service to hire protesters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walter Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Curry School of Education, had obtained permits for liberal counter-demonstrations in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. (Trump had <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-charlottesville-counter-protest/\">falsely claimed protesters on the left hadn&rsquo;t gotten permits</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As far as I know, and I am very connected to various protest groups involved, there was no use of this kind of company,&quot; Heinecke told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Huffman, who heads the anti-Trump group Indivisible Charlotte in North Carolina, said he had quickly coordinated a <a href=\"http://www.fox46charlotte.com/news/local-news/273655225-story\">candlelight vigil in Charlotte</a> the evening after the attack in Charlottesville. He said close to 400 people attended after he posted a Facebook event inviting people to gather the evening of Aug. 13. Crowds On Demand was in no way affiliated with that vigil, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At no time has Indivisible Charlotte hired any actors to attend any of our rallies,&quot; Huffman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers said there is proof Democrats hired actors to plan violence in Charlottesville.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several websites implied that left-leaning protesters hired crowds to impersonate white supremacists to incite violence. They pointed to a Craigslist ad &nbsp;for California-based Crowds On Demand hiring paid actors in Charlotte, N.C., to join crowds at unspecified events as evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But wild suspicions and allegations aren&rsquo;t enough to serve as proof. Crowds On Demand denied being involved, and we found no confirmation of the accusations the bloggers made. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It requires a big leap in logic to presume an ad in North Carolina has anything to do with protesters clashing in Virginia. We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-18T12:08:03.968337", "ruling_date": "2017-08-18T13:50:50", "ruling_headline": "Blog posts wrongly say there's proof Democrats hired actors to play white nationalists", "ruling_headline_slug": "blog-posts-wrongly-say-theres-proof-democrats-hire", "ruling_link_text": "Craigslist ad for different city proves nothing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NewsUpToday.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://newsuptoday.com/bombshell-internet-sleuths-just-found-smoking-gun-dems-planning-violence-charlottesville/\">BOMBSHELL: Internet Sleuths Just Found the SMOKING GUN on Dems Planning Violence in Charlottesville</a>,&quot; Aug. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://nypost.com/2013/08/28/weiner-paid-for-phony-supporters-at-campaign-events-source-says/\">Weiner paid for phony supporters at campaign events, source says</a>,&quot; Aug. 28, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Atlantic</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/crowd-hiring-politics-campaign-2016/399002/\">1-800-HIRE-A-CROWD</a>,&quot; July 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/donald-trump-escapes-fec-punishment-paid-actors-at-presidential-announcement-966428\">Donald Trump Escapes FEC Punishment Over Paid Actors at Presidential Announcement</a>,&quot; Jan. 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox 46, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.fox46charlotte.com/news/local-news/273655225-story\">Charlotte holds vigil for the violence coming out of Charlottesville</a>,&quot; Aug. 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/crowds-on-demand/\">Was a Crowd Hire Company Involved in Protests Against a White Supremacist Rally?</a>,&quot; Aug. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-charlottesville-counter-protest/\">Donald Trump wrong that Charlottesville counter-protesters didn&#39;t have a permit</a>,&quot; Aug. 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craigslist.com, <a href=\"https://charlotte.craigslist.org/tfr/d/actors-and-photographers/6253305119.html\">Crowds On Demand ad in Charlotte, N.C.</a>, accessed Aug. 15-17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Scott Huffman, Indivisible Charlotte organizer, Aug. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Walter Heinecke, University of Virginia educational research professor, Aug. 16, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says there is proof Democrats hired actors to plan violence in Charlottesville.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Internet posts", "statement_date": "2017-08-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
