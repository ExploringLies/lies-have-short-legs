Yet&nbsp;McSally &mdash; who chairs a House subcommittee responsible for oversight of border security programs&nbsp;&mdash; ultimately voted to appropriate the funds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, McSally has been neither a fierce critic nor a staunch&nbsp;supporter of the border wall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Ward campaign spotlights McSally&rsquo;s questions on border wall funding</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward&rsquo;s team turned the spotlight on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepMcSally/status/974390109033426945\">March 15 tweet</a> from McSally that said, &quot;I have always supported building a wall,&quot; linking to a Fox News interview in which she decried California&rsquo;s immigration policies as too lenient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But McSally&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t always such a fan, Ward&#39;s campaign said,&nbsp;pointing&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/317011-border-district-republicans-skeptical-about-trumps-wall\">comments</a>&nbsp;about her and that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/border-lawmakers-balk-at-donald-trumps-wall-request-1492802294\">she</a> <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/us/article/Down-payment-on-border-wall-in-doubt-in-Congress-11075986.php\">made in</a> <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/343656-gop-lawmakers-push-back-against-funding-for-border-wall\">2017</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/317011-border-district-republicans-skeptical-about-trumps-wall\">The Hill</a></em>&nbsp;in January 2017 reported that Hurd, from Texas, &quot;actively opposes the wall,&quot; while McSally and Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., &quot;expressed skepticism&quot; about its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/martha-mcsally-town-hall/index.html\">CNN reported</a> on a rowdy town hall in her district the next month and said McSally &quot;made it clear she wasn&#39;t sold on Trump&#39;s plan to build a border wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not a continuous, 2,000-mile border wall, no,&quot; CNN quoted McSally as saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/border-lawmakers-balk-at-donald-trumps-wall-request-1492802294\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> in April 2017 reported that McSally said walls do&nbsp;little to stop criminal organizations from getting across the border. It cited the McSally-Hurd oversight <a href=\"https://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-mcsally-and-hurd-call-dhs-substantiate-funding-request-border-wall\">letter</a> with questions about the request for taxpayer money. (McSally and Hurd are chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the House Committee on Homeland Security&rsquo;s Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While we have both publicly stated in the past that we believe physical barriers to be one of many tools required to gain operational control of the border, we also believe that an expenditure this large, and submitted with limited details, deserves additional scrutiny to ensure funds are being used effectively in pursuit of our shared goal of securing the southwest border,&quot; their letter said. It listed several questions, including whether the department would consider existing manmade and natural barriers when constructing new barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Trump issued an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-border-security-immigration-enforcement-improvements/\">executive order</a> in January 2017 calling for the&nbsp;border wall and the hiring of an&nbsp;additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents, McSally&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/us-rep-mcsally-statement-border-executive-order\">said</a>&nbsp;it was a&nbsp;&quot;strong start in the right direction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When it comes to barriers, they are important where appropriate, but only part of the equation. What we need is a comprehensive strategy to grow situational awareness, build operational control, and dismantle the cartels and their networks,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2017, McSally voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll435.xml\">in favor</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3219\">of a spending bill</a> that included money for border fencing and wall construction planning. But as AZCentral.com <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2017/07/28/border-wall-funds-approved-house-az-delegation-split/517861001/\">noted</a>, McSally <a href=\"https://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/us-rep-mcsally-applauds-house-passage-security-appropriations-package\">praised</a> the bill for what it did for defense, veterans and water, but stopped short of mentioning the border wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair told PolitiFact that McSally is &quot;unequivocally in favor of building a wall,&quot; with the addition of technology and agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally has also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4760/text#toc-HEAF13FB7FDF84BC0B83E7B4E3EC824AA\">sponsored and</a> <a href=\"https://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/mcsally-homeland-security-chairman-introduce-bill-improve-border\">supported</a> <a href=\"https://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/mcsally-votes-fund-dhs-border-security-assets\">several bills</a> <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/local/billion-a-year-border-bill-unneeded-critics-say/article_86d0a126-2d81-5728-9b8d-7626f34776a2.html\">to increase </a><a href=\"https://mcsally.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/strong-start-house-passes-three-us-rep-mcsally-bills-improve-security\">border security</a> since joining&nbsp;Congress in 2015, her campaign said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/5642642993001/?#sp=show-clips\">November 2017 Fox News interview</a>, McSally said a necessary border strategy is one that &quot;absolutely includes the border wall and physical infrastructure where appropriate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally&#39;s remarks and actions&nbsp;in 2017 show that while she hasn&#39;t been an effusive supporter of the wall, she favors it&nbsp;to an extent. It&#39;s worth mentioning that&nbsp;McSally <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/18/more-arizona-voters-didnt-equal-more-votes-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/93805952/\">represents a district that voted for Hillary Clinton</a> in the 2016 presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Flip-flop or not?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that mean McSally has flip-flopped on border wall funding?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Josiah M. Heyman, an anthropology professor and director of the Center for Interamerican and Border Studies at the University of Texas at El Paso, said he understood Ward&rsquo;s point given McSally&rsquo;s 2017 reticence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted that an appropriations bill she voted for&nbsp;was for &quot;a very limited version of the wall,&quot; and much of it restricted to reworking segments that already exist. The funds also can&rsquo;t be used to build any of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/\">new wall prototypes</a>, Heyman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said &quot;it is disingenuous to claim that someone who has acted cautiously or recommended scrutiny of border wall plans is either for or against building the wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;McSally has voted in favor of funding border fencing and wall construction,&quot; Cohen said. &quot;Cautious support may in fact ultimately be quite important to the realization of effective border security given that there are many types of border fences and walls that are ineffective or dangerous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward in a Facebook post called McSally a #FlipFlopBorderHawk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, McSally publicly questioned a&nbsp;funding request for border barriers &mdash; due to limited details &mdash; but ultimately voted in favor of it. McSally has said a border wall alone will not stop illegal immigration or criminal organizations, but&nbsp;can work in certain areas. In 2018, McSally has offered a strong embrace, saying she has &quot;always supported building a wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
