There is no maximum limit on super PAC donations, and donors are public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Soros could give a million to New Day for America,&quot; said Sutton, referencing the super PAC supporting Kasich. &quot;He doesn&rsquo;t have to hide it, why would he do that? If he&rsquo;s artificially manipulating Kasich&rsquo;s campaign in the name of other people, just look at the list of donors and explain all these other companies that have given more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/contrib_all.php?cmte=C00581868&amp;type=A&amp;cycle=2016\">the list</a> of donors ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are donations to the New Day for America PAC from two individuals linked to Soros. <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/?q=Bessent&amp;cx=010677907462955562473%3Anlldkv0jvam&amp;cof=FORID%3A11\">Scott Bessent</a> is a former chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management who left to start his own hedge fund company last year, with $2 billion in seed money from Soros. Campaign finance records show that he donated $200,000 to New Day for America, as well as $2,700 to Kasich directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bessent has&nbsp;donated to other conservative causes since 2015, including the Right to Rise PAC that supported Jeb Bush ($5,000) and to the Republican National Committee ($39,800). But he&#39;s donated to Democrats too; in 2013 <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/john-kasich-george-soros-fund-managers-donations\">he gave $25,000 </a>to the Ready for Hillary PAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/index.php?q=Druckenmiller&amp;cx=010677907462955562473%3Anlldkv0jvam&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;siteurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensecrets.org%2F\">Stanley Druckenmiller</a>, who managed assets for Soros from 1988 to 2000, gave $450,000 to New Day for America last year. If Druckenmiller shares any of Soros&rsquo; political philosophies, they aren&rsquo;t apparent in his donor history. He has also consistently given money to Republican candidates&rsquo; super PACs and the Republican National Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Trusted Leadership PAC spokeswoman confirmed that Bessent and Druckenmiller are the donors that&nbsp;connect Soros to Kasich.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks campaign contributions, Soros has given $7 million this cycle to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00495861&amp;cycle=2016\">Priorities USA Action</a>, a super PAC that supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He also gave $25,000 to the pro-Clinton <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/detail.php?cmte=C00540997\">Ready PAC,</a> and $1 million to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00492140\">American Bridge 21st Century,</a> which funds opposition research against Republican candidates and causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a &quot;firewall&quot; between candidates and the super PACs backing them, said Sutton, and while Kasich may not be happy about contributions from people connected to Soros, he can&rsquo;t tell them to knock it off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates cannot have any contact with PACs or their donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For these reasons, Sutton said, &quot;If there was a conspiracy, it&rsquo;s the worst conspiracy ever, because it&rsquo;s not working.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added: &quot;Kasich&rsquo;s people would love to have power at this level, because then they might be able to raise enough money to rival anything near what&rsquo;s going on in other campaigns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00581868\">campaign finance filing</a> from the pro-Kasich PAC shows nearly $10 million in contributions from individual donors, and $14 million in expenditures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connie Wehrkamp, spokeswoman for New Day For America, told PolitiFact Ohio that the organization sent station managers in Wisconsin a letter on March 29, reading, &quot;We demand that your station investigate the false, misleading, and deceptive claims contained in this advertisement and remove it from the air.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, three television statements in Green Bay and one station in Wausau have pulled the ad, Wehrkamp said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pro-Cruz ad says, &quot;Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling his (Kasich&rsquo;s) super PAC.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donations totalling $650,000 from two guys who once worked with Soros hardly equate to &quot;bankrolling&quot; Kasich. The ad&rsquo;s on-screen text goes even further to mislead voters with a blatantly false claim that Soros is directly giving to Kasich. Campaign finance records prove otherwise, with Soros donating handsomely to pro-Clinton groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rule the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-04T16:11:29.405742", "ruling_date": "2016-04-04T16:09:01", "ruling_headline": "No, George Soros is not bankrolling John Kasich's campaign", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-george-soros-not-bankrolling-john-kasichs-campa", "ruling_link_text": "Soros' friends not friends of Dems this cycle", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Campaign finance reporting, OpenSecrets.org, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/donor_detail.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=U0000000364&amp;type=I&amp;super=N&amp;name=Soros%2C+George\">March 21, 2016 </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog entry, &quot;George Soros gives John Kasich $700,000 to stay in race,&quot; DCClothesline.com, <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2016/03/27/george-soros-gives-john-kasich-700000-to-stay-in-race/\">Mar. 28, 2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, &quot;Stanley Druckenmiller, a billionaire financier, backs John Kasich,&quot; New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/21/stanley-druckenmiller-a-billionaire-financier-backs-john-kasich/?_r=0\">Feb. 21, 2016 </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Tom Sutton, political science professor, Baldwin Wallace University, March 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Connie Wehrkamp, New Day for America spokeswoman, March 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Kristina Hernandez, Trusted Leadership PAC, April 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3455, "last_name": "Trusted Leadership PAC", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "trusted-leadership-pac", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3455/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://trustedleadershippac.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling (John Kasich&rsquo;s) super PAC.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Trusted Leadership PAC ad ", "statement_date": "2016-03-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "Governor of Ohio as of Jan. 10, 2011", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 533, "last_name": "Kasich", "mostly_true_count": 18, "name_slug": "john-kasich", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/John_Kasich_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/533/", "total_count": 67, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://ohio.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
