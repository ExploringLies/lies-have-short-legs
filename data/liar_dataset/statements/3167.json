The Truth-O-Meter must address a matter of Southern pride.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe honor and reputation of our local groundhog General Beauregard Lee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor three decades, the South&rsquo;s most esteemed weather prognosticator has lived in the stout and lumpy shadow of Punxsutawney Phil. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhil makes the rounds yearly on the morning talk shows. He&rsquo;s made appearances with Oprah Winfrey and President Ronald Reagan. His agent even scored him a gig with Bill Murray in the 1993 movie &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Wednesday, PolitiFact Georgia scribes rolled our eyes as the public fawned over Phil once again during Wednesday&rsquo;s annual Groundhog Day celebration. Phil never saw his shadow, news accounts said. Spring will come early.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut should you really trust Phil? Beau&rsquo;s website says our metro Atlanta celebrity is accurate 94 percent of the time. Phil&rsquo;s record is a measly 85 percent, it said. That stat has been picked up by various news outlets. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes Beau really deserve second place to that Yankee glory hog?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia decided to settle this matter once and for all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the scoop on Beau&rsquo;s record, we talked to Art Rilling, CEO and founder of Lilburn&rsquo;s Yellow River Game Ranch, an attraction featuring people-friendly wildlife northeast of Atlanta. Beau lives there in a plantation-style manse named &quot;Weathering Heights.&quot; For the past 10 years, his staff has calculated the General&rsquo;s accuracy by noting the number of days local temperatures hit the freezing mark during the six weeks after Feb. 2.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeau, like Phil, predicted an early spring for 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSadly, Phil&rsquo;s staff has not tracked their groundhog&rsquo;s predictions so diligently. Their official stance is that their marmot is &quot;incapable of error, so his accuracy rate is 100 percent,&quot; said Mike Johnston, vice president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWednesday was Punxsutawney&rsquo;s 125th groundhog celebration. German settlers brought the tradition, which is based on ancient myths that say hedgehogs, which resemble groundhogs, have the power to predict the weather.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhil&rsquo;s predictions are not site-specific. If he says that spring will come early, it will, Johnston said. Somewhere.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Phil&rsquo;s really wrong, Johnston added, it&rsquo;s the fault of poor Groundhogeese-to-English translation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;People complain and tell us we&rsquo;re just making it up as we go along,&quot; Johnston said, &quot;but after 125 years of doing it, we don&rsquo;t need to.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we go further, the staff of PolitiFact Georgia feels obliged to mention that meteorologists have officially determined that groundhogs cannot predict the weather.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReally. A tongue-in-cheek analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s National Climatic Data Center concluded groundhogs show &quot;no predictive skill.&quot; (Why do this? To help get kids interested in the science of weather.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOr, more bluntly, &quot;you can&rsquo;t take any stock in a groundhog predicting the weather,&quot; said Tom Ross, a meteorologist who helped put together the NCDC&rsquo;s report. &nbsp;It showed that between 1988 and 2010, Phil gave accurate national weather predictions 10 times out of 23 for a rate of 43 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrue, but that won&rsquo;t stop us. Our groundhog&rsquo;s honor is at stake.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince the keepers of Beau and Phil do not keep comparable statistics, we performed an independent analysis using the NCDC study and National Weather Service data for 2001 through 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe defined &quot;early spring&quot; as a February with above-average temperatures. We then compared each groundhog&rsquo;s prediction with temperatures nationally and in his respective hometown.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NWS does not keep average February temperatures for the hamlet of Punxsutawney, Pa., so a kindly meteorologist gave us figures for Putneyville, Pa., a town at a similar elevation about 15 miles away.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that the General predicted whether spring will start early nationally with 60 percent accuracy. Phil&rsquo;s rate was 30 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeau predicted Atlanta weather with 50 percent accuracy. Phil got Punxsutawney&rsquo;s right 40 percent of the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy our analysis, Beau&rsquo;s staff overestimated his success, but he&rsquo;s still 10 to 30 percentage points ahead of Phil. Georgia&rsquo;s underhog is the champion, paws down. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeneral, emerge from the shadows.
