The same claim appeared on <a href=\"http://yournewswire.com/denzel-washington-orwellian-police-state/\">Your News Wire</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/yournewswirecom/\">frequent purveyor of fake news</a>, Feb. 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Washington made these statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USA Liberty Press article included this alleged quote by Washington: &quot;I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you&rsquo;ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched for that quote in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Washington made that statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t include any alleged quotes by Washington saying Trump avoided war with Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA Liberty Press also repeated a fake quote by Washington praising Trump: &quot;We need more and more jobs. Unemployment is way up here. He&rsquo;s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2016, we fact-checked the claim that Washington said that and found that the story plucked a quote from a March 5 <em><a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/03/05/brother-of-late-civil-rights-activist-medgar-evers-endorses-trump/\">New York Post</a></em> article where Charles Evers, the brother of late civil rights activist Medgar Evers, discussed his endorsement of Trump. Articles circulating on the Internet have falsely attributed the quote to Washington. We rated that statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/16/americanpoliticnews/fake-story-says-denzel-washington-supports-donald-/\">Pants on Fire</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a month later, when speaking before a screening of his new film <em>Fences </em>in Washington, D.C., in December 2016, Washington was asked whom he supported in the election. He quipped &quot;<em>Fences</em>&quot; but later said, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3Xug7Vuig\">&quot;none of your business.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline said that Denzel Washington said, &quot;With Trump we avoided war with Russia&nbsp;and Orwellian police state.&quot; There is no evidence that the actor made that statement. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-24T13:02:32.360620", "ruling_date": "2018-04-24T15:29:26", "ruling_headline": "No, Denzel Washington didn't praise Trump for averting war with Russia", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-denzel-washington-didnt-praise-trump-averting-w", "ruling_link_text": "Fake news about actor", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>USA Liberty Press, <a href=\"http://usalibertypress.com/2018/02/24/with-trump-we-avoided-war-with-russia-and-orwellian-police-state/\">&quot;Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian Police State,&quot; </a>Feb. 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your News Wire, &quot;Denzel Washington: Trump&rsquo;s Election Saved Us From &lsquo;Orwellian Police State,&rsquo;&quot; Feb. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-38923593/denzel-washington-on-fake-news-and-information-overload\">Denzel Washington on fake news and information overload</a>, Feb. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denzel Washington, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS3Xug7Vuig\">&quot;None of your business&quot; interview clip</a>, Dec. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denzel Washington, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRd2f96hJfI\">On Trump and Fake News</a>, Dec. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcklwmCdj5M\">&quot;Did Denzel Washington Say Trump&rsquo;s Election Saved Us From an &lsquo;Orwellian Police State&rsquo;?&quot;</a> Feb. 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/16/americanpoliticnews/fake-story-says-denzel-washington-supports-donald-/\">&quot;Fake story says Denzel Washington supports Donald Trump,&quot; </a>Nov. 16, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian Police State&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2018-02-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
