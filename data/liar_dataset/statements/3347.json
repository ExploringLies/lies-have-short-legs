Bob McDonnell&rsquo;s job creation efforts are disappointing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Feb. 25 news release from the Democratic Party of Virginia cited statistics from a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released that same day showing Virginia&rsquo;s monthly unemployment rates during 2010 averaged out at 6.9 percent. That&rsquo;s a slight increase from the 2009 average of 6.8 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democrats also noted the BLS reported a drop in the state&rsquo;s percentage of working age people with jobs. It fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrian Moran, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, fired out a news release charging the numbers demonstrate &quot;the governor and his team did not even create enough jobs to keep pace with population growth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe dove into the BLS numbers to see if Moran is right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe started with his claim that in 2010 - the first year of &nbsp;McDonnell&rsquo;s term - &nbsp;Virginia&rsquo;s average monthly unemployment rate rose .1 percent to 6.9 percent. That&rsquo;s true, but it provides an skewed picture.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s because when McDonnell was inaugurated in January 2010, the state unemployment rate was 7.2 percent -- its highest point of the year. The rate slowly declined the rest of the year and ended at 6.6 percent by December, ranking Virginia 9th lowest in the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, the unemployment rate improved during McDonnell&rsquo;s first year as governor. And one could make an argument that, when it comes to computing the monthly average for 2010, McDonnell was hurt by a relatively high unemployment rate he inherited from his predecessor, Democrat Tim Kaine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoran doesn&rsquo;t go there. Nor does he mention that Virginia&rsquo;s monthly unemployment rate in 2009 -- Kaine&rsquo;s last full year in office -- increased from 5.7 percent in January to 7.2 percent in December.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not pointing this out to say one governor performed better that the other. Economists have repeatedly told us that governors have a limited impact on employment in their states. We&rsquo;re merely pointing out that there&rsquo;s a variety of ways to interpret these statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia&rsquo;s 6.9 percent unemployment rate for 2010 was far better than the national rate of 9.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s turn to Moran&rsquo;s second assertion, that percentage of working-age Virginians with jobs fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010. His numbers are correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were curious whether the percentage of the state&rsquo;s population with jobs continued to improve throughout 2010 just like the unemployment rate did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo the contrary, the numbers got worse. &nbsp;The percentage of employed working-age Virginians declined from 64.3 percent in January to 63.9 percent in December.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, as Moran says the population growth did indeed outpace job growth in 2010. But is that McDonnell&rsquo;s fault?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHoward Wial, an economist and fellow with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, is dismissive of Moran&rsquo;s use of the BLS statistics to to fault McDonnell.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m not saying the governor is right that he&rsquo;s been a wonderful job creator or that the Democrats are right in saying he hasn&rsquo;t been,&quot; Wial said. &quot;I&rsquo;m just saying that these numbers don&rsquo;t prove anything either way &hellip; They don&rsquo;t show you any connection between public policy and results.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia, with 64.1 percent of its working age population employed last year, out-performed the national average of 58.5 percent. Just like Virginia, the national percentage of working age people who were employed declined by .8 percent from 2009 to 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the end of Kaine&rsquo;s term, the percentage of employed working-age Virginians fell by 1.8 percent -- from 66.7 percent in 2008 to 64.9 percent in 2009. So the same argument Moran uses to disparage McDonnell&rsquo;s performance could also be hurled at Kaine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoran uses two sets of data to prove his point that job growth lagged a rise in population during McDonnell&rsquo;s first year as governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe says Virginia&rsquo;s the average of Virginia&rsquo;s monthly unemployment rates rose in 2010.While technically correct, a month-to-month review shows the unemployment rate was at a high point when McDonnell took office in January and fell throughout the year. Moran&rsquo;s use of the annual unemployment rates is misleading and cloaks that improvement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoran also cites a drop in the percentage of working-age Virginians who were employed last year. The numbers certainly confirm his claim that state job growth did not keep pace with population growth. So he&rsquo;s right on the trend, but it&rsquo;s questionable whether the sluggish job environment can be laid at the feet of a governor who has been in office for a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile there is some truth in Moran&rsquo;s statement, he also uses a misleading figure to paint&nbsp;an inaccurate picture of the jobs situation under McDonnell. We rate the statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-03T14:05:14.291834", "ruling_date": "2011-03-03T13:55:04", "ruling_headline": "Virginia Democratic chairman Brian Moran says Gov.
