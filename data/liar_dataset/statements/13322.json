Rob Portman fired back at former Gov. Ted Strickland&rsquo;s own words about gun rights during the final debate in Cleveland for U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phrase he used -- &quot;mixed and spotty&quot; -- was featured earlier in the campaign season in an attack ad by Fighting for Ohio PAC, a political action committee that supports Portman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Gov. Strickland in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA,&quot; Portman said, when a question was posed to him about the candidates&rsquo; records on gun issues. &quot;I&rsquo;m not talking about years ago, I&rsquo;m talking about this campaign. He has said he has a &lsquo;mixed and spotty&rsquo; record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it. Those are his words, not mine. So I don&rsquo;t know where he is on this issue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we wanted to know if Strickland bragged about a sterling NRA rating in the same campaign in which he acknowledged a spotty record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Fighting for Ohio PAC used the &quot;mixed and spotty&quot; line, we rated its ad <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/may/13/fighting-ohio-pac/fighting-ohio-pac-ad-takes-ted-stricklands-mixed-a/\">False</a>, because Strickland&rsquo;s quote was misleadingly juxtaposed with figures about Ohio&rsquo;s lost jobs and tax hikes under Strickland&rsquo;s governorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman is on firmer ground, because Strickland&rsquo;s &quot;mixed and spotty&quot; remark did emerge in the context of guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland confirmed that he was running for Portman&rsquo;s Senate seat on <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/02/ted_strickland_launches_us_sen.html\">Feb. 25, 2015</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his 12 years as a U.S. Congressman, Strickland opposed measures to restrict gun ownership. So it was <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/12/21/strickland-switches-on-gun-rights.html\">surprising </a>to Ohio political observers when Strickland appeared at forums in Cincinnati and Columbus and talked up measures for more rigorous background checks and prohibiting gun sales to suspected terrorists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ted&rsquo;s views about gun violence and gun safety have been deeply influenced as a result of the multiple horrific incidents of gun violence that our country has suffered, and particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy,&quot; Strickland&rsquo;s spokesman David Bergstein <a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2016/01/14/Gun-votes-issue-in-Democrats-Senate-race.html\">told reporters</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic primary opponent P.G. Sittenfeld questioned whether Strickland&rsquo;s change of heart on guns was motivated by the tragedy or by political timing. A recording more than two years after the attack surfaced that Sittenfeld used to his advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sndu880kryk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">March 10, 2015</a>, Strickland was a guest on WOSU&rsquo;s &quot;All Sides with Ann Fisher,&quot; and took a call from a listener named Jeffrey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">Caller: &quot;Hey there. Gov. Strickland, I know you are a big supporter of the president and when you campaigned for him in 2012 you wrote an article about his support for the Second Amendment. I was just wondering how you continue to say you support the Second Amendment when you have been lobbying for additional gun laws when you were working in D.C.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">Strickland: &quot;Well, I have not lobbied for additional gun laws and, my brother, let me put my record in front of you. As a congressman, I had an A and most of the time an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association. That has been my position, and it is my position.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland had to clarify his stance on guns in a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board interview of Democratic primary candidates for Senate in February 2016. It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMeiMCrsuEs\">taped</a>, and is the source of the &quot;mixed and spotty&quot; line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Has my position changed over time? It has,&quot; Strickland said. &quot;My record is mixed and spotty and I can be criticized for that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman said Strickland &quot;in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA. ... He has (also) said he has a mixed and spotty record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the debate, Portman framed the quote in the proper context about guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90456e35-6985-4c2a-bc0c-a58154ce1922\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90456e35-6985-4c2a-bc0c-a58154ce1922</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-20T20:37:23.574585", "ruling_date": "2016-10-20T22:14:41", "ruling_headline": "Portman quotes Strickland's own words about 'mixed and spotty' record on guns at Ohio debate", "ruling_headline_slug": "portman-quotes-stricklands-own-words-about-mixed-a", "ruling_link_text": "Claim less spotty than previous attack", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Michawn Rich, spokesperson, Rob Portman for Ohio, Oct. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Ohio, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/may/13/fighting-ohio-pac/fighting-ohio-pac-ad-takes-ted-stricklands-mixed-a/\">Fighting for Ohio PAC ad takes Ted Strickland&rsquo;s &lsquo;mixed and spotty&rsquo; quote out of context,&quot;</a> May 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toledo Blade, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2016/01/14/Gun-votes-issue-in-Democrats-Senate-race.html\">Gun votes issue in Democrats&rsquo; senate race,</a>&quot; Jan. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign website, P.G.
