He adds, parenthetically, that &quot;taxes on the bottom 40 percent of the population are actually above the national average.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s undisputed that the two major Texas state and local taxes--sales and property--impose a greater burden on low-income Texans. According to the Texas State Comptroller&rsquo;s latest <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/incidence/96-463TaxIncidence02-11.pdf\">study </a>of tax incidence, issued last month, Texas households earning $29,223 or less are expected to spend 6 percent of their income in general sales taxes and 5.3 percent of their income on school property taxes in 2013. The report says households earning more than $29,223 are likely to spend on average no more than 3.4 percent of their income on each of the two taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe left-leaning Austin-based Center on Public Policy Priorities wrote in 2009: &quot;Texas relies on the sales tax for more than half of all state tax revenue &ndash; a pattern typical of regressive tax systems. Since low- and moderate-income Texans tend to spend all of their income each year to support their families, the sales tax takes a much greater percentage of their income then it does from higher-income families, who can afford to save some of their income or spend it on services that are not subject to the sales tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet do the state&rsquo;s poorest residents also pay higher taxes than the national average?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy e-mail, Krugman told us he based his statement on an analysis released Nov. 18, 2009 by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research arm of Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice, which says it advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study says the 20 percent of Texas families earning less than $18,000 a year spend 12.2 percent of their income on state and local taxes, while the next-wealthiest 20 percent of families, earning $18,000 to $31,000, spend 10.2 percent of income on the taxes, which largely consist of sales and property taxes. Nationally, the poorest 20 percent and next-poorest 20 percent of families spend an average of 10.9 percent and 10 percent of income, respectively, on state and local taxes, the study says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConversely, the study says, the 60 percent of Texas families that earned $31,000 or more put less of their income into state and local taxes than the national average. Texas households in the top 20 percent of income, earning $89,000 or more, paid 5.8 percent of their income or less, while such households nationally paid 8.8 percent or less.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas is among 10 states with &quot;particularly regressive&quot; tax systems, the study says. One result is that low-income families &quot;pay almost six times as much of their earnings in taxes as do the wealthy&quot; and &quot;middle-income families in these states pay up to three-and-a-half times as high a share of their income as the wealthiest families.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe reached Matt Gardner, the institute&rsquo;s director. He said the study drew on data from the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey. He said it was methodologically improved from earlier attempts by the institute to gauge who bears the brunt of state and local taxes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNext, we shared the methodological details that Gardner aired with Billy Hamilton, a former deputy state comptroller of Texas. Hamilton, who was involved in the state&rsquo;s past studies of tax incidence, said: &quot;It sounds like what they did is very logical.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGardner said Krugman&rsquo;s comparison accurately tracks the study. We noticed that the difference between what the second-poorest 20 percent of Texas households pays and the national average looks small; the Texans paid only .2 percent more. Based on a $30,000 annual income, that&rsquo;s $60 more. Though measurable, &quot;it&rsquo;s not a huge difference,&quot; Gardner said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFootnote: Krugman&rsquo;s statement might not have applied to both subsets of lower-income Texans in the past. The institute&rsquo;s previous studies, based on different methodologies and 1995 and 2002 tax payments, similarly showed the poorest 20 percent of Texans paying more than counterparts nationally. But the next-to-poorest 20 percent of Texans paid less of their incomes to state and local taxes than residents in the same income group nationally, Gardner said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Krugman&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-04T14:47:18.195178", "ruling_date": "2011-03-14T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Paul Krugman says poorest 40 percent of Texans pay more in Texas than national average", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-krugman-says-poorest-40-percent-texans-pay-mo", "ruling_link_text": "Close--$60--call", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCenter for Public Policy Priorities, press release, <a href=\"http://www.cppp.org/research.php?aid=926\">&quot;New Report: Texas Taxes on Bottom 20 Percent of Income Earners Fifth Highest in the Nation,&quot; </a>Nov. 18, 2009 (accessed March 1, 2011)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/02282011_paulrkrugmanresponsepftexas.html%20\">E-mail </a>(excerpted), response to PolitiFact Texas, Paul Krugman, oped columnist, The New York Times, Feb. 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy, study, <a href=\"http://www.itepnet.org/whopays3.pdf%20\">&quot;Who Pays?
