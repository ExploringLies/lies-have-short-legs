But porn aside, there was a lot to check out here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted David McGuinn, president of Safe Deposit Specialists, a financial consulting firm that offers training, products and services to the financial industry. He told us he was flooded with phone calls when this claim resurfaced in 2013. He attributes it to the Cyprus financial crisis earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The small Mediterranean country had been in severe recession since 2009, and a banking crisis led to a <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-22/explainer-behind-the-cyprus-financial-crisis/4588736\"><u>rescue package</u></a> from the European Central Bank. The terms of the bailout left the government desperate for cash, so officials <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/business/global/cyprus-makes-fitful-progress-on-bank-bailout-deal.html\"><u>announced</u></a> in March that they would seize a portion of savers&rsquo; assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s when people started warning that something similar could happen in the United States, and the chain email started circulating again, McGuinn told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s no truth to that at all,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs are groups McGuinn listed as potential officials who could force open a box with a search and seizure notice. McGuinn said this process doesn&rsquo;t occur frequently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when officials do open safe deposit boxes, there are safeguards in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rob Rowe, vice president with the American Bankers Association, explained that good cause must be proven in order for the Patriot Act to be used to open a safe deposit box, which is private property. The email in question cited the Patriot Act as the reason the DHS can seize this property, but Rowe said that isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, DHS officials wouldn&rsquo;t be able to open up boxes without bank officials present, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only way to open the box without the renter&rsquo;s key is to drill the lock. If and when a box is drilled, standard bank operating procedures require dual control &ndash; the presence of two officers &ndash; and many jurisdictions also require that the locksmith who drills the box to be specially licensed or certified,&quot; Rowe said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Homeland Security about the issue, an official cited the Fourth Amendment, explaining that searches and seizures by the department may only take place with probable cause and a court-ordered warrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various chain emails over the past seven years have warned readers about the possibility of Homeland Security seizing items like gold, silver and guns from their safe deposit boxes at the bank. This&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t possible without first obtaining a search warrant, since those boxes are private property. And banking officials told us random seizures just aren&rsquo;t happening.
