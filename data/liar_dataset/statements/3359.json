For Texas, the comparable figure was $98 billion, according to information posted online by the bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeLuna told us general expenditures include all money spent by a government in a fiscal year -- net of recoveries and other correcting transactions -- other than for retirement of debt, purchase of investment securities, extension of loans and agency or private trust transactions. She also said the bureau&rsquo;s total closely tracked what the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters, and state comptroller&rsquo;s office would typically say that the state spent in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same year, the U.S. population was estimated at more than 306 million, including nearly 25 million Texans. DeLuna said she reached per-capita spending estimates by dividing the general expenditures by the population estimates. The result: $5,072 for the nation, compared with $3,959 for Texas. Finally, DeLuna said, she calculated what percentage increase would raise the Texas figure to the national average--28 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we checked with the Census Bureau, Cheryl Lee, chief of the state finance and tax statistics branch in its governments division, had no comment on the center&rsquo;s calculation. She said the bureau doesn&rsquo;t pair its finance findings with population data to reach per-capita numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, Austin economist Stuart Greenfield pointed out two other runs at calculating per-capita state spending comparisons, both of them citing information from the bureau and other sources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chart posted online by the Washington-based Tax Foundation says that in 2007, Texas state government spent $3,830 per person in state funds, ranking 50th among the states. That year, the foundation says, the national average was $5,446. Based on those figures,Texas would have needed to boost state spending by 42 percent at the time to draw even. But when we ran this past Mark Robyn, the foundation&rsquo;s staff economist, he cautioned that the 2007 chart is outdated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore recently, a 2009 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows Texas with state spending of $3,630 per person compared to the national average of $5,038--an indication that Texas would have had to increase its spending 39 percent that year to reach the national average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA footnote to the foundation&rsquo;s research posted online says the spending figures were obtained from the National Association of State Budget Officers. DeLuna of the Austin center said the NASBO total doesn&rsquo;t take into account some Texas spending that the census bureau counted, such as extra money for state universities and Food Stamp benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate McCown&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-04T14:39:02.569002", "ruling_date": "2011-03-06T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "In a letter, Scott McCown says Texas would have to increase spending by 28 percent just to reach the national average for spending per resident", "ruling_headline_slug": "letter-scott-mccown-says-texas-would-have-increase", "ruling_link_text": "Might be understatement", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCenter for Public Policy Priorities, <a href=\"http://www.cppp.org/files/6/2011_02_01_Hobby_McCown_Letter.pdf\">open letter</a> to Texas business leaders from F.
