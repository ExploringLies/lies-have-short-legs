The article examined a Rigell ad claim that Nye voted &quot;in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi&quot; 83 percent of the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Nye voted with the Democratic Party about 83 percent of the time, but with Pelosi -- who was House speaker back then -- only 66 percent of the time.
