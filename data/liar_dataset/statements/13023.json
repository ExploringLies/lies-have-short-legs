Or your jeans. Or even under your floor mats. But as governor, Ted Strickland left only 89 cents in Ohio&rsquo;s rainy day fund.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems unlikely that so specific a number would be used without factual underpinning. We wanted to be sure it checked out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In official-speak, Ohio&rsquo;s rainy day fund is known as the Budget Stabilization Fund. When Strickland left office in January 2011, the fund had bottomed out to $0.89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart using data from Ohio&rsquo;s Office of Management and Budget. It shows the ebb and flow of Ohio&rsquo;s reserves, including the low point in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_b2cc2247-a47f-446f-8997-a7b75431f384\" title=\"Ohio rainy day fund\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?8AW\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where&rsquo;d the reserves go?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stickland used $1 billion from the fund to balance the state budget in 2009, a move he and his <a href=\"http://www.tedstrickland.com/news/press-releases/strickland-campaign-releases-new-tv-ad-rainy-day\">campaign</a>&nbsp;have&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-bc-oh--senate-2016-ohio-strickland-20160816-story.html\">defended</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would not have had a rainy-day fund if I had listened to many Republicans,&quot; <a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2009/01/strickland_to_drain_rainyday_f.html\">Stickland said in 2009</a>. &quot;I&#39;m glad I held on to it. There is justification for it now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim Rueben, a state and local finance expert at the Urban Institute, told <em>Columbus Business First </em>that<em>,&nbsp;</em>&quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t blame a governor for spending budget stability funds in a time when you need to stabilize your budget.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the tiny reserve became a bit of Ohio lore. Brian Perera, the Ohio Senate&rsquo;s former deputy chief of staff for budget and finance, <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/the-daily-briefing/2014/10/10-1-14-perera-gone.html\">even</a>&nbsp;cut a check for $0.89 so he can say he personally doubled the state&rsquo;s reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reserve has grown since Strickland left office. Current&nbsp;Gov. John Kasich started to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/07/11/kasich-bolsters-ohios-rainy-day-fund.html\">replenish</a>&nbsp;the rainy day fund with a injection of $246.9 million in July 2011. The money came at the tail end of Strickland&#39;s final two-year budget even though he had left office.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the rainy day fund sits at <a href=\"http://obm.ohio.gov/Budget/stabilizationfund/\">over $2 billion</a>, according to the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign ads criticized Strickland for leaving Ohio&rsquo;s rainy day fund at $.89 when he left office as governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s defenders say the recession that hit the United States and Ohio required Strickland and state officials to drain the $1 billion fund. And they note the fund started to be replenished at the tail-end of his final budget, even though Strickland had left office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we don&#39;t think that affects the accuracy of this claim.&nbsp;We rate it True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ce48995-a59a-4079-94eb-6d03717ebdf6\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ce48995-a59a-4079-94eb-6d03717ebdf6</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-07T17:14:42.975115", "ruling_date": "2016-09-08T13:12:51", "ruling_headline": "Heard the one about Ted Strickland and 89 cents?
