Claire McCaskill has been a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, especially when it comes to protecting pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her opponent, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is part of a lawsuit that is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would take away mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Hawley says he&rsquo;s for protecting this coverage, just not through the current law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their second debate, Hawley mentioned a bill on reinsurance as a way to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The measure is sponsored by Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Susan Collins, R-Maine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCaskill&rsquo;s rebuttal was quite clear:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So who is right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the McCaskill campaign for evidence, which pointed to a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/gop-idea-wont-solve-biggest-problem-with-repealing-obamacare-mandate.html\">CNBC article</a>. We decided to check out the bill for ourselves. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What the bill would do</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When Collins introduced the bill, she said it was &quot;a bill that would allow states to protect people with pre-existing conditions while lowering premiums through the use of these high-risk pools.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the bill doesn&rsquo;t actually contain the words &quot;pre-existing conditions&quot; &mdash; more on that in a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill&rsquo;s actual name is the Lower Premiums Through Reinsurance Act of 2017. It&rsquo;s intended to &quot;reinsure&quot; insurance companies for taking on high-risk individuals. The bill would allow states to design their own reinsurance programs, which would then allow them to be eligible for federal funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill would allocate $4.5 billion over two years, and states could use the federal funding to provide the reinsurance in a way that is up to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At issue is the role of high-risk pools. That&rsquo;s where people who have high premiums would be grouped, regardless of whether they have pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phrase &quot;pre-existing conditions&quot; doesn&rsquo;t show up anywhere in the bill. Instead the bill uses &quot;high-risk&quot; as a qualifier for funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts in health care whom we reached disagreed with McCaskill that pre-existing conditions would have nothing to do with the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anup Malani, professor of law and medicine at the University of Chicago, said that many pre-existing conditions would qualify as a high-risk of using medical care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan B. Cohen, research professor at Boston University, believes there is no straight-forward answer, as reinsurance programs just shift the risk from one entity to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cohen brought up an interesting point that the bill does not mention in the definition of &quot;high-risk&quot; individuals. &quot;It is plausible that a state could define high-risk individuals as those with pre-existing medical conditions, but there is no guarantee that will be the case.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>States would be in charge of making their own definitions of high-risk pools, and deciding whether to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions through this bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So although the Collins referenced pre-existing conditions when speaking on the bill, there is no guarantee that states will be able to protect everyone with a pre-existing condition. Also, this approach relies on adequate funding. States have tried high-risk pools before and they often fell short because they didn&rsquo;t have enough money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill is an incentive for states to reinsure insurance companies to cover individuals who are high-risk. If the government covers the costs of high risk people, then insurance companies could keep low-risk individuals&rsquo; rates low, so the logic goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>McCaskill said, &quot;The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill would help insurance companies cover individuals who are high-risk, which is a category that many pre-existing conditions fall into. While the bill allows the states to make their own decisions -- meaning there&rsquo;s no guarantee that pre-existing conditions will be protected across the board -- it is an exaggeration to say it has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-05T13:03:07.566656", "ruling_date": "2018-11-05T13:40:47", "ruling_headline": "Checking Claire McCaskill on GOP's plan for pre-existing conditions", "ruling_headline_slug": "checking-claire-mccaskill-gops-plan-pre-existing-c", "ruling_link_text": "Claim is exaggerated", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange with Eric Mee, McCaskill spokesman, Oct. 30, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Anup Malani, professor at the University of Chicago, Oct. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Alan B.
