The first False Claims Act, also dubbed the &quot;Lincoln law,&quot; was enacted during the Civil War to combat fraud by companies selling supplies to the Union Army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Georgia and other states have their own False Claims acts, targeting Medicaid fraud. These laws allow states to take civil action against people who swindle money from Medicaid, the state-federal program that covers health care costs for millions of low-income families, the disabled, children and the elderly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But has the state recouped more than $60 million in three years as Lindsey claims? We decided a truth test was in order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicaid fraud can take many forms, but commonly involves billing for services or medications that aren&rsquo;t provided or aren&rsquo;t needed. Overbilling and double billing are other common tactics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big money is at stake. Georgia&rsquo;s Medicaid program doled out about $9.4 billion in the 2013 state fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the state Department of Community Health, which runs the Georgia Medicaid program, officials estimate that $52.2 million was reclaimed through civil proceedings between July 1, 2010, and Feb. 17, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s shy of Lindsey&rsquo;s forecasts, but it&rsquo;s also not the full picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens&rsquo; office has gone after Medicaid fraud, both civilly and criminally. In three years, his office has recouped $159.4 million for both the state and federal government, according to data submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; Office of the Inspector General. Most of that money -- including the $52.2 million counted by DCH -- was reclaimed using the Medicaid False Claims Act, according to Olens&rsquo; office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindsey said he opted for a conservative estimate, based largely on the DCH data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It appears I understated our success,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindsey brought the topic of Medicaid fraud before lawmakers during the recent General Assembly because of a looming deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s Medicaid False Claims Act, which Lindsey sponsored in 2007, had to be amended to comply with new federal regulations. Those amendments, which were approved by lawmakers in Lindsey&rsquo;s House Bill 973, have to be signed into law by April 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, Georgia could lose what&rsquo;s effectively a 10 percent bonus for recovering fraudulently lost federal funds. In the last three years, that 10 percent brought $11.6 million to the state, according to DCH data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much fraud is being perpetrated here and across the nation is a topic for debate. What&rsquo;s generally considered the most credible look at the issue came from the respected Institute of Medicine in 2012. The institute&rsquo;s analysis of 2009 data found that the nation spends $2.6 trillion each year on health care -- including Medicaid and Medicare -- and likely loses $75 billion a year to fraud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our conclusion: Georgia has submitted documentation to the feds that it has recovered $159.4 million lost to Medicaid fraud in three years in both federal and state money. Lindsey was very conservative in saying the amount recouped was &quot;more than $60 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Lindsey&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-27T14:34:33.828707", "ruling_date": "2014-03-28T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lawmaker's claim on Medicaid fraud recovery correct", "ruling_headline_slug": "state-lawmakers-claim-medicaid-fraud-recovery-corr", "ruling_link_text": "Fraud concerns date back to Lincoln's day", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Data from the Georgia Department of Community Health</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from the Georgia Attorney General&rsquo;s Office</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press release from state Rep.
