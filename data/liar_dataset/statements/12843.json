So you&#39;re going to go carpet bomb innocent people and bad people at the same time, and that&#39;s going to help us fight against ISIS and Daesh?&quot; Biden said. &quot;I mean, the things he says are &mdash; are &mdash; are &mdash; make absolutely no sense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carpet bombing is the strategy where the military indiscriminately bombs everything within a predetermined area regardless of whether civilians are present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few hours later, at a news conference, Trump said Biden had lied about his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I never said I wanted to carpet bomb,&quot; Trump responded. &quot;That was Ted Cruz.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who&#39;s correct here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted a Biden spokeswoman but didn&#39;t receive a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we searched the transcripts of major interview shows and Trump rallies and could find no instance where Trump called for carpet bombing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the Republican has repeatedly said he would &quot;bomb the hell out of ISIS,&quot; with no reference to carpet bombing or any comparable tactic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some examples: He&#39;s said he would &quot;bomb the hell out of them&quot; to destroy ISIS&#39;s oil-producing capacity, then send in United States oil companies to take that oil because &quot;there is no Iraq&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4707279?39&amp;search=ZrqXcb6N\">Fox News, June 16, 2015</a>); &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d bomb the hell out of the oil fields. I&#39;d then get Exxon, I&#39;d then get these great oil companies to go in. They would rebuild them so fast your head will spin&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4720399?41&amp;search=ZrqXcb6N\">CNN, July 8, 2015</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4720525?42&amp;search=ZrqXcb6N\">July 8, 2015</a>, exchange with NBC&#39;s Katy Tur:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump: &quot;With ISIS, you kill them at the head. You take the oil. That&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re getting their money. If you bomb the hell out of it, you bomb the hell out of it. You&rsquo;ve got to stop their wealth. They have tremendous wealth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tur: &quot;What about civilians?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump: &quot;I&#39;m talking about oil. I&rsquo;m talking about oil areas. I&#39;m not talking about civilian areas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tur: &quot;Civilians are near oil areas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump: &quot;Oh, give me a break, Katy. Go ahead. Next question.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is also correct that Cruz was the candidate who called for carpet bombing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Texas senator proposed the strategy in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ovRMOl5xRRE?t=14m12s\">a Dec. 5, 2015, speech</a>, promising that &quot;we will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don&#39;t know if sand can glow in the dark, but we&#39;re going to find out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz repeated it several times throughout the campaign but tried to redefine carpet bombing by saying he did not want civilians to be targeted. (PolitiFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misfires-definition-carpet-bombing-gop-de/\">concluded in December 2015</a> that Cruz&#39;s definition, saying that only enemy soldiers would be bombed, was essentially the opposite of carpet bombing.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump was right and Biden was wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also note that Biden isn&#39;t the only Clinton enthusiast to level that accusation against Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four days later, on ABC&#39;s <em>This Week </em>with George Stephanopoulos, retired Marine Corps General John Allen, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4937481?6&amp;search=WkZ4khjR\">made a similar claim</a>. Allen, who spoke at the Democratic convention, has endorsed Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What we do have to do, George, is listen to what (Trump) has been saying about our military,&quot; Allen said. &quot;He&#39;s called it a disaster. He says our military can&#39;t win anymore. That&#39;s a direct insult to every single man and woman who&#39;s wearing the uniform today. He&#39;s talked about needing to torture. He&#39;s talked about needing to murder the families of alleged terrorists. He&#39;s talked about carpet-bombing ISIL.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Who do you think is going to (be) carpet-bombed when all that occurs?&quot; Allen said. &quot;It&#39;s going to be innocent families.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden said that Donald Trump &quot;is going to go out and carpet bomb.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has made it clear that he&#39;s not going to be reluctant to bomb ISIS, but the candidate has not, as far as we could find, called for a practice that includes bombing civilians, which is what carpet bombing can entail. It was another GOP candidate, Ted Cruz, who called for carpet bombing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Biden&#39;s claim as False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f4590925-b207-4146-81aa-f6940c99f7c6\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f4590925-b207-4146-81aa-f6940c99f7c6</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-02T15:09:04.421435", "ruling_date": "2016-08-02T15:57:26", "ruling_headline": "Joe Biden wrong to say Donald Trump has called for carpet bombing", "ruling_headline_slug": "joe-biden-wrong-say-donald-trump-has-called-carpet", "ruling_link_text": "Bomb, but not carpet bomb", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uAy0R8JOWMo?t=14m58s\">Full Speech: Donald Trump Rally in Doral, Florida (July 27, 2016)</a>,&quot;
