And department officials testified at hearings in favor of the legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while Evers played a supportive role he did not, despite the words on the screen in the ad, change the law himself or even take the lead in doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greater Wisconsin Committee says: &quot;When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher&#39;s license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the first part of the claim, the state law in place at the time didn&rsquo;t actually stop Evers from trying to revoke the license who viewed pornography at school. Evers could have initiated revocation proceedings, which the teacher could have challenged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Evers concluded that the law didn&rsquo;t allow for a revocation because the teacher&rsquo;s behavior didn&rsquo;t endanger children. The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator. And two courts upheld the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision. Moreover, the fact that Evers&rsquo; department backed, and Walker signed, a change in the law supports the idea that the law didn&rsquo;t favor revocation at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second part of the claim, Evers did work with lawmakers to change the law, as the narrator states in the ad, but he didn&rsquo;t change the law as words on the screen in the ad claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-23T13:03:26.789750", "ruling_date": "2018-08-29T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hitting back, group defends Dem governor candidate Tony Evers in handling of teacher porn case", "ruling_headline_slug": "hitting-back-group-defends-dem-governor-candidate-", "ruling_link_text": "But words on the screen in the ad don\u2019t match what the narrator says", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYtFvC2Lxbw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Greater Wisconsin Committee TV ad</a>, posted Aug. 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2018/aug/16/third-attack-ad-vs-tony-evers-teacher-porn-has-som/\">&quot;Third attack ad vs. Tony Evers in teacher porn has some of the same problems,&quot;</a> Aug. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/08/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-mostly-misfires-attack-governor-cand/\">&quot;Wisconsin GOP mostly misfires in attack on governor candidate Tony Evers over school porn case,&quot;</a>&nbsp;Sept. 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/06/republican-party-wisconsin/yes-explaining-gops-attack-governor-candidate-tony/\">&quot;Yes, but: Explaining GOP&#39;s attack on governor candidate Tony Evers on not revoking teacher&#39;s license,&quot;</a> Aug. 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/21/tony-evers-and-scott-walker-fighting-over-teacher-who-once-looked-pornographic-material-heres-rest-s/1017892002/\">&quot;Tony Evers and Scott Walker are fighting over a teacher who looked at porn at school &mdash;
