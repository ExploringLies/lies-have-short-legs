(Here&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCPolitics/status/913092714366828576\">video</a> ):</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Trump</strong>: &quot;My plan is for the working people, and my plan is for jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Reporter</strong>: &quot;You wouldn&#39;t benefit under your tax plan?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Trump</strong>: &quot;No, I don&#39;t benefit. I don&#39;t benefit. In fact, very very strongly, as you see, I think there&#39;s very little benefit for people of wealth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump reiterated that his plan was bad news for wealthy taxpayers like him later in his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/27/remarks-president-trump-tax-reform-event\">address in Indianapolis</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They can call me all they want; not going to help,&quot; he said Sept. 27, 2017. &quot;I&#39;m doing the right thing and it&#39;s not good for me, believe me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1421/release-his-tax-returns-after-audit-completed/\">refusal</a> to release his tax returns makes this difficult to know with certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we inquired, the White House reiterated that Trump would not benefit but did not offer any documentation. PolitiFact&rsquo;s longstanding policy is that the burden of proof is on the speaker. We won&rsquo;t back up a speaker&rsquo;s assertion without evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the absence of that, what is known about Trump&rsquo;s taxes suggests that his assertion is highly dubious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, two portions of Trump&rsquo;s tax returns have been leaked to the media. One consists of summary pages from state tax returns from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;_r=0\">1995</a>, which were sent anonymously to the New York Times in 2016. However, because these are state -- not federal -- tax documents, they don&rsquo;t shed much light on this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second and more relevant forms are the summary pages from his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/14/us/politics/document-Donald-Trump-2005-Tax.html\">2005 federal tax return</a>, which were first reported in March by MSNBC&rsquo;s Rachel Maddow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts see three provisions in Trump&rsquo;s proposal that could potentially benefit him.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Scrapping the alternative minimum tax</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This framework substantially simplifies the tax code by repealing the existing individual AMT,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/27/us/politics/document-Read-President-Trump-s-Tax-Proposal.html?_r=0\">Trump&rsquo;s proposal</a> says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A line in Trump&rsquo;s 2005 tax return shows that Trump paid $31,261,179 that year for the AMT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was a large portion of his total tax bill. Had it not been for the AMT, Trump would have owed only about $5.3 million in federal taxes that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if that was an unusually large year for Trump&rsquo;s AMT liability, he is precisely the type of taxpayer the provision was designed for -- someone who is wealthy and who takes a lot of deductions. So if the AMT were to remain in place, it would likely be an ongoing tax burden for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Taxation of &quot;passthrough&quot; income</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s plan would lower to 25 percent the tax rate for &quot;small and family owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations.&quot; Collectively, these are referred to as &quot;passthrough&quot; income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This policy would represent a reduction from the current top rate of 39.6 percent. (An <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses/\">earlier version</a> of the Trump tax plan envisioned the rate going down all the way to 15 percent.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his 2005 tax return, Trump listed more than $67 million in income from &quot;rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, etc.&quot; Even if the proposed changes didn&rsquo;t affect that entire flow of income, some of it likely would, enabling Trump to keep more of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An analysis using Trump&rsquo;s initial 15 percent proposal that was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3680332-4-26-17-Tax-Reform-TP.html\">published by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee</a> said that Trump would save about $28.6 million from the reduction of this &quot;pass-through income&quot; rate. Trump&rsquo;s potential savings would be smaller -- though still substantial -- under the newer proposal of 25 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The estate tax</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s proposal also &quot;repeals the death tax,&quot; which is what many opponents call the tax officially known as the estate tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from taxation, according to the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-estate-gift-and-generation-skipping-transfer-taxes-work\">Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center</a>. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates of Trump&rsquo;s net worth vary; in February, Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/donald-trump/#7b13139a2899\">estimated</a> that it was $3.5 billion. If that&rsquo;s in the ballpark, then under current law, Trump&rsquo;s estate could have to pay tax in the vicinity of $1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, since Trump&rsquo;s estate at his death would almost certainly be worth more than the exemption level of $5.49 million, he would be a good candidate to owe some amount of estate tax, even if it&rsquo;s not as high as $1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the proposed changes to the alternative minimum tax and the taxation of &quot;passthrough&quot; income, the elimination of the estate tax would not be a change that Trump or his heirs could take advantage of immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, if the estate tax were to be eliminated permanently, that would likely offer the Trump family a substantial tax savings down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Referring to his tax proposal, Trump said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t benefit. I don&#39;t benefit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s refusal to release his tax returns makes it impossible to quantify exactly how much he would personally benefit from his policy proposals. But what is known about Trump&rsquo;s past patterns of taxation and his income and wealth holdings strongly suggest that at least three proposed changes -- to the alternative minimum tax, to the tax on &quot;passthrough&quot; income, and to the estate tax -- would benefit Trump or his family either immediately or down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-28T13:20:13.082013", "ruling_date": "2017-09-28T14:39:07", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump's dubious claim that his tax plan won't benefit him", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trumps-dubious-claim-his-tax-plan-wont-bene", "ruling_link_text": "Let's count the ways", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCPolitics/status/913092714366828576\">remarks to reporters on tax legislation</a>, Sept. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/27/us/politics/document-Read-President-Trump-s-Tax-Proposal.html?_r=0\">tax proposal</a>, Sept. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/27/remarks-president-trump-tax-reform-event\">speech in Indianapolis</a>, Sept. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/14/us/politics/document-Donald-Trump-2005-Tax.html\">leaked tax document from 2005</a>, accessed Sept. 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-flow-through-enterprises-and-how-are-they-taxed\">Q.What are flow-through enterprises and how are they taxed?</a>&quot;
