The photo turned up after Hurricane Irene struck <a href=\"https://twitter.com/askjillian/status/107861305901322240\">Puerto Rico</a>. It linked to an <a href=\"http://imgur.com/HiPkB\">Aug. 25, 2011, photo on imgur.com</a> showing the big fish swimming alongside what looks like an SUV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it came back in 2012, with social media users claiming it was taken in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MinhajNazeer/status/263161539677270017\">New Jersey</a> during Hurricane Sandy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, this very same shark had already been spotted in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schlager_jake/status/604463165607313408\">Houston</a> after severe floods.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it somehow swam to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krislynnestowe/status/650673878939926528\">North Myrtle Beach, S.C.</a>, after Hurricane Joaquin later in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where did this really come from? The PhotoShopped image appeared to have taken the shark from a photo that ran in <a href=\"http://www.whitesharktrust.org/media/newsmedia2/africageographic200509p4243.jpg\"><em>Africa Geographic</em> in 2005</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That picture showed a great white shark swimming behind a kayak, and folks on Reddit <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hurricane-irene-photo-of-shark-swimming-in-street-is-fake/2011/08/26/gIQABHAvfJ_blog.html?utm_term=.3395c7dc7914\">noticed the similarities back in 2011</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t believe this fish tale, because it&rsquo;s a hoax that has been luring people for years.
