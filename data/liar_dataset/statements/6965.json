Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, who said in June 2010 that about a third of Texas high school graduates who go to college end up &quot;getting through&quot; college. His statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/jul/13/scott-hochberg/hochberg-says-only-one-third-texas-college-student/\">rated True</a>; our look also quoted an official from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board pointing out that 57 percent of Texas students were graduating within six years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the Republican governor drew his figures from the board, and a board spokesman, Dominic Chavez, guided us to the agency&rsquo;s 2012 <a href=\"http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/download.cfm?downloadfile=56F725D8-D115-B762-952B227D378A2A72&amp;typename=dmFile&amp;fieldname=filename\">&quot;Higher Education Almanac.&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chart in the report says 29.9 percent of Texas students who initially enrolled as full-time students in the state&rsquo;s four-year public colleges and universities graduated within four years. It says 58.4 percent of full-time students graduated within six years, with 65.6 percent doing so within 10 years. Fewer part-time students graduated within the time periods.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChavez said by email that the four-year graduation rate of nearly 30 percent reflects 18,396 graduates out of 61,485 full-time students in the fiscal year running through August 2011 who had enrolled as first-time students four years earlier. Notably, he said, the state can track students who switch schools by tracking them using Social Security numbers or another identifier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the 30 percent rate reflects improvement from the previous decade, Chavez said. By the same measure, nearly 20 percent of fourth-year undergraduates had graduated by August 2000, a rate based on 8,352 graduates among 41,925 fourth-year students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Not only did rate go up,&quot; he said, &quot;but the number of students increased as well.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs noted in our check of Hochberg&rsquo;s statement, two caveats apply. First, the data don&rsquo;t account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include students who attended school out of state, the data don&rsquo;t track whether they graduated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, the U.S. Department of Education also gauges college graduation rates by state. In 2009, its <a href=\"http://www.higheredinfo.org/dbrowser/?level=nation&amp;mode=data&amp;state=0&amp;submeasure=27\">latest figures</a> indicate, 48.5 percent of Texas students who had enrolled six years earlier had earned bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, compared with 55.5 percent nationally.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same year, 25.4 percent of Texas students who had enrolled three years earlier seeking community college associate&rsquo;s degrees <a href=\"http://higheredinfo.org/dbrowser/?level=nation&amp;mode=graph&amp;state=0&amp;submeasure=24\">had succeeded</a>, compared with 29.2 percent nationally. Based on the raw numbers behind each rate, we reached a combined graduation rate of 38 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast to the Texas board&rsquo;s calculation, the federal figures do not account for students who transferred from one institution to another.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Patrick Kelly, who works for the agency that oversees the federal graduation figures, to appraise the Texas board&rsquo;s method of calculating graduation rates. &quot;This makes sense,&quot; he said, calling the approach a straightforward, standard way of tracking students including those who change schools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry said fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years. That information is drawn from the state&rsquo;s higher education oversight agency. We rate the claim as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-19T12:40:05.449113", "ruling_date": "2012-10-19T11:41:22", "ruling_headline": "Rick Perry says less than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years, only 58 percent in six years", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-perry-says-less-30-percent-texas-college-stud", "ruling_link_text": "It's an improvement", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Dallas Morning News</em>, news article, &quot;Perry: Tie funding to college grad rate,&quot; Oct. 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1DgZzmZfBeaCrXtw_rA0JdlBRnSbQm45Vsm8yaPypdVI\">emails</a>, Dominic Chavez, senior director of external relations, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Oct. 3 and 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Information Center for Higher Education Policymaking and Analysis, web posts, <a href=\"http://higheredinfo.org/dbrowser/index.php?submeasure=24&amp;year=2009&amp;level=nation&amp;mode=graph&amp;state=0\">&quot;Three-Year Graduation Rates for Associate Students&quot;</a> and <a href=\"http://higheredinfo.org/dbrowser/?level=nation&amp;mode=graph&amp;state=0&amp;submeasure=27\">&quot;Six-Year Graduation Rates for Bachelor&#39;s Students,&quot;</a> 2009 (accessed Oct. 19, 2012)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Patrick Kelly, senior associate at the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, Boulder, Colo., Oct. 19, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 30, "current_job": "U.S. Energy Secretary", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 42, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 291, "last_name": "Perry", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "rick-perry", "pants_count": 18, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Perry_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/291/", "total_count": 176, "true_count": 26, "website": "https://energy.gov/management/history/secretaries-energy"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press conference.", "statement_date": "2012-10-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
