As he assembles the gun, he talks about how his opponent, Republican Roy Blunt, has attacked his record on guns</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Kander, a former Army captain, says &quot;In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle.&quot; He continues to say, &quot;In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights,&quot; while supporting background checks to keep guns like the AR-15 &quot;out of the hands of terrorists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kander was a Missouri state representative for four years, from 2009 to 2012, before he was elected secretary of state.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We wanted to know more about how Kander handled Second Amendment issues as a representative, so we decided to investigate his claim.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Voting record</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We asked Kander&rsquo;s campaign about his statement, and his staff sent us part of his voting record.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In 2011, Kander voted in favor of a bill that would lower the age &mdash; from 23 to 21&mdash; at which a person could get a permit to conceal and carry a gun. Kander voted against the bill when the House first debated it, but switched for the final vote. The bill became law.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In 2012, he voted to lower the conceal-and-carry age from 21 to 18 for military members. That bill also became law.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>That same year, Kander voted for a resolution that would amend the Missouri Constitution to protect &quot;the right of every citizen to possess, purchase, reload, or manufacture ammunition and any other parts or articles essential to the proper functioning of arms.&quot; The resolution died in a Senate committee.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s only part of the story when it comes to Kander and gun legislation.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund gave Kander an &lsquo;F&rsquo; rating on his advocacy for the Second Amendment for 2016. It provided us with more information about Kander&rsquo;s voting record.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In 2009, Kander voted against a bill that would extend the Castle Doctrine to renters. The doctrine allows a homeowner to use deadly force against a perceived intruder. The bill also would have lowered the age to get a concealed carry permit and would remove a ban on carrying a gun on a college campus.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Kander voted against the &quot;Business Premises Safety Act&quot; four times &ndash; once during each of his terms as a state representative. That bill would have prevented business owners from restricting people from lawfully possessing a firearm in a car on business property.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Both the NRA and incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt, Kander&rsquo;s opponent, have released ads in response to Kander&rsquo;s ad, denouncing his claim that he supports the Second Amendment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>What the Supreme Court says about the Second Amendment</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>So Kander did not support every effort to expand access to guns while serving in the state legislature. That doesn&rsquo;t mean he is against Second Amendment rights.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In a 2010 landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <em>McDonald v. City of Chicago</em> that the Second Amendment prohibition against infringement on the right to &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; extends to state and local governments.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But the court has also ruled in the 2008 case of <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> that some restrictions on guns are acceptable.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In the Heller decision, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, made clear that while D.C. could not ban handguns, the Second Amendment is &quot;not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>He went on to say that some restrictions, like the prohibition of guns in churches and government buildings, were not affected by the court&rsquo;s decision. Carrying a concealed weapon is also subject to regulation.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Kander&rsquo;s votes against expanding access to guns fall within the Supreme Court&rsquo;s definition of allowable regulation of the Second Amendment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>He has never proposed, or voted for, a bill that would repeal the Second Amendment or flout the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interpretation of the amendment, our review found.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_middle\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law and well-known constitutional law expert, said in an email that analysis of Kander&rsquo;s stance on the Second Amendment depends on two questions:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;Does one believe that the Second Amendment protects a right to have guns?&quot; and &quot;Are particular regulations of guns desirable?&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;Even if one believes in the Second Amendment right to have guns, that does not mean that every law to allow more access to guns should be regarded as a good thing,&quot; he said. &quot;Someone could believe in the Second Amendment, but still support some restrictions on guns.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in constitutional law, agreed.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;The Supreme Court has only said that the right protects the right to have a handgun in the home,&quot; he said in an email. &quot;So long as he did not vote to deny law-abiding people that right, then he can reasonably claim to be a supporter of the right to bear arms.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In a TV ad, Kander said, &quot;In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>As a state representative, Kander voted in favor of two bills, which are now law, that would lower the age for someone to conceal and carry a weapon. On the other hand, he also voted against several bills that would reduce regulations on guns.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In short, his gun record is nuanced.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Further, experts cautioned us not to draw a straight line between votes and gun legislation and support for the Second Amendment. It is possible to support the Second Amendment and favor some regulation on guns.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Even though he sometimes voted against bills to expand access to guns, it is fair for Kander to say he supported the Second Amendment as a legislator.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We rate Kander&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/05a77216-92bf-4df3-933b-6d093512c2a7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/05a77216-92bf-4df3-933b-6d093512c2a7</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-06T14:31:38.699682", "ruling_date": "2016-10-06T14:32:54", "ruling_headline": "Kander supported Second Amendment while in office", "ruling_headline_slug": "kander-supported-second-amendment-while-office", "ruling_link_text": "His gun record is nuanced", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jason Kander campaign ad,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wqOApBLPio\">Background Checks</a>, Sept. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roy Blunt campaign ad,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phq4G799GPo\">Only One</a>, Sept. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Amy Hunter, NRA media liaison, Sept. 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Erwin Chemerinsky, Sept. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Adam Winkler, Sept. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Anne Feldman, press secretary for Jason Kander, Sept. 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://house.mo.gov/\">Missouri House of Representatives</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Secretary of State", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jason ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Missouri", "id": 3502, "last_name": "Kander", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "jason-kander", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jason_Kander_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Missouri", "edition": "Missouri", "edition_slug": "missouri", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 51, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Missouri Truth-O-meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/51/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3502/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.jasonkander.com/"}, "statement": "<div>&quot;In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights.&quot;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign ad", "statement_date": "2016-09-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Kander supported Second Amendment while in office"}
