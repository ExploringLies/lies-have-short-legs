George, we&#39;ve spent more than what we&#39;ve brought in for 55 of the last 60 years. This year, the federal government will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country, and yet we&#39;re still going to have a nearly $700 billion budget deficit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boehner&rsquo;s a little off when he said that there have been deficits for 55 out of the past 60 years; it&rsquo;s actually been 51 years out of 60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in this item, we wanted to look at his claim that the government &quot;will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/Table_1-revised_GDP_projections.pdf\"><u>most recent estimate</u></a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects in excess of $3 trillion in revenues for fiscal year 2014. That would be the highest amount of federal revenue in the nation&rsquo;s history when measured by raw dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, that&rsquo;s not the only way to measure federal revenues -- or even the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because using raw dollars doesn&rsquo;t take into account either inflation or the growing economy and population. It&rsquo;s natural that today&rsquo;s economy -- which is larger than ever, and with dollars worth less than they once were -- would produce the largest amount of revenue in raw dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative way of measuring the scale of federal revenues is to measure it as a percentage of gross domestic product. And using this yardstick gives a much different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For fiscal 2013, the just-completed fiscal year, the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/hist01z2.xls\"><u>Office of Management and Budget</u></a> predicted that federal revenues would account for 16.7 percent of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the highest it&rsquo;s been since 2008, the year the Great Recession hit -- but by historical standards, it&rsquo;s low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going back to 1952, revenues as a percentage of GDP were higher than today&rsquo;s level during 55 of 63 years, or 87 percent of the time. Only in eight years was it lower than today&rsquo;s 16.7 percent. It reached a high of 20.6 percent of GDP in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Boehner&rsquo;s office, spokesman Brendan Buck said that what Boehner said &quot;is accurate. If you want to write about revenue as a percentage of GDP, that&rsquo;s a column &ndash; not a fact check.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, experts say the difference between the two measurements isn&rsquo;t trivial. Boehner&rsquo;s argument was that even with historically unprecedented revenues, the United States still can&rsquo;t balance its books. He has a point that the nation does face long-term budget concerns, but framing the question the way he did ignores that current revenues aren&rsquo;t all that massive by historical standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If revenues had been even at historically average levels -- whether due to a stronger economy or a different tax structure -- the deficit might be significantly lower,&quot; said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boehner said that this year, the federal government &quot;will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s true for raw dollars, but raw dollars aren&rsquo;t an especially useful measurement for analyzing long periods of history, because inflation, population growth and economic expansion almost inevitably make the most recent year the largest ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more reliable method -- revenue as a percentage of GDP -- actually shows that revenues today are historically low compared to most of the past six decades. We rate Boehner&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-07T13:31:04.037997", "ruling_date": "2013-10-07T13:55:40", "ruling_headline": "John Boehner says U.S. will have record revenues this year", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-boehner-says-us-will-have-record-revenues-yea", "ruling_link_text": "In raw dollars yes; as share of GDP, hardly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>John Boehner, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/week-exclusive-interview-john-boehner-20486985\"><u>interview on ABC&rsquo;s </u><u>This Week with George Stephanopoulos</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4357768\"><u>Oct. 6, 2013</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/Table_1-revised_GDP_projections.pdf\"><u>CBO&#39;s Baseline Budget Projections, as of May 2013, With Percentages of GDP Updated to Reflect Recent Revisions by the Bureau of Economic Analysis</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/hist01z2.xls\"><u>Table 1.2&mdash;Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930&ndash;2018</u></a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/hist01z1.xls\"><u>Table 1.1&mdash;Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789&ndash;2018</u></a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tara Sinclar, George Washington University economist, Oct. 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Brendan Buck, spokesman for John Boehner, Oct. 7, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "Speaker of the House of Representatives", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 49, "last_name": "Boehner", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-boehner", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnboehner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/49/", "total_count": 69, "true_count": 17, "website": "http://www.speaker.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;This year, the federal government will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on ABC's \"This Week\"", "statement_date": "2013-10-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
