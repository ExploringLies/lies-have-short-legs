I have known Bill when he was drinking and I have known Bill when he was not drinking.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>By the time of his sentencing, Bill will have been sober for 270 days. Being sober has had a profound impact on Bill for the better. I also think it is important to recognize that Bill became sober under his own volition. Bill became sober to improve his life, not because he was sent to a court-mandated program.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I believe this change has improved Bill&rsquo;s life considerably.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club for Growth spokesman Bob Pipkin defended the group&rsquo;s claim by referring us to <a href=\"https://www.wisconsingazette.com/news/wisconsin/vukmir-sent-letter-supporting-gop-legislator-convicted-of-sexual-assault/article_77be7a2e-d86e-11e7-b3d1-eb46442961aa.html\">an article</a> about the disclosure of Vukmir&rsquo;s letter in the Wisconsin Gazette, which describes itself as a progressive, alternative newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We took the interpretation of a liberal Wisconsin newspaper; they interpreted it as leniency,&quot; he told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A caption to a photo with the article says Vukmir sought leniency, although the headline and the first sentence of the article merely said Vukmir sent a letter supporting Kramer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mattias Gugel, a Vukmir campaign spokesman, told us: &quot;The accusation that Leah wrote a letter asking for leniency is a blatant lie. She simply spoke about a colleague seeking help for addiction issues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not as though Vukmir&rsquo;s letter would have been seen by the judge as urging a harsher sentence for Kramer rather than a lighter one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also sought views from two lawyers based in Waukesha County, where Kramer is from and where the crime occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Criminal defense lawyer <a href=\"https://www.buting.com/Attorneys/Jerome-F-Buting.shtml\">Jerome Buting</a>, known for his work on the case made famous by the film <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/crime/making-a-murderer-compelling-but-is-it-a-game-changer-in-steven-avery-case-b99647809z1-364794271.html\">&quot;Making a Murderer,&quot;</a> said Vukmir&rsquo;s letter does seek leniency:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you write a letter on behalf of a defendant at sentencing, most of the time I think it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that&rsquo;s seeking leniency, whether it&rsquo;s expressed that way or not. You&#39;re trying to convey to the judge that this one incident doesn&rsquo;t necessarily portray everything about his (the defendant&rsquo;s) character, and that is one of the big factors the court has to consider in sentencing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bucherlawgroup.com/attorneys/paul-e-bucher\">Paul Bucher</a>, who does criminal defense work and is the former district attorney in Waukesha County, disagreed, saying some letters explicitly ask for leniency or no jail time and Vukmir&rsquo;s doesn&#39;t:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We do character letters all the time because all the court really knows about the client is what is in the criminal complaint. So, the job of a defense &nbsp;lawyer is to give the judge a broader picture of who is standing in front of him. (Vukmir&rsquo;s letter is) a pretty standard, boilerplate, character letter.</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even if it doesn&rsquo;t go far as some, Vukmir&rsquo;s letter clearly was written to help Kramer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club for Growth says Vukmir &quot;wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that letters written on behalf of criminal defendants facing sentencing cover a range. Vukmir&rsquo;s letter to the judge in Kramer&rsquo;s case is limited to Kramer&rsquo;s character. It doesn&rsquo;t go as far as some letters in such cases that explicitly ask for leniency or lighter treatment, such as probation rather than jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while the word leniency might mean different things to different people, it&rsquo;s clear that Vukmir&rsquo;s letter was written to benefit Kramer &mdash; in other words, seeking a lighter sentence, rather than a harsher one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Club for Growth&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This item was corrected on July 18, 2018, after it was first published, to clarify the Club for Growth entities.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-16T15:54:22.202419", "ruling_date": "2018-07-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Senate candidate Leah Vukmir seek 'leniency' for fellow lawmaker convicted of sexual assault?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-seek-leniency-fel", "ruling_link_text": "Such character-reference letters seek a lighter sentence, rather than a heavier one", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFFfpCRTcG0\">Club for Growth TV ad</a>, July 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Leah Vukmir campaign spokesman Mattias Gugel, July 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leah Vukmir letter to Waukesha County Circuit Court, Nov. 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/12/01/u-s-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-wrote-letter-behalf-lawmaker-convicted-sex-assault/911489001/\">&quot;U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir wrote letter on behalf of lawmaker convicted of sex assault,&quot;</a> Dec. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/rep-bill-kramer-sentenced-to-5-months-in-jail-for-groping-incident-b99397840z1-283887871.html/\">&quot;Rep.
