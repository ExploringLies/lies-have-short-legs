Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would do a better job than President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger: &lsquo;I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??&rsquo;&quot; <a href=\"https://www.coloradopost.site/arnold-schwarzenegger-i-would-be-a-better-president-than-trump-2020-wait-for-me-do-you-agree/\">said the headline</a> of a Sept. 9 story posted on coloradopost.site, which doesn&rsquo;t appear to be affiliated with the newspaper Denver Post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could not find a verbatim quote of Schwarzenegger saying, &quot;I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2017 Schwarzenegger, a vocal Trump critic, suggested that he and Trump switch jobs. &quot;Hey, Donald, I have a great idea: why don&rsquo;t we switch jobs, you take over TV, because you&rsquo;re such an expert in ratings and I take over your job and then people can finally sleep comfortably again, hmm?&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/827169996866347008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E827169996866347008&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.com%2Farnold-schwarzenegger-better-president-donald-trump-governator-apprentice-host-2485322\">Schwarzenegger said</a> in a video posted on Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text in Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s tweet said, &quot;The National Prayer Breakfast?&quot; That day Trump delivered a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-national-prayer-breakfast/\">speech</a> at the National Prayer Breakfast and mocked Schwarzenegger for low ratings on the NBC show <em>The Apprentice.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump in January 2017 also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/817348644647108609\">taunted</a> Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s ratings compared to Trump&rsquo;s time on the show. In response to that tweet, Schwarzenegger <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schwarzenegger/status/817386215921958912?lang=en\">tweeted</a>: &quot;I wish you the best of luck and I hope you&#39;ll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond Colorado Post&rsquo;s headline, there&rsquo;s no indication in the story of when or where Schwarzenegger purportedly said that he would be a better president than Trump &mdash; and to wait for him in 2020. (Schwarzenegger is ineligible for the U.S. presidency since he is not a natural-born U.S. citizen. He was born in Austria.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story rather talked about the causes and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and said Schwarzenegger &quot;definitely hates Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Shocking confession of Arnold Schwarzenegger made us think of his big hate,&quot; the story said. &quot;A few day (sic)&nbsp;ago we say headlines of him telling Trump has PTSD.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coloradopost.site does not include any information on its website detailing who&rsquo;s behind it or a way to contact its operators. (There are fields to post a comment to the story.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence of Schwarzenegger saying exactly what the site claims &mdash; including to wait for him in 2020. Making up quotes, even if the some of the sentiment has been expressed before, is a big no-no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the headline&nbsp;False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-18T11:21:24.956865", "ruling_date": "2018-09-18T15:09:08", "ruling_headline": "Did Arnold Schwarzenegger say he would be a better president than Trump, might run in 2020?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-arnold-schwarzenegger-say-he-would-be-better-p", "ruling_link_text": "Not verbatim, Terminator can't run for presidency", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Coloradopost.site, &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger: &quot;I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me DO YOU AGREE??&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, @realdonaldtrump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/817348644647108609\">tweet</a>, Jan. 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WhiteHouse.gov, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-national-prayer-breakfast/\">Remarks by President Trump at National Prayer Breakfast</a>, Feb. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, @Schwarzenegger <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/827169996866347008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E827169996866347008&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.com%2Farnold-schwarzenegger-better-president-donald-trump-governator-apprentice-host-2485322\">tweet</a>, Feb. 2, 2017; tweet, Jan. 6, 2017 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schwarzenegger/status/817386215921958912?lang=en\">tweet</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger: &#39;I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-09-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
