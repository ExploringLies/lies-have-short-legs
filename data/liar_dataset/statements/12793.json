We did the math using square miles and found that there is actually one Border Patrol agent per every 23.77 square miles in Arizona. That comes out to .4 agents per every 10 square miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Terry-Willis&rsquo; math is off. But Border Patrol notes that trying to use the state&rsquo;s total square miles as a statistic is irrelevant since most agents are deployed far to the south, closer to the border. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fiscal year 2015, the Tucson, Ariz., sector had 3,991 Border Patrol agents covering 262 linear miles of border. That&rsquo;s just over 15 agents per mile. The Yuma, Ariz., sector had 804 Border Patrol agents covering 126 linear miles of border. That&rsquo;s just over six agents per mile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sectors cover the more than <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/us/arizona-primary-immigration.html\">360 total miles</a> along the Arizona-Mexico border, as well as the rest of the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Border Patrol also notes that agents are deployed to areas based on the threat of criminal activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their 2012-16 strategic plan, they even outline a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/bp_strategic_plan.pdf\">risk-based approach</a>&quot; to patrolling the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Lytle, a criminal justice professor and border security expert at the University of Texas at Brownsville, notes that there are some agents in more places along the border than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology, terrain and other barriers could be at play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Patterns of activity shape a section of the border, and may not necessitate the presence of an officer on that particular milemarker,&quot; Lytle said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Terry-Willis said, in Arizona,&quot;there are only one and a half (Border Patrol) agents per every 10 square miles.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our calculations, she actually overestimates the number of Border Patrol agents compared to square miles. But that&rsquo;s still misleading -- and leaves out important context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Border Patrol agents survey areas closer to the Arizona-Mexico border, not the rest of the state. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/09e06b8f-2783-494a-bf52-bfb4f264e462\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/09e06b8f-2783-494a-bf52-bfb4f264e462</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-27T14:57:03.031396", "ruling_date": "2016-08-04T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sister of Border Patrol agent killed near Arizona border claims there are few agents ", "ruling_headline_slug": "sister-border-patrol-agent-killed-near-arizona-bor", "ruling_link_text": "Border math that doesn't square", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC15, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/fq7l_lUTdbI?t=2m40s\">Republican National Convention LIVE FROM ARIZONA: Kent Terry and Kelly Terry-Willis</a>,&quot; July 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC15, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/region-central-southern-az/tucson/2-men-to-be-sentenced-in-2010-killing-of-us-border-agent\">Two men sentenced in 2010 killing of U.S. border agent</a>,&quot; Dec. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The New York Times, </em>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/us/arizona-primary-immigration.html\">Presidential candidates woo Arizona voters on immigration</a>,&quot; March 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/bp_strategic_plan.pdf\">2012-2016 Border Patrol Strategic Plan</a>,&quot; accessed July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Rice University Mexico Center director Tony Payan, July 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with University of Texas at Brownsville criminal justice professor Michael Lytle, July 25, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kelly", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3616, "last_name": "Terry-Willis", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "kelly-terry-willis", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/KellyTerryWillis.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Arizona", "edition": "Arizona", "edition_slug": "arizona", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 56, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Arizona Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/56/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3616/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.honorbrianterry.com/"}, "statement": "<p>In Arizona, &quot;there are only one and a half (Border Patrol) agents per every 10 square miles.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Republican National Convention video", "statement_date": "2016-07-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
