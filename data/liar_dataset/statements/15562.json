W. Bush is not dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 1, the hoax news site New York Timely Reports posted that he had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Former President George H. W. Bush has died at the age of 94, a spokesman said in a statement Sunday afternoon,&quot; <a href=\"http://nytiwes.com/george-h-w-bush-has-died-at-94/\">the article said</a>. &quot;According to Bush&rsquo;s spokesman McGrath, the former president died &lsquo;peacefully in his afternoon nap.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook&#39;s News Feed. Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do we know this claim is false?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, the last time a former president died was Dec. 26, 2006. That was the day Gerald Ford passed to his reward. Within 24 hours, there were 221 news articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For George H. W. Bush on July 1, 2018? Zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The president&rsquo;s spokesman Jim McGrath posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jgm41\">nothing on his Twitter account</a>. If he was releasing a statement to the press as the article said, then for sure he would have done the same on Twitter. His most recent tweet was from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jgm41/status/1011401132919459840\">June 26</a> with a letter from Bush supporting Houston&rsquo;s bid to host the 2020 Democratic convention. The day before, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jgm41/status/1011401132919459840\">retweeted</a> a story about Bush getting a new dog named Sully. Former president Bill Clinton was there to welcome the dog, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush has his own Twitter account. He congratulated the Republican gubernatorial primary winner in Colorado on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeHWBush/status/1012106614441160704\">June 27</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also tweeted about the dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, the surviving former presidents include Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Timely Reports has a web address of www.nytives.com, which is one letter off from the New York Times website address, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com\">www.nytimes.com</a>.
