Starting in 2022, Medicare would no longer directly <a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medicare-benefits/medicare-benefits-overview.aspx\">help pay </a><a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medicare-benefits/medicare-benefits-overview.aspx\">for</a> doctor visits, hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Rather, future Medicare participants would choose a private insurance plan and Medicare -- through what are called premium-support payments or vouchers -- would help pay for the insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/\">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy, <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/upload/8183.pdf\">noted</a> that in the days after Ryan&rsquo;s budget plan was released, three national polls found Americans divided on such a change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://petri.house.gov/profile2.shtml\">Tom Petri</a>, R-Wisconsin, was conducting his annual survey of constituents. In his April 2011 <a href=\"http://petri.house.gov/NewsletterMay2011.pdf\">newsletter</a>, the 32-year Fond du Lac congressman posed this question to residents in the <a href=\"http://petri.house.gov/about.shtml\">6th District</a>, which is north and west of Milwaukee:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;One of the recommendations put forth by the president&rsquo;s debt commission was to convert the Medicare system from a government-run insurance program to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market. Would you support such a change?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat left us with this question: Did a commission created by a Democratic president recommend the same sweeping change to Medicare that was part of the House GOP budget?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe debt commission mentioned in Petri&rsquo;s question -- the <a href=\"http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/\">National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform</a>-- was formed by an Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-national-commission-fiscal-responsibility-and-reform\">executive </a><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-national-commission-fiscal-responsibility-and-reform\">order</a> in February 2010. The <a href=\"http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/members\">18-member</a> panel included Ryan, who was appointed by Republican leaders of the House of Representatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe commission was charged with making recommendations to balance the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The recommendations came in a <a href=\"http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/TheMomentofTruth12_1_2010.pdf\">report</a> issued in December 2010. This is what Petri&rsquo;s survey question cited in saying the commission recommended a voucher program for Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe word voucher appears only once in the commission&rsquo;s 66-page report, as part of Recommendation &quot;3.3.13.&quot; The recommendation addressed <a href=\"http://www.opm.gov/insure/health/\">Federal Employees Health Benefits</a>, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe commission said the insurance should be made into a premium-support or voucher program. Federal retirees could use their voucher to pay part of their Medicare premium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that is for a limited group, federal employees and retirees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat is not transforming all of Medicare into a voucher program. Had that recommendation been made, it undoubtedly would have stirred the same criticism that the Republican plan has.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe commission&rsquo;s report noted that two commission members -- Ryan and <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/experts/rivlina.aspx\">Alice Rivlin</a>, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton -- had proposed converting Medicare into a voucher system. The commission&rsquo;s view was that such a system &quot;holds significant promise of controlling costs, but also carries serious potential risks.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe commission suggested that, if its recommendation were put in place to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a premium-support or voucher program, &quot;that experience would be useful in considering a premium-support program for Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the president&rsquo;s commission recommended trying a voucher program with federal employees and retirees and then, based on the results, deciding whether to try it with Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter we contacted Petri&rsquo;s office on May 6, 2011, spokesman Niel Wright said the wording in the constituent survey question about Medicare was incorrect. He said the question should have stated that the president&rsquo;s commission &quot;discussed,&quot; rather than recommended, making Medicare a voucher program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso after our call, this note was added to the electronic version of the survey question on Petri&rsquo;s website:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;CORRECTION: The question above is somewhat misleading. Instead of saying that the recommendation was &lsquo;put forth&rsquo; by the president&#39;s debt commission, the question should read that this recommendation was &lsquo;discussed&rsquo; by the president&#39;s debt commission.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWright told us that when Petri&rsquo;s office distributes results of the survey, a note will be included &quot;indicating that a problem with this question was brought to our attention,&quot; as would &quot;additional information clarifying how the question should have been phrased.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWright also said the survey was reviewed by the <a href=\"http://ethics.house.gov/Subjects/Topics.aspx?Section=127\">Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards</a>, also known as the Franking Commission, and that &quot;neither the Republican nor the Democratic staffers at the commission noticed anything objectionable&quot; or partisan. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurning to the Truth-O-Meter, in surveying constituents, GOP Congressman Tom Petri said a commission created by the Democratic president had recommended making Medicare a voucher program. The commission did not make that recommendation and Petri admitted the wording in his survey was wrong.
