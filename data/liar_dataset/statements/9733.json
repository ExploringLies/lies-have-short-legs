And education spending, Bloomberg said, is the best evidence of big things to come in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;China has looked at it and said this is a place where because they are spending highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world, although in all fairness it&#39;s starting small,&quot; he said. &quot;But you are going to create a middle class there that&#39;s going to want an awful lot of the products.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The next big cities,&quot; he said, &quot;are going to be in Africa.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That seemed to contradict the Western trope that African schools aren&rsquo;t meeting the needs of their students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found is that Bloomberg is in the ballpark looking at data from 2008 but wrong when looking at more recent numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Looking back to 2008</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we didn&rsquo;t hear from Bloomberg, he may have been thinking of an <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-31/how-the-u-dot-s-dot-can-rival-china-in-africa\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>article in his<em> </em></u><em><u>Bloomberg Businessweek</u></em></a><em> </em>by Howard French, author of <em>China&rsquo;s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;African investment in education, among the highest in the world in terms of percentage of GDP, can barely keep up with the heavy demand for learning,&quot; French wrote, going on to cite Africa&rsquo;s recent gains in school enrollment across all levels of learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French referred us to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/africa/lions_on_the_move\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies.&quot;</u></a> That report pegs Africa&rsquo;s public spending on education as a percentage of GDP at 5 percent in 2008. That&rsquo;s &quot;a smaller portion than the OECD countries&rsquo; 6 percent,&quot; they wrote, &quot;but more than in Latin America or some Asian countries.&quot; The OECD, or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, &nbsp;is composed of 34 countries in every continent except Africa that are generally considered developed and high-income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CghIUzgUIDfjAvppqSrwEdVGFUPQuceVEWXc0ki9xG_VV438_lGfKpc9Fgj5Z3ofrYYqsBq4kdK0Qo3OLcxpw9LFwfoVhPmJBryzbqU9xDaH5VnHVtXBHWNL7ejJgp3QfQ\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0rad); border:none; height:257px; transform:rotate(0rad); width:580px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above graph from <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/Finance_EN_web.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report</u></a> expands on the data from the McKinsey study and looks at spending per region across the globe. Both reports, we should note, only look at public spending on education -- data on private education spending isn&rsquo;t readily available for non-OECD countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you take education spending as a percentage of government spending, not GDP, Africa actually beats out the OECD, 20 percent to 11, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. But looking at 2008 figures -- as did all the reports we found that looked at education spending for continents -- Bloomberg&rsquo;s wrong. Africa&rsquo;s close, and their progress on education is impressive by other measures, but the world&rsquo;s developed nations spend proportionally more on education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Updating the data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But part of the buzz about Africa is that its governments are rapidly increasing their spending on education. For instance, a <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38203#.U-Jkn_ldV1A\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2011 UN report</u></a> noted that Africa had increased its education spending by an average of 6 percent a year from 2000 to 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2008 data also isn&rsquo;t perfect, because some notable countries are missing, including China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we set out to update the UN and McKinsey&rsquo;s analysis with more recent data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year, UNESCO publishes public education spending as a percentage of GDP for every country where it&rsquo;s available, which works out to less than half of the 196 recognized countries almost every year. The World Bank keeps <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GB.ZS\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a database of these numbers, year-by-year.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To update the stats from UNESCO and McKinsey, we took the World Bank&rsquo;s dataset and removed every country that hadn&rsquo;t published new data since 2008. Then we took the most recent figure for the remaining 160 countries, and multiplied each country&rsquo;s percentage by its most recent <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>GDP figure from the World Bank</u></a> to get an estimate for total education spending for each country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data for every country is the most recent available, though the data isn&rsquo;t the same year for every country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then broke down the countries into geographic regions using a <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/wpp/excel-Data/country-Classification.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>UN classification</u></a> -- which segregates countries more or less by continents -- and took the total education spending for each region and divided it by each region&rsquo;s total GDP to get weighted averages.

But since then, Africa&rsquo;s overall economic growth has outpaced its governments increasing spending on education. Our calculations based on the most recent available data put Africa&rsquo;s proportional spending beneath every continent except Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>African countries do spend more of their governments&rsquo; budgets on education than many developed countries, so Bloomberg&rsquo;s broader point about Africa&rsquo;s growth has some merit. But Bloomberg&rsquo;s claim cited GDP.
