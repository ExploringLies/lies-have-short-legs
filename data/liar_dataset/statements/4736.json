So, naturally, we read with interest the Taxpayer Association of Oregon&#39;s Fall 2011 &quot;Government Waste Watch Report.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe weren&rsquo;t a paragraph in and already something had caught our attention. The report noted that &quot;The City of Portland alone has 84 public relation representatives on payroll, which cost taxpayers over $6.2 million.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Oregonian had just published a story pegging the number of state employees working in communications at 125, or 220 if you include managers and people in design shops.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSure, Portland is the state&rsquo;s largest city by far, but 84 for the city alone?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report cited the source for the number as a <a href=\"http://wweek.com/portland/article-17536-giving_us_flack.html\">Willamette Week story from May</a>. We did some googling and found the original article. Just a few paragraphs in and you get the salient info:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are a lot of them (public relations employees) &mdash; 94 in the Portland area &mdash; and their paychecks add up to nearly $7 million a year &hellip; these public-relations &nbsp;people work for the City of Portland, Metro, Portland Public Schools, Multnomah County, the Port of Portland, Portland State University, TriMet and Oregon Health &amp; Science University.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust a couple sentences further and the writer, James Pitkin, addresses Portland specifically: &quot;The biggest PR team belongs to the City of Portland. It spends $2.1 million paying its 28 PR people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s sizable, but it&rsquo;s hardly the 84 that the Taxpayer Association cited in its critique.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWillamette Week also posted a list of the folks that they identified as being on the payroll in communications positions. We called Portland&rsquo;s Bureau of Human Resources to see if we could confirm the names.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bureau sent us a copy of a public records request dated July 14, 2011 that listed 25 employees. We reconciled the two lists and found that Willamette Week included the Portland Development Commission, bumping their figure of 28 employees. With the PDC, their salaries were closer to $2.1 million, not $6 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called the Taxpayer Association to see what was up. Jason Williams, the executive director, said the mistake was theirs. While typing up the newsletter, they confused the city&rsquo;s figures with the Portland-area figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, he said, even 28 public relations employees was too many. &quot;Eighty-four is even too much even for the whole state. If government is doing its job, it doesn&#39;t need a press agent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe fact that Williams admitted their mistake gets the association some brownie points, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that they were misinforming the 10,000 people who receive their watch reports. And it doesn&rsquo;t change our ruling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe give this claim a False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/11/does_portland_really_have_84_p.html\">Return to OregonLive to comment on this statement and ruling.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-03T20:37:57.900841", "ruling_date": "2011-11-04T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Does Portland really have 84 PR people on staff?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-portland-really-have-84-pr-people-staff", "ruling_link_text": "That many may work in the city, but they don't all work for the city", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTaxpayer Association Oregon, Fall 2011 Government Waste Watch Report<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWillamette Week, <a href=\"http://wweek.com/portland/article-17536-giving_us_flack.html\">Giving us Flack</a>, May 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWillamette Week, <a href=\"http://www.wweek.com/portland/file-162-.pdf\">breakdown of Portland&rsquo;s public relations staff</a>, May 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCity of Portland, break down of communications-related positions, Nov. 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Jason Williams, Executive Director of the Taxpayers Association of Oregon, Nov. 3, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "political action committee", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 813, "last_name": "Taxpayer Association of Oregon", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "taxpayer-association-oregon", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-Anonymous_people___.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/813/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.oregonwatchdog.com/stage/whoweare.htm"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays &quot;the City of Portland alone has 84 public relation representatives on payroll which cost taxpayers over $6.2 million (a year).&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a newsletter", "statement_date": "2011-10-31", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 203, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/203/", "subject": "City Government", "subject_slug": "city-government", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
