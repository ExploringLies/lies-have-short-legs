He gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown. Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer. And on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The conservative choice is clear: John Cox for governor.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJB2jix_f-U\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The ad was&nbsp;paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll examine the other two attacks on Allen in future fact-checks. In this piece, we&rsquo;ll focus on the claim he donated to top Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background on GOP rivals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent polls show growing support for Cox&rsquo;s campaign for governor, less than a week after President Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/997597940444221440\">endorsed</a> the San Diego businessman. A survey <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/publication/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-their-government-may-2018/\">released Wednesday night</a> from the Public Policy Institute of California shows Newsom, the state&rsquo;s lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent, &nbsp;State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/john-cox/\">Cox</a> and Allen have sparred at campaign events over who is the most conservative candidate. They&rsquo;ve both criticized California&rsquo;s Democratic leadership over the gas tax increase and sanctuary state protections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Donating to Democrats?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad accuses Allen of donating to three of the state&rsquo;s top Democrats. The irony, of course, is that Allen&rsquo;s run for governor has centered on criticizing those same politicians, particularly Brown and Newsom. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found clear evidence supporting the claim, though Cox&rsquo;s ad ignores the fact that the contributions took place nearly a decade ago, before Allen ran for elected office, and that he also donated to Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign finance records show that in October 2010, Allen donated $1,000 to Jerry Brown for Governor, through Wealth Strategies Group, his wealth management firm in Huntington Beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2010, Allen gave $100 to Gavin Newsom for Lieutenant Governor. And, in October 2010, he donated $250 to Barbara Boxer for Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/11790906/Travis%20Allen%20screen%20shot%20donations.JPG\" style=\"height:260px; width:1188px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>SOURCE: Campaign finance records from the California Secretary of State&#39;s <a href=\"http://powersearch.sos.ca.gov/\">website</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about this, a spokeswoman for Allen&rsquo;s campaign said in an email that the contributions took place &quot;before Travis was an elected official, as a businessman, he purchased tickets to some events.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A November 2017 Mercury-News <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/07/travis-allen-governor-assembly-donations-democrats-jerry-brown/\">article</a> summarized these and additional donations Allen made to Democrats in 2010 and 2011. He told the paper at that time: &quot;As a businessman I was invited to some events by friends, and I purchased tickets to these events. Attending these events, however, opened my eyes to the damage the Democrats were doing to California, and brought about my decision to do everything in my power to stop them, including running for public office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Similar claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2016, PolitiFact California rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/may/03/ted-cruz/yep-donald-trump-gave-12k-jerry-brown-gavin-newsom/\">Mostly True</a> a similar claim about then Presidential candidate Donald Trump donating to Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, at the time Trump&rsquo;s rival for the Republican presidential nomination, claimed Trump &quot;has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign finance data showed the claim was accurate, though we noted Cruz left out that the donations took place long before Trump announced his run for president. The contribution to Jerry Brown took place in 2006, while the donations to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJB2jix_f-U\">TV ad</a>, John Cox&rsquo;s campaign for governor claimed rival GOP candidate Travis Allen donated to three of California&rsquo;s top Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign records prove the claim, though the contributions took place a decade ago, before Allen entered politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs this clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-25T13:45:16.854983", "ruling_date": "2018-05-25T11:02:26", "ruling_headline": "Did a GOP candidate for California governor really donate to Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-gop-candidate-california-governor-really-donat", "ruling_link_text": "Campaign finance records prove claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>John Cox for Governor 2018, &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJB2jix_f-U\">Compare&rsquo; TV ad</a>, accessed May 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt Shupe, spokesman for John Cox for Governor 2018, email exchange May 23</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maryann Marino, spokesman for Travis Allen for Governor 2018, email exchange May 24</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mercury-News</em>, <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/07/travis-allen-governor-assembly-donations-democrats-jerry-brown/\">GOP candidate for governor Travis Allen donated to Gavin Newsom and other Democrats</a>, Nov. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact California, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/may/03/ted-cruz/yep-donald-trump-gave-12k-jerry-brown-gavin-newsom/\">Yep, Donald Trump gave $12K to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom &amp; Kamala Harris</a>, April 30, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/campaign/\">campaign finance website</a>, accessed May 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Election Commission, <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?10021070076\">$250 contribution to Barbara Boxer for Senate</a>, Oct. 27, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "candidate for California governor", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "California", "id": 4082, "last_name": "Cox", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "john-cox", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/John_Cox_mug_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4082/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Republican candidate for California governor Travis Allen &quot;gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign ad", "statement_date": "2018-04-23", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 165, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/165/", "subject": "Negative Campaigning", "subject_slug": "campaign-advertising", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "<p>The &ldquo;Tracking The Truth,&rdquo; project will fact-check claims in the 2018 California governor&rsquo;s race.
