Now it&#39;s $60. That&rsquo;s $40 you have in your pocket &mdash; every American that would fill up at a pump station &mdash; that you wouldn&rsquo;t have.&quot; (The comment is around the 7:20 mark in <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?441473-5/conservative-political-action-conference-secretaries-perry-zinke\">this C-SPAN video</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have gas prices fallen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to come up with a 40 percent decline &mdash; but the decline came under President Barack Obama, not President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the federal Energy Information Administration, the peak gasoline price under Obama was $3.96 a gallon in mid May 2011. The low price under Trump was $2.33 &mdash; the week he was inaugurated in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a 40 percent decline, but the drop came entirely on Obama&rsquo;s watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the final two and a half years of Obama&rsquo;s tenure, the average gallon of gas went no higher than $3.50. It hit a low of $1.73 in February 2016, lower than at any point in the Trump presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Trump, the price at the pump has trended upward. From $2.33 at Trump&rsquo;s inauguration, it rose to $2.56 in mid February 2018. That&rsquo;s an increase of almost 10 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the full data for gasoline prices under Obama and Trump:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Did Trump&rsquo;s pro-resource development policies make a difference?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably not on gasoline prices so far, experts say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the ramp-up in oil production that benefited consumer prices occurred during what critics have derided as Obama&#39;s &quot;war on fossil fuels,&quot; said Severin Borenstein, a professor of business administration and public policy at the University of California-Berkeley&#39;s Haas School of Business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that Trump policies on drilling may make a difference going forward. &quot;To the extent that looser environmental regulations allow greater oil production in the future, that will increase downward pressure on oil prices, and gasoline prices,&quot; Borenstein said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the future price drops from Trump policies may not be massive. &quot;Increased oil production in the United States has put some downward pressure on crude prices, though that is hardly the only factor in the decline of gasoline prices,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Interior Department did not get back to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Zinke said, &quot;Under the previous administration it was &hellip; $100&nbsp;to fill a car.
