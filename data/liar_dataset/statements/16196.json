It also has the highest crime rate in Florida. And this is a guy who has taken a pledge attacking our men and women in law enforcement. He will not standby them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few moments later, Hannity said he had read that Gillum was &quot;not a big fan of police.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeSantis responded, &quot;He said police and prisons have no place in justice. It&rsquo;s outrageous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum is the Democratic candidate for Florida governor and the mayor of Tallahassee. He&rsquo;s up against DeSantis, a former congressman backed by President Donald Trump. We&rsquo;ve looked at<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/oct/08/andrew-gillum/andrew-gillum-says-crime-dropping-tallahassee/\"> DeSantis&rsquo;</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/oct/08/andrew-gillum/andrew-gillum-says-crime-dropping-tallahassee/\">Gillum&rsquo;s claims </a>about Tallahassee&rsquo;s crime rate as well as attacks on Gillum about an <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2018/oct/31/city-tallahassee-most-corrupt-florida-president-tr/\">FBI probe</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum never said that &quot;police and prisons have no place in justice.&quot; When we asked the DeSantis campaign what their evidence was, they pointed&nbsp;to Gillum&rsquo;s relationship with the group Dream Defenders. We&#39;ll explain the connection, but Gillum never said those words.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The pledge</div>\r\n\r\n<p>DeSantis <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonDeSantisFL/status/1058027248014503936\">often</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonDeSantisFL/status/1053293523620032512\">zeroes</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonDeSantisFL/status/1054757113153622017\">in</a> on the social justice group Dream Defenders, a group that has raised concerns about racial profiling since the 2012 death of <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2013/jul/15/fact-checks-about-case-involving-trayvon-martin-an/\">Trayvon Martin</a>, the young unarmed African-American teenager shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum&rsquo;s support for the Dream Defenders goes back to the group&rsquo;s formation, although both the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article218998125.html\">Dream Defenders </a>and <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article218738860.html\">Gillum</a> have said they do not share the entirety of each other&rsquo;s platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Gillum spokesman <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article218998125.html\">told the Miami Herald</a> in late September that the Dream Defenders were leaders for the struggle for social justice in Florida, but that Gillum did not agree with several of the group&rsquo;s positions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers agreed, telling the Herald that the Dream Defenders were &quot;more left-leaning&quot; than Gillum and that they disagreed on topics including the role of police and prisons, the functionality of borders and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen DeSantis said Gillum signed a pledge attacking law enforcement, he was referring to the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1faB5sYe3O0VNwaKYd6hxu0PdlzkdiRkz/view\">Freedom Papers elected officials pledge</a>. This pledge is a two-page document that calls on those who sign it to pledge not to take a penny from the NRA or the Geo Group, a private prison operator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will fight for a Florida that divests from prisons, detention centers, guns and police and invests in the basic needs and safety of its people, especially its children,&quot; the pledge stated. &quot;I will fight for a reallocation of our state budget from police and prisons to good food, affordable housing, quality health care and public education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum signed the pledge in June 2018, along with the three other Democratic gubernatorial candidates at the time, according to Dream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers. The candidates signed the pledge following a debate co-hosted by the Dream Defenders. Summers said 30 Florida politicians have signed the pledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Freedom Papers elected officials pledge is a different document than the Freedom Papers, a longer document that outlines the Dream Defenders&rsquo; views in more detail. However, the two-page elected officials pledge contains the line, &quot;I pledge my support to the Freedom Papers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dreamdefenders.org/freedompapers\">The Freedom Papers</a> is a 20-page document that makes a series of statements about social and economic issues, particularly those that affect poor people, minorities and immigrants. The papers raise concerns about underpaid teachers, income inequality, rent hikes and calls for open elections and an end to violence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Freedom Papers document includes a few paragraphs that are highly critical of police and prisons, stretching back to the days when police helped catch escaped slaves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Police and prisons have no place in &#39;justice,&#39;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dreamdefenders.org/freedompapers\">this longer document stated</a>. &quot;Police and prisons aren&rsquo;t just racist but they work to enforce the separations of rich and poor.
