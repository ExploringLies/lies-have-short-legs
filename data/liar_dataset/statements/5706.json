John Kasich has had both setbacks and victories since taking office in January 2011, but a Fox News interview on April 2 gave him the chance to focus on success.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We were the number one job creator in America in February,&quot; he told anchor Neal Cavuto, &quot;and we are now the number four job creator in the last year&quot; -- claims that PolitiFact Ohio checked and rated as True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich went on to tout the state&#39;s fiscal progress, saying, &quot;Our rainy day fund has gone from 89 cents to $240 million.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s quite a swing. We wondered about the numbers, and especially about that bargain-basement figure of 89 cents. We asked Kasich&#39;s office for verification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpokesman Rob Nichols referred us first to the Office of Budget and Management. Lest we search and not find, it promptly corrected us that it&#39;s not really the &quot;Rainy Day Fund&quot; but the less colorful &quot;Budget Stabilization Fund.&quot; (Bob Dylan didn&#39;t write &quot;Budget Stabilization Women #12 &amp; 35.&quot;)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOBM issued a statement last July saying that $246.9 million had been transferred from general revenue into the Budget Stabilization Fund, giving it a balance of $246.9 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did the arithmetic with the exact numbers and found the starting balance was $1.78. It&#39;s the opening balance for the current fiscal year, according to OBM&#39;s summary of fund activity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich&#39;s number of 89 cents is half of that. The governor explained the difference near the end of his State of the State address in February:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When I came in,&quot; he said, &quot;we had a rainy day fund that had 89 cents, and I&#39;m told that budget guru over there, Brian Perera, sent an 89-cent check to double the amount of money we had in the rainy day fund.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerera is budget director of the Senate Republican caucus and an acknowledged expert on state finances. The same story about him appeared almost a year ago in the blog Ohio Budget Watch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was true, he told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rainy day fund, which was drained by the recession after topping a billion dollars, was left in April 2011 with a balance of 89 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeeing an opportunity few of us could resist, Perera wrote himself into state legend by writing a check to the state for 89 cents and doubling the fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich actually understated the fund&rsquo;s latest balance, as of March 30, when he &nbsp;rounded it to $240 million. The 89 cents was accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis statement rates as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-09T14:45:30.290809", "ruling_date": "2012-04-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
