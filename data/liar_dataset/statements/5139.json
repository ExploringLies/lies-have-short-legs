Scott Walker&rsquo;s reforms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe billboards hit on a theme voters undoubtedly will hear over and over from Republicans if Barrett takes on Walker in a possible recall election in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe billboards refer to Walker&rsquo;s controversial budget legislation that took health care and pensions out of collective bargaining for most public employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat allowed local governments and schools to impose cost-sharing for those benefits instead of negotiating with labor leaders.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett&rsquo;s campaign, reacting to <a href=\"http://www.todaystmj4.com/multimedia/videos/?bctid=1365860807001\">the</a><a href=\"http://www.todaystmj4.com/multimedia/videos/?bctid=1365860807001\"> ad</a>, denounced it as completely off base, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45877823/ns/local_news-milwaukee_wi/t/conservative-group-posts-mayor-barrett-billboards-around-milwaukee\">in a statement to </a><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45877823/ns/local_news-milwaukee_wi/t/conservative-group-posts-mayor-barrett-billboards-around-milwaukee\">WTMJ4 </a>that said: &quot;The only thing accurate about that billboard is the picture of Tom Barrett.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s the truth?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClub for Growth didn&rsquo;t respond, but the Journal Sentinel reported in August that the city of Milwaukee will indeed save $25 million in 2012 just on health care costs, in large part by asking employees to pay more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Barrett&rsquo;s budget document said revisions to the city&rsquo;s health insurance -- the ones made easier by Walker&rsquo;s changes -- would help drive overall health care costs down for the first time in more than 20 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted the same Milwaukee budget official quoted in August 2011, and he told us the city still expects a $25 million drop in health costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCase closed?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe official, city economist Dennis Yaccarino, says the $25 million actually overstates savings related to the Walker budget alone. He said city officials didn&rsquo;t make that clear in early August when a Journal Sentinel reporter first got the number from the city and published the $25 million figure in the context of Walker&rsquo;s changes. That <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/127269673.html\">story </a>ran Aug. 8, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe newspaper followed up <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/128160178.html\">August 21, 2011</a>, quoting city officials saying $6 million of that savings number was from the city&rsquo;s own decision to switch from an insured HMO to a self-funded approach due to projected cost savings. The $6 million switch is noted that way in Barrett&rsquo;s budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe move, we should note, was negotiated with the city&rsquo;s largest union two years ago but was not put in place until now for reasons unrelated to the state budget, according to Yaccarino and Richard Abelson, executive director of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, which represents general city employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYaccarino said the city calculated in 2011 that it was paying a profit to its carrier and could keep the money for itself by going self insured. That scenario had not existed until 2011, hence the delay, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo that leaves $19 million of savings for Milwaukee from Walker&rsquo;s original budget plan and the amended one he signed, right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot exactly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRemember, the $25 million figure is just on the health care costs side fo the equation. What about public employees paying more in pension costs? That&rsquo;s the second part of Walker&rsquo;s limits on collective bargaining over benefits. Milwaukee didn&rsquo;t put them in place due to questions about the legality of the state changes as they apply to Milwaukee. So that&rsquo;s a 0.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, city official note Walker&rsquo;s overall budget cut municipal aid, leaving the net &quot;savings&quot; to the city much reduced from $19 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the billboard refers to Walker&rsquo;s &quot;reforms,&quot; which is the changes tied to &nbsp;the collective bargaining issue. It is making a narrower claim, on how much was saved from the reforms, not how the city fared overall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur conclusion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBillboards say Walker&rsquo;s &quot;reforms&quot; allowed Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to save $25 million for the city.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe city is that much ahead, but a portion was Barrett&rsquo;s doing before Walker&rsquo;s budget was enacted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-13T18:34:28.562462", "ruling_date": "2012-01-15T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Club for Growth says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett saved $25 million in the city budget thanks to Governor Scott Walker's reforms", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-club-growth-says-milwaukee-mayor-tom-bar", "ruling_link_text": "You're welcome, Mr. Mayor", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div>\r\n\tWTMJ-TV, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45877823/ns/local_news-milwaukee_wi/t/conservative-group-posts-mayor-barrett-billboards-around-milwaukee/\">&quot;Conservative group posts Mayor Barrett billboards around Milwaukee</a>,&quot; Jan. 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Dennis Yaccarino, city economist, Jan. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Cullen Werwie, press secretary to Scott Walker, Jan. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Jodie Tabak, Barrett spokeswoman, Jan. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel,<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/127269673.html\">&quot;Milwaukee to see net gain for budget</a>,&quot; August 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/128160178.html\">Barrett gets little clarity on pension law</a>,&quot; August 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "", "id": 29, "last_name": "Club for Growth", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "club-growth", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-club4growth.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/29/", "total_count": 21, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.clubforgrowth.org/"}, "statement": "<div style=\"background-color: transparent;\">\r\n\t&quot;Mayor Barrett saved Milwaukee $25 million, thanks to Gov.
