(their home) on a smaller scale. There is a very identifiable Somali community. I might add if you come to the train station with me you&rsquo;ll notice I have great relationships with them because there&rsquo;s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine. For real. I&rsquo;m not being solicitous. I&rsquo;m being serious.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short order, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/17/politics/joe-biden-somali-cabs/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CNN</u></a> interviewed some Wilmington cab drivers who said they know of drivers from some African countries such as Ghana and Liberia, but none from Somalia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen any (Somalis) in Delaware,&quot; Anthony Eber, a taxi company owner who emigrated from Sierra Leone, told CNN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Biden know something no one else seems to know? Apparently not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau&rsquo;s latest <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_B04001&amp;prodType=table\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>American Community Survey</u></a> did find some Delaware residents with Somali ancestry -- it estimated that there were a whopping 15 Somalis in the entire state of Delaware. That&rsquo;s less than two one-thousandths of 1 percent of the state&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that&rsquo;s &quot;very identifiable,&quot; it would help to have a microscope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare that with Minnesota, which has the United States&rsquo; <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_5YR_B04001&amp;prodType=table\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>largest</u></a> Somali population, at more than 35,000. Meanwhile, Biden&rsquo;s home-away-from-home, the Washington, D.C., metro area, ranks in the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/population/foreign/files/acsbr12-16_supptab2.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>top five for Somali populations</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refugees from the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>east African country</u></a> started coming to the United States en masse in the 1990s, after a civil war broke out. Today, al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida affiliate Islamic terrorist group, is a major source of instability in Somalia and a <a href=\"http://refugeesinternational.org/where-we-work/africa/somalia\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reason</u></a> why refugees continue to flee to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, roughly 90,000 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States since 2000, according to the <a href=\"http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/refugee-arrival-data\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement</u></a>. However, Delaware has not received any of them, according data from the same office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jewish Family Services of Delaware is the state&rsquo;s largest refugee resettlement organization. On their website, there&rsquo;s a list of nearly <a href=\"http://www.jfsdelaware.org/Emigre.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>40 countries</u></a> from which refugees have been resettled. About half of those are African countries, but Somalia is not one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilmington is part of the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, which has one of the higher rates of foreign-born residents from Africa, according to the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/acs/acsbr12-16.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>American Community Survey</u></a>. But even in this expanded geographical area, the vast majority are from African countries other than Somalia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of Delaware&rsquo;s foreign-born population, only 9.5 percent are from the African continent -- about 8,000 people in all -- and most of those are from West Africa, according to the survey report. And of those 8,000, just 4 percent work in &quot;transportation and warehousing, and utilities,&quot; the category that includes taxi drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s office did not respond to a query. His office also didn&rsquo;t reply by publication time to our friends at the <em>Washington Post</em> Fact Checker, which gave Biden their worst rating -- <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/19/bidens-strange-claim-of-knowing-an-awful-lot-of-somali-cab-drivers-in-delaware/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Four Pinocchios</u></a> -- for this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden said &quot;there is a very identifiable Somali community&quot; back home in Delaware. If so, it&#39;s minuscule: The Census Bureau estimates that there&rsquo;s only 15 Somali people living in Delaware. Biden&rsquo;s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous.
