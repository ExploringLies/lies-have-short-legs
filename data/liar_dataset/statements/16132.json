Multiply $1,000 by 100,000 and you get $100 million -- not the $3.4 million Rogers said he had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, if you performed a reverse Google image search of the picture Rogers included, you would find that this image, and gimmick, has been used before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Twitter user @calebproera used the same image <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CalebProEra/status/1054242573995393024\">in a post Oct. 22</a>. It popped up on a different <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anzeigekamrein/photos/a.781459268629398/1724931597615489/?type=3&amp;theater\">Facebook timeline with the same message on Oct. 8</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you searched the caption Rogers wrote, you would see the same post <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/177571949546123/photos/a.177573662879285/277280669575250/?type=3&amp;theater\">from a different Facebook user</a> Oct. 8 and another version <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abaewho/status/1048682128064614400\">from a different Twitter user Oct. 6</a>.
