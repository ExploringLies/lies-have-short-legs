Golden, a state representative, is looking to unseat two-term incumbent Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Golden <a href=\"http://www.sunjournal.com/new-republican-television-ad-targets-jared-goldens-positions-and-his-tattoos/\">claims</a> the ad was is false. Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The claim&rsquo;s origins</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The super PAC&rsquo;s claim refers to a<a href=\"https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0384&amp;item=10&amp;snum=127\"> state law</a> passed in 2016 that limits people on Maine Temporary Assistance for Needy Families from using Electronic Benefits Transfer cards to purchase a laundry list of items, including tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This state law passed Maine&rsquo;s House of Representatives<a href=\"https://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/rollcall.asp?ID=280055776&amp;chamber=House&amp;serialnumber=645\"> 206-38</a> with bipartisan support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Golden was one of the 38 representatives who voted against the bill. He<a href=\"http://www.sunjournal.com/new-republican-television-ad-targets-jared-goldens-positions-and-his-tattoos/\"> told the Sun Journal</a> he opposes misuse of welfare funds, but the state-level restrictions were unnecessary because federal rules already prohibit using welfare money for items like tattoos, tobacco and alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Golden spokesman Bobby Reynolds said just because Golden voted against that bill, it doesn&rsquo;t mean he voted in favor of using welfare dollars for controversial purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reynolds said that if the bill failed, Mainers would still be barred from using TANF funds to purchase those items under federal rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was a solution in search of a problem,&quot; Reynolds said. &quot;To be clear, Jared Golden opposes the use of SNAP and TANF for such purchases.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Maine&rsquo;s 2016 law is more restrictive than federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/112/plaws/publ96/PLAW-112publ96.pdf\"> Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012</a> requires states to maintain policies and practices to keep EBT cards from being used at liquor stores, casinos or adult-oriented entertainment establishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal law does not restrict transactions at grocery stores that sell alcohol or that have &quot;gaming activities.&quot; It also does not regulate how cash that has been withdrawn with an EBT card can be used. Maine&#39;s 2016 law also does not address cash withdrawals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would be virtually impossible to effectively monitor and implement such a restriction,&quot; Schott said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2012 federal law also does not mention tattoos or tobacco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maine&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0384&amp;item=10&amp;snum=127\"> 2016 law</a> expanded TANF EBT card purchase restrictions to also include tobacco products lotteries, bail, firearms, ammunition, vacation or travel services, tattoos and obscene materials or entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Poliquin campaign declined our request to comment on the content of the ad, saying the campaign had no control over the ad and no role in its creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congressional Leadership Fund claims that Golden voted in favor of welfare recipients using tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Golden voted against a 2016 bill that limited EBT card purchases, saying federal law already covered the issue. Golden did not vote in favor of a measure that would expand EBT card use to those items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression.
