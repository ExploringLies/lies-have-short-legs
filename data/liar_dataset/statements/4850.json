Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUOM9QvhG5I&amp;feature=player_embedded\">30-second </a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUOM9QvhG5I&amp;feature=player_embedded\">version</a> gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a <a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">four-minute </a><a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">version</a> that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this item, we&rsquo;ll check one of the two claims from the 30-second version -- whether Romney has changed his position on abortion. We&#39;ll look at other aspects of the ad in separate items.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney, unlike the other GOP contenders, has attracted early attention from the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama, largely due to Romney&rsquo;s status as the nominal frontrunner in the GOP primary. But Romney has faced years of accusations about being a flip-flopper, most recently in a television <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhyMplwY6HY\">ad</a> by one of his primary rivals, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked Huntsman&rsquo;s abortion-related charges from that ad, so we&rsquo;ll recap them here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&bull; &nbsp;In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, &quot;I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country.&quot; Referring to the <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\">1973</a><a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\"> Supreme Court </a><a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\">decision</a> that made abortion legal in every state, Romney added, &quot;I believe that since <em>Roe v. Wade</em> has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&bull; &nbsp;In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, &quot;I will preserve and protect a woman&#39;s right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWe believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWhat about his views today? The &quot;issues&quot; portion of his website doesn&rsquo;t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57269.html\">op-ed</a> in the conservative <em>National Review </em>that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, because it is bad law and bad medicine. <em>Roe </em>was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. &nbsp;This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tAbortion opponents may disagree on exactly where on the anti-abortion spectrum Romney falls, and <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3279653&amp;page=1\">questions</a><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3279653&amp;page=1\"> have been </a><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3279653&amp;page=1\">raised</a> about how fully and quickly Romney made his ideological transition after the event he cites as the spark -- a meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tStill, we believe these issues are outside the scope of the claim in the DNC ad. Romney&rsquo;s views on abortion are vastly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. The DNC&rsquo;s claim that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rates a True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-28T13:59:39.846642", "ruling_date": "2011-11-28T13:59:12", "ruling_headline": "DNC ad says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion", "ruling_headline_slug": "dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-abortion", "ruling_link_text": "An old Mitt and a new Mitt on abortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic National Committee, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUOM9QvhG5I\">Mitt v.
