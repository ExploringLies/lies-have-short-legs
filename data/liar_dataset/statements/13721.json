Richard Blumenthal, D- Conn. Cuomo had interviewed Blumenthal after the senator made headlines by saying that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch had told him he was &quot;disheartened&quot; by the president&rsquo;s dismissive comments about federal judges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blumenthal drew Trump&rsquo;s wrath first. The president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829660612452036608\">tweeted</a>, &quot;Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo&rsquo;s turn came next. After he spoke with Blumenthal, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829681034564341760\">tweeted</a> on Feb. 9, 2017, &quot;Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave &quot;service&quot; in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, Cuomo did ask about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN posted <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ins-NcVwkto\">Cuomo&rsquo;s interview</a> with Blumenthal. Cuomo&rsquo;s first question was: &quot;What is your response to the president of the United States saying you should not be believed because you misrepresented your military record in the past?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blumenthal didn&rsquo;t answer the question. Instead, he repeated his account of what Gorsuch said to him. The interview moved on to details about the Gorsuch nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Trump took his shot at Cuomo, the CNN anchor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN/status/829689725581656066\">defended</a> himself on air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The president, with all due respect, is once again off on the facts,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;He just said, &lsquo;You never asked him about it.&rsquo; I did. He ducked it, and that&rsquo;s okay. Politicians duck things all the time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back. If they do respond, we will update this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vietnam legacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Blumenthal and Trump avoided serving in Vietnam, but while Trump never claimed to have been there, Blumenthal did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/nyregion/18blumenthal.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;\">New York Times</a></em> reported that at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, &quot;We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.&quot; &nbsp;In 2003, Blumenthal spoke at a rally supporting troops overseas. &quot;When we returned, we saw nothing like this,&quot; he said, a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blumenthal told the <em>New York Times</em> he had &quot;misspoken&quot; about his Vietnam record. In reality, between 1965 and 1970, he received at least five deferments for military service. In 1970, he obtained a slot in the Marine Reserves and was stationed in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2015/jul/21/was-trump-draft-dodger/\">reported</a> before, Trump benefited from four student deferments in college and one medical deferment (Trump later said that was for bone spurs in his heels), before being classified 4-F, unfit to serve. Trump played baseball, tennis and squash during his college years. He once <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/us/politics/donald-trump-likens-his-schooling-to-military-service-in-book.html?_r=0\">said</a> attending a private military-style boarding school gave him &quot;more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Cuomo failed to ask Blumenthal about his &quot;long-term lie&quot; about his service in Vietnam. The video record shows that Cuomo asked Blumenthal to respond to the charge that he lacked credibility after misrepresenting his military record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo might not have mentioned Vietnam, but he certainly brought Blumenthal&rsquo;s past distortions into the conversation. Cuomo could have pressed Blumenthal with follow-up questions, which he failed to do. But he did ask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/58a74cc9-0557-43fb-b0b9-45ba9de64db1\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/58a74cc9-0557-43fb-b0b9-45ba9de64db1</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-09T14:06:38.845657", "ruling_date": "2017-02-09T14:49:26", "ruling_headline": "Trump wrong on  Sen.
