Ultimately,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/puerto-rico-debt-rescue-plan-engulfed-in-great-recession-bailout-politics/2016/04/30/3608cc46-0dbe-11e6-a6b6-2e6de3695b0e_story.html\">a judge</a>&nbsp;would have the power to reduce the $72 billion in debt, according to the&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experts we consulted agreed with Ryan, who has said the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico, given that it would not commit any U.S. funds to the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the experts also agreed with U.S. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a critic who&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dailysignal.com/2016/04/27/gop-fights-over-whether-puerto-rico-rescue-plan-is-a-bailout/\">has said</a>&nbsp;the bill would function like a bailout because Congress would be &quot;changing the rules&quot; to benefit Puerto Rico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rules would change under the bill in that Puerto Rico could restructure its debt, similar to what is done in a so-called Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and pay less to some creditors than the creditors are owed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the impact on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/national/qa-puerto-ricos-debt-crisis-explained-mjsurnpublicidaporg7c8cb300ffc448ecb7d5b4f466b02683-377766781.html\">American investors</a>, many bond funds have already sold their Puerto Rican debt, and the debt is now mostly owned by hedge funds, according to the Associated Press. But Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton still own part of the debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, a restructuring almost certainly would mean that Americans who, through brokers or choices they made in their retirement accounts, put some of their savings into Puerto Rican bonds almost certainly will get a lower return on their money, the experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is one more consideration, said&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/detail/?id=41226\">Simon Johnson</a>, a professor of global economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans who invested in Puerto Rican bonds thinking they were safe overestimated how safe they are, as the island&rsquo;s debt crisis shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an Oversight Board managing a debt restructuring, savers likely will get a lower return than they expected. But without such a board, creditors would be fighting in court and the returns for individuals investors would likely be lower still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center for Individual Freedom, a Super PAC, says in a TV ad that Ryan backs a proposal that would be a &quot;bailout&quot; of Puerto Rico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is misleading in its repeated use of the word bailout, in that legislation supported by Ryan -- unlike past bailout bills -- would not direct any U.S. tax dollars to the debt-ridden island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the ad was careful to say the &quot;bailout&quot;
