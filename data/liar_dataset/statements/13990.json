Clarke has not ruled out a run, but hasn&rsquo;t expressed strong interest, either, while a number of Republicans have. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For her part, Baldwin has said Clarke is <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/daniel-bice/2017/03/13/bice-sen-tammy-baldwin-says-sheriff-david-clarke-being-groomed-senate-bid/99107026/\">&quot;being groomed&quot;</a> to challenge her, and has raised campaign funds herself off his possible candidacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a favorite of the right, Clarke has drawn criticism for his racial remarks as well as for his performance as sheriff as he increasingly spends time on national television and traveling the country on speaking engagements. He has also said virtually nothing about four inmate deaths in the jail he manages that are under investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to the statement about what Clarke said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Hate group&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black Lives Matter formed after a Florida jury in 2013 found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen. <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Describing</a> its aim as rebuilding &quot;the black liberation movement,&quot; the group has participated around the country in demonstrations, <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/black-lives-event-urges-unitarians-to-fight-for-racial-equality-b99653101z1-365545561.html?ipad=y\">including</a> <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/blake-lives-matter-group-protests-at-mayfair-mall-b99760799z1-386548731.html\">some</a> around Milwaukee, about police killings of black people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke called Black Lives Matter a &quot;hate group&quot; in a July 2016 opinion <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/07/11/sheriff-david-clarke-its-time-to-stand-up-to-black-lives-matter.html\">column</a> he wrote for FoxNews.com and has made any number of similar references such as these:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;I wish the Southern Poverty Law Center would add them (Black Lives Matter) to the list of hate groups in America &hellip; this hateful ideology of Black Lives Matter.&quot; -- Fox News&rsquo; <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/07/31/sheriff-clarke-black-lives-matter-should-be-classified-hate-group\">&quot;America&rsquo;s News HQ,&quot;</a> July 31, 2016</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;Black Lives Matter are purveyors of hate.

But it&rsquo;s a conglomeration of misfits. You have Occupy movement, you have organized labor in on it now, you have criminals, you have black racialists, you have cop haters and anarchists have now formed together this faux movement, if you will.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Terrorist movement&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke hasn&rsquo;t used a terrorism reference nearly as often, but he does so twice in his book:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Black Lives Matter does not &quot;care about black lives.

You&rsquo;d never heard of these incidents. That&rsquo;s because the media protect and lie about this <a href=\"https://www.academia.org/sheriff-david-clarke-cop-under-fire/\">insidious terror organization</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke also predicted on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sheriffclarke/status/659197285172166657?lang=en\">Twitter</a> in 2015 that Black Lives Matter &quot;will join forces with ISIS to being (sic) down our legal constituted republic.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in a July 2016 <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/sheriff-david%20clarke-black-lives-matter-baton-rouge-civil-war\">column</a> he wrote for The Hill, he said: &quot;We have several forces internal and external attacking our rule of law: ISIS, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street &ndash; just the most recent iterations of the elements who brand themselves as unique but seek the same revolutionary aim: take down the West &hellip;&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says that Clarke said Black Lives Matter &quot;is a terrorist movement, a hate group and calls it, Black LIES Matter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke has repeatedly used Lies instead of Lives in labeling the group, and has repeatedly called it a hate group.
