It was that it was so easy,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, John Podesta&rsquo;s password into his system -- do you know what his password was? <em>Password</em>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Priebus didn&rsquo;t offer any evidence to host John Dickerson and we didn&rsquo;t hear back from Trump&rsquo;s transition team or the Republican National Committee on our requests for information to back Priebus&rsquo; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any evidence to support what he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The hacking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html?_r=0\">reported</a> on what happened to Podesta:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian hackers sent a &quot;phishing&quot; email -- which aims to get the recipient to click on a deceptive link that gives hackers access to their information -- to Podesta&rsquo;s personal Google mail account in March 2016. The email said Podesta needed to change his password immediately in order to protect his account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Podesta correctly perceived that the email might be a hoax and sought advice from other campaign staffers. In a&nbsp;response, one campaign staffer meant to tell Podesta that the email was illegitimate, but wrote legitimate --&nbsp;prompting Podesta to change his password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With another click,&quot; as the Times put it, &quot;a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account &mdash; a total of about 60,000 &mdash; were unlocked for the Russian hackers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trove amounted to what The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/06/wikileaks-emails-hillary-clinton-campaign-john-podesta\">called</a> &quot;an unprecedented window into a presidential run.&quot; Trump used the emails as fodder for attacks on Clinton -- a number of which PolitiFact National <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/oct/17/10-misleading-trump-attack-lines-wikileaks-email-d/\">found</a> to need context or misinterpreted what the emails actually showed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Podesta would later say that WikiLeaks began publishing his emails about an hour after the October 2016 release of an &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape that showed Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview. His claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/\">was rated True</a> by PolitiFact National.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now back to Priebus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Previous claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days before the Priebus interview, our partners at PunditFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/06/jesse-watters/claim-john-podestas-email-password-was-password-la/\">rated as False</a> a claim by <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/jesse-watters/\">Jesse Watters</a>. He has a &quot;Watters World&quot; a segment that appears on Fox News Channel&rsquo;s &quot;The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor,&quot; which is hosted by conservative talk show host <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bill-oreilly/\">Bill O&rsquo;Reilly</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watters&rsquo; claim was essentially the same as Priebus&#39;. He said Podesta&rsquo;s email password was <em>password</em>, a claim that originated with WikiLeaks&rsquo; Julian Assange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our colleagues found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&rarr; None of the emails published on WikiLeaks show Podesta&rsquo;s email password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&rarr; Among the cyber analysts examining the phishing emails used to infiltrate Podesta&rsquo;s and others&rsquo; accounts, none have made similar claims.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&rarr; Podesta was using a Gmail account, and Google doesn&rsquo;t allow users to make their passwords <em>password</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repeating a claim that originated with WikiLeaks&rsquo; Julian Assange, Priebus said the email password of Podesta, Clinton&rsquo;s presidential campaign chairman, was <em>password</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His claim is catchy, but we&rsquo;ve seen no material evidence to back it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating is False.</p> <div id=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"d81eb15c-dc41-4287-8f18-994075f29f00\" style=\"width: 100%;
