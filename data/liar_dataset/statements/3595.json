Rick Scott appeared on Fox News Channel&#39;s popular <em>Fox and Friends</em> morning show on April 15, 2011, to make the case that it&#39;s possible for Washington to solve its debt crisis without raising taxes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLook at Florida, he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4646350/can-you-cut-the-deficit-without-raising-taxes/\">Speaking via satellite, Scott noted that he has proposed</a> a balanced budget for Florida (as he&#39;s obligated to do by the state Constitution) that cuts spending and reduces taxes. He left out, we should note, that the key parts of his budget proposal -- a cut to the corporate tax rate and cuts to school property taxes -- are currently not part of the plans being considered by either the House or Senate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegardless, Scott told <em>Fox and Friends</em> co-host Brian Kilmeade that President Barack Obama needs to extend the Bush-era tax cuts. If the tax cuts expire, businesses will move elsewhere, where the tax climate is more friendly, Scott said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe message worked on Kilmeade -- who at the end of a four-minute interview said Scott&#39;s message and proposals are resonating with Florida voters. His proof? Scott&#39;s approval ratings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The states that have to balance the budget are making the tough decisions, and getting appreciation for it. Your approval ratings are up,&quot; said Kilmeade, who went on to say that approval numbers are also up for governors in similar positions -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat from New York, and Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican from New Jersey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe don&#39;t know much about Cuomo or Christie, but we know Scott&#39;s positions have been pretty polarizing on some issues. So we were curious if Kilmeade had it right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe found two different polls that have tracked Scott&#39;s approval rating since taken office -- Public Policy Polling, a firm associated with Democratic candidates, and polling from Quinnipiac University, a group generally considered independent. We found an isolated third poll from Viewpoint Florida, a polling firm run by longtime consultants with ties to Florida Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2011/03/scott-incredibly-unpopular.html\">We&#39;ll start with Public Policy Polling.</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nA PPP poll from December, before Scott took office, found that 33 percent of Florida voters liked Scott compared with 43 percent who disliked him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA follow-up poll released March 29, 2011, revealed that Scott&#39;s negative numbers had gotten worse -- not better -- since taking office. In the March poll, 32 percent of voters approved of Scott&#39;s job performance, while 55 percent disapproved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You could say Rick Scott&#39;s honeymoon is over ... but that would suggest he had one in the first place,&quot; Tom Jensen, a Public Policy Polling analyst wrote last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1297.xml?ReleaseID=1583\">Quinnipiac polls</a> also show Scott&#39;s negatives climbing, not falling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe number of Florida voters who disapprove of Scott has more than doubled since February, the polling group found. Scott had a positive 35-22 percent job approval in a poll released Feb. 2. In a follow-up poll April 6, 35 percent approved of Scott&#39;s performance, but 48 disapproved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Today, Scott is a four-letter word to many Florida voters, but political popularity can change with time,&quot; said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. &quot;The experience of Scott&#39;s predecessor, Charlie Crist, who had 70 percent approval ratings at this point in his tenure, shows how fickle public opinion can be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third poll, from Viewpoint Florida, paints a <a href=\"http://viewpointflorida.org/index.php/site/article/floridians_divided_on_scott_casinos/\">slightly better picture for Scott</a>. Forty-seven respondents surveyed March 29-30 approved of Scott&#39;s performance, while 48 percent disapproved. Pollster Randy Nielsen said the polling group didn&#39;t have previous approval numbers to compare it to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott <a href=\"http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/florida-honeymoon-with-governor-rick-scott-is-over-\">acknowledged his poor poll numbers in an Associated Press article</a> on April 6. &quot;I didn&#39;t run to be the most popular governor. I ran to make sure this state is most likely to succeed,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKilmeade, on <em>Fox and Friends</em>, said Scott&#39;s approval numbers are going up. Not according to the publicly available poll numbers we found. We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Updated to include Viewpoint Florida poll result.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-15T11:51:28.104838", "ruling_date": "2011-04-15T17:05:20", "ruling_headline": "'Fox and Friends' host says Gov.
