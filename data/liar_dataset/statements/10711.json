The board has been <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/bucks-to-unveil-game-changing-1-billion-arena-package-b99477026z1-298990901.html\">suggested as a potential source of bonds </a>to help finance a new Milwaukee Bucks arena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Adamczyk won election in November 2014, he has raised questions about Nelson&rsquo;s performance and her background as an environmentalist. He requested years of her phone and travel records and <a href=\"http://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/meetings_notes.asp?thismeeting=2899\">unsuccessfully tried to get her fired</a> at the March 3, 2015 meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schimel and La Follette voted down a motion by Adamczyk to remove Nelson, daughter of <a href=\"http://www.nelsonearthday.net/\">Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tia Nelson&rsquo;s performance came up again at the <a href=\"http://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/meetings_doc.asp?thismeeting=2901\">April 7, 2015 board meeting,</a> and not long after the meeting NextGen Climate, a group that says its aim is to bring &quot;climate change to the forefront of American politics,&quot; <a href=\"https://nextgenclimate.org/climatechange/wisconsin-republicans-seek-florida-style-moratorium-on-climate-change/\">posted an item on its blog</a> saying Nelson had been muzzled by the public lands board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group said Nelson had been banned from &quot;engaging in global warming or climate change&quot; work on state time and compared the action to a move in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/10/floridas-ban-of-the-term-climate-change-is-straight-out-of-the-bush-playbook/\">Florida to block state workers from using the term &quot;climate change.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the board really order Nelson -- and other agency employees -- not to talk about climate change on state time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007-&rsquo;08, Nelson was tapped by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, to co-chair a state global warming task force. During that time she also held her position at the public lands agency. Not long after the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/state/state-examples/action-plans.html#wi\">global warming report</a> was issued, Nelson traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify about climate change at a congressional hearing and discussed the report in other settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adamczyk has called her task force work <a href=\"http://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/meetings_notes.asp?thismeeting=2899\">theft of the state&rsquo;s time</a> and also <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/new-wisconsin-treasurer-makes-waves-in-role-on-obscure-state-board-b99429552z1-289233071.html\">criticized Nelson and La Follette for recently attending a land commissioners&rsquo; conference</a> in Phoenix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the April 7 meeting, Nelson defended herself and said she served on the task force at the request of Doyle. She said she hasn&#39;t actively worked on global warming since the task force disbanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have never lobbied on climate change on state time in the entire 10 years I&#39;ve been at the board of commissioners,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After her comments, Adamczyk asked for approval of a resolution to &quot;prohibit staff from engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time.&quot; Adamczyk and Schimel voted in favor, La Follette voted no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Nelson and she declined to discuss the board&rsquo;s action -- or climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She did note she was going to be on vacation April 22, which is Earth Day, giving a talk about her father at his alma mater, San Jose State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advocacy group NextGen Climate says Nelson, daughter of the founder of Earth Day, is under orders not to discuss global warming on state time. That&rsquo;s indeed the wording of the resolution approved 2-1 by the agency&rsquo;s board. We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-10T15:06:24.085582", "ruling_date": "2015-04-10T15:05:15", "ruling_headline": "Group says daughter of Earth Day founder was ordered not to do climate change work on the job", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-says-wisconsin-ordered-daughter-earth-day-fo", "ruling_link_text": "That's what the 2-1 vote was about", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/state/state-examples/action-plans.html#wi\">Wisconsin Global Warming Task Force report, 2008</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Board of Commissioners of Public Lands <a href=\"http://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/meetings_doc.asp?thismeeting=2901\">agenda, April 7, 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/meetings_doc.asp?thismeeting=2901\">&quot;State board bans workers from discussing global warming,&quot; </a>April 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/bucks-to-unveil-game-changing-1-billion-arena-package-b99477026z1-298990901.html\">&quot;Bucks announce game-changing $1 billion arena package,&quot;</a> April 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/07/wisconsin-republicans-climate-change\">&quot;Republicans try to prevent Wisconsin official from working on climate change,&quot; </a>April 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Capital Times, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/board-of-commissioners-of-public-lands-bans-staff-from-climate/article_1c433c90-2d10-5dfa-8b3e-955e201a3457.html\">&quot;Board of Commissioners of Public Lands bans staff from climate change work&quot; </a>April 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NexGen Climate, <a href=\"https://nextgenclimate.org/climatechange/wisconsin-republicans-seek-florida-style-moratorium-on-climate-change/\">&quot;Wisconsin Republicans seek Florida-style moratorium on climate change,&quot;</a> April 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Center for Investigative Reporting, <a href=\"http://fcir.org/2015/03/08/in-florida-officials-ban-term-climate-change/\">&quot;In Florida, officials ban term &lsquo;climate change,&rsquo;&quot; </a>March 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nelsonearthday.net/\">Gaylord Nelson and Earth Day</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://bcpl.state.wi.us/\">State of Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://bcpl.wisconsin.gov/meetings_past.asp?meetingid=179&amp;locid=145\">State of Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands meeting minutes</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2480, "last_name": "Next Generation Climate Action Committee", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "next-generation-climate-action-committee", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/generic_group_photo_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2480/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.vaclimatevoters.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s attorney general and state treasurer ordered the daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson not to discuss climate change on state time.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2015-04-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Most scientists agree that climate change is real and humans are causing it.
