And it&#39;s not fair to them because what&#39;s going to happen to them when they leave our high schools and they go to the community college where 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial courses to get the exact same math that we&#39;re talking about?&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tSeventy to seventy-five percent of Rhode Island high school graduates who go to community college have to take remedial courses in math? That struck us as a huge percentage, even for&nbsp;those graduates who wanted a higher education but might not have had the grades, test scores or money to get into a four-year school. So we decided to check the numbers.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tFirst stop: Gist&#39;s office, where spokesman Elliot Krieger told us that the data came from the Rhode Island Office of Higher Education.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWhen we contacted that office, spokesman Michael Trainor sent us to the Community College of Rhode Island, where William LeBlanc, the school&#39;s director of institutional research and planning, gave us the data for students enrolled last fall who had graduated from high school -- 97 percent of them from Rhode Island -- within the previous year.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tCCRI uses a placement test called <a href=\"https://www.accuplacer.org/cat/\">Accuplacer</a>, developed by the same group responsible for the Scholastic Assessment Test for college-bound high school students, to identify students who need remedial work.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAmong those 2,250 recent high school graduates, just over 75 percent needed some type of remedial course, whether it was math, English or writing, LeBlanc said. &quot;That&#39;s the highest we&#39;ve had in awhile.&quot; The rate usually ranges from 70-75 percent. He said that&#39;s not unusual for a community college.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThe biggest need was usually for remedial math -- 65.7 didn&#39;t pass the math requirement. They had to take Fundamentals of Math -- which deals with basic arithmetic, percentages and working with fractions -- or high school algebra.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tIn addition, 47 percent had to take remedial reading and 36 percent of the recent high school graduates were required to take remedial writing, LeBlanc said.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tEducation Commissioner Deborah Gist said, &quot;When [students] leave our high schools and they go to the community college . . . 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial [math] courses.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThe actual rate this past fall at CCRI was 65.7 percent.
