Would it really be Sanders accepting the nomination this week at the DNC if not for superdelegates?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Superdelegates, if you&rsquo;ll remember from our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/mar/29/5-questions-you-have-about-delegates-answered/\">primer</a>, are the party officials and bigshots who make up about one-sixth of the delegates in the Democratic Party&rsquo;s system. Under the rules that governed this year&rsquo;s primaries, the superdelegates weren&rsquo;t bound to the voting results in their state and could vote for whomever they wish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many superdelegates <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-28/clinton-camp-saying-it-already-secured-one-fifth-the-delegates-needed-for-nomination\">backed</a> Clinton before voting even began, and she commanded a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-sanders-democrats-20160516-snap-story.html\">disproportionate</a> lead in superdelegates throughout the primaries, eliciting many cries of unfairness and cronyism from voters and Sanders supporters. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump is wrong. Sanders would not have won the primary without these party insiders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign didn&rsquo;t get back to us, but the &quot;analysis&quot; he may have been referring to could be a <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/07/sanders-won-number-super-delegates-hillary-sanders-won-nomination/\">blog post</a> on Gateway Pundit, a conservative newsblog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post&rsquo;s headline is &quot;NOTE TO SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Bernie Would Have Won If Not for Super Delegate System!&quot; It makes a flawed argument that Sanders would have nabbed the nomination if all of the Clinton superdelegates backed him instead. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That math checks out on paper, but it is nonsensical in reality. &nbsp;The post offers no rationale for why the superdelegates should flip their votes against the popular vote (Clinton won <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/democratic_vote_count.html\">3.8 million more</a> than Sanders). Experts <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/mar/22/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-superdelegates-never/\">told</a> PolitiFact Florida that superdelegates could have played a difference if the race was closer. And to top it off, Sanders himself repeatedly <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/273691-sanders-the-concept-of-super-delegates-is-problematic\">advocated</a> for superdelegates to follow the will of their state&rsquo;s voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other scenarios, such as binding superdelegates to their state&rsquo;s vote proportionally or taking them out of the system all together, Sanders would have still been unable to reach the magical 2,383-threshold of delegates needed to capture the nomination and would still trail Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zoZfUA5Om0J431rYe-u6QNRLo0s6Syo5pTQHMIuvsMI/edit?usp=sharing\">breakdown</a> of how many superdelegates Clinton and Sanders would have received under different primary systems, based on Green Papers&rsquo; superdelegate count.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Clinton</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Total (superdelegates)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Sanders</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Total (superdelegates)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Without superdelegates (Trump suggestion)</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,200</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1,831</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>With unbound superdelegates (current system)</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,771 (571)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1,875 (44)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>With winner-take-all superdelegates</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,721 (521)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,019 (188)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>With proportional allocation of superdelegates</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,590 (390)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,150 (319)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>(A note about our delegate methodology: Delegate counts vary from publication to publication, so we used Real Clear Politics and Green Papers, sources listed by the Gateway Pundit blog post.
