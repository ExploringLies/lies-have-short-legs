Doug Ducey talked fire safety at a press conference April 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it&rsquo;s important to note that 90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused,&quot; Ducey said. &quot;Unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, hot exhaust pipes, any source of extreme heat or spark can result in a Wallow or Rodeo-Chediski fire.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given Arizona&rsquo;s vast land area, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/map/LND110210/04\">113,594.08 square miles</a> to be exact, we were curious as to whether nine out of every 10 fires in the state really are caused by humans and how that could be documented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sort of </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ducey&rsquo;s spokesman, Daniel Scarpinato, provided us with Arizona State Forestry data that backs up the governor&rsquo;s claim on the surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, 352 out of 404 fires, more than 87 percent, were human-caused. Of the 304 fires reported this year, 296, more than 97 percent, were human-caused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The State Forestry maintains a database of all fires, even if they don&rsquo;t respond to a blaze at first. State Forestry spokesman Bill Boyd said most fires historically are human-caused, even something as simple as parking a hot car over grass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you look at it over the years, there is a large human component in there,&quot; Boyd said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a caveat here -- the data only includes fires on state and private land, not federal land. Ducey said &quot;in Arizona,&quot; which also includes federally-managed land. <a href=\"http://time.com/4167983/federal-government-land-oregon/\">Almost 40 percent</a> of the Grand Canyon State is federal land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple agencies, including the U.S. Agriculture Department, U.S. Defense Department and U.S. Interior Department, have fire jurisdiction over certain areas of land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the U.S. Forest Service has fire jurisdiction over national forests and the Bureau of Indian Affairs does the same for tribal land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is complex and coordinated at all levels, from local to national,&quot; said Mary Zabinski, spokeswoman for the Southwest Coordination Center, an interagency group of state and federal agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that coordination means we do have a total for the entire state for human-caused fires. According to the Southwest Coordination Center, for the entire state of Arizona -- state, private and federal land --&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gacc.nifc.gov/swcc/predictive/intelligence/ytd_historical/historical/fire_data/fires_and_acres_endofyearreporting/other/All_Fires_Average_Per_Year.pdf\">61 percent of fires in 2015 were caused by humans</a>, and 39 percent of fires were caused by lightning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Jennifer Jones notes that 90 percent of wildfires on all land nationwide are caused by humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Typically, the majority of fires on land under the jurisdiction of state and local government agencies are human caused as those lands are closer to homes and roads,&quot; Jones said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ducey said that &quot;90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused.&quot; Ducey&rsquo;s claim is correct when referencing only state and private land. But he wasn&rsquo;t that specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fires &quot;in Arizona&quot; includes federally-managed land, in addition to state and private land. And the percentage of human-caused fires on all those lands combined isn&rsquo;t 90 percent, it&rsquo;s 61 percent. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Ducey has a point that human activity is contributing to wildfires, but the number he cites is a good bit off. On balance, we rate Ducey&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525a6335-26e4-476f-8213-ceac74e77b7c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525a6335-26e4-476f-8213-ceac74e77b7c</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-18T17:55:43.989841", "ruling_date": "2016-04-19T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Are 90 percent of fires in Arizona caused by humans?
