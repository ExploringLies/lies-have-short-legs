We could have 600 million people pour into our country. Think of it. Once you have open borders like that, you don&rsquo;t have a country anymore,&quot; Trump said in Greeley, Colo., on Oct. 30, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-could-let-650-million-new-immigrants-into-u-s/\">according to CBS News</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time Trump spoke in&nbsp;Albuquerque, the number had jumped to 650 million people. And Trump said it would happen &quot;in one week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That&rsquo;s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week,&quot;&nbsp;Trump <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-could-let-650-million-new-immigrants-into-u-s/\">said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both claims are ridiculous and should be discarded immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some numbers, for context</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worldwide population is about 7.3 billion people, and the United States is home to about <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\">324 million</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. immigrant population in 2014 was more than <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states\">42.4 million</a>, or 13.3 percent of the nation&rsquo;s total population, according to Migration Policy Institute estimates using Census Bureau data. That represents millions of people who have migrated to the United States over decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/14/donald-trump/trump-says-1-million-legal-crossings-along-us-mexi/\">1 million daily legal crossings</a> between the United States and Mexico -- that&rsquo;s a count of people going back and forth into each country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexicans represent the single largest share of the U.S. total migrant population, about <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/largest-immigrant-groups-over-time\">27</a> percent in 2015, according to Migration Policy Institute. Yet, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-net-migration-mexico-was-0-2014/\">more Mexicans have left</a> the United States than have come in since the end of the Great Recession, <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/\">according to Pew Research Center</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get close to Trump&#39;s 650 million migration, every single person from South America, Central America and Canada would have to move to the United States (about 633 million people), the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/31/donald-trump-warns-that-650-million-immigrants-could-come-to-the-u-s-in-a-week-lets-do-the-math/\"><em>Washington Post</em> noted</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do it, as Trump said, in one week, 3.87 million people would have to enter the country every hour for 168 straight hours. That&#39;s equivalent to the entire population of the city of Los Angeles entering the country every hour for a full week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clinton&rsquo;s immigration stance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump&#39;s claim is logistically impossible, it&#39;s also in no way what Clinton proposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Trump&rsquo;s campaign where the candidate was drawing his information from and they circled back to their claim that Clinton is for open borders, something we&#39;ve rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-create-tot/\">False</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/trump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-/\">Mostly False</a> depending on the particulars of what Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton campaign said she did not support allowing 650 million people into the country. &quot;This is just demonstrably false,&quot; said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is Clinton&rsquo;s policy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At campaign events, presidential debates, press conferences and on the immigration reform page on Clinton&rsquo;s campaign website, there has been no mention of Clinton wanting millions of people to pour into the United States, much less in a week. She has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jul/18/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-open-bo/\">not</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-create-tot/\">called for</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/trump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-/\">open borders</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2015, Clinton said in a CBS&rsquo; <em>Face the Nation </em>interview the United States should accept 65,000 Syrian refugees afflicted by that country&rsquo;s civil war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more,&quot; Clinton <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-u-s-should-take-65000-syrian-refugees/\">said</a>.&nbsp;She has stressed a need for <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/radicalization-and-extremism/hillary-clinton-national-security-islamic-state/p37266\">thorough refugee</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/sep/29/rick-scott/clinton-wants-admit-thousands-refugees-no-vetting-/\">vetting</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on Clinton&rsquo;s September 2015 comment, Trump recently made the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/trump-says-clinton-would-bring-620000-refugees-her/\">False</a> assertion that Clinton would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has not said that, and Trump&rsquo;s statement was based on assumptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton does support increasing immigration for high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs. But there&#39;s been no reference to millions of people migrating to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the Democratic presidential nominee has widely spoken about offering a <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/immigration-reform/\">path to citizenship</a> for immigrants in the country illegally and to introduce comprehensive immigration reform within her first 100 days in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has said she would focus on deporting<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/immigration-reform/\"> </a>those who pose a violent threat to public safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/trump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-/\">In 2013</a>, Clinton supported legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-said-marco-rubio-open-border/\">billions for border </a>security, fencing along the Mexican border and adding 20,000 border agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Clinton &quot;wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That&rsquo;s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has never said that, nor is this a realistic possibility. Clinton&nbsp;has spoken in favor of bring in 65,000 Syrian refugees, but that&rsquo;s nowhere near hundreds of millions of people, and not in a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s claim is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
