The professors were expressing &quot;their collective groan&quot; about budgeting and &quot;job-for-life tenure.&quot; The school &quot;should not be about protecting the interests of the faculty, but about delivering value and excellence to Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a Walker news release, pretty vitriolic stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in another way, the release was more typical, as it was filled with bullets of factual claims -- including this one, about the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At 2.8 students per faculty,&quot; the release declared, &quot;average student enrollment per instructor is currently tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fewer than three students for every faculty member?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would be a swing and a miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No-confidence votes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UW-Milwaukee&rsquo;s total enrollment of <a href=\"https://pollux.uwsa.edu/PRODUCTION/ssbreports/index.php/HeadCountReports/getSingleYearReportByInstitution/single/pdf/R_B100_tot/201516/0\">27,000</a> (<a href=\"https://pollux.uwsa.edu/PRODUCTION/ssbreports/index.php/HeadCountReports/getSingleYearReportByInstitution/single/pdf/R_B300_tot/201516/0\">22,000</a> undergraduates) makes it the second-largest school, behind UW-Madison (<a href=\"https://pollux.uwsa.edu/PRODUCTION/ssbreports/index.php/HeadCountReports/getSingleYearReportByInstitution/single/pdf/R_B100_tot/201516/0\">43,000</a> and <a href=\"https://pollux.uwsa.edu/PRODUCTION/ssbreports/index.php/HeadCountReports/getSingleYearReportByInstitution/single/pdf/R_B300_tot/201516/0\">31,000</a>), in the University of Wisconsin System. The system is overseen by members of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wisconsin.edu/regents/\">Board of Regents</a>, nearly all of whom&nbsp;are appointed by the governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Walker took office in 2011, the system campuses have received budget cuts and professors have seen tenure protections partially weakened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are key reasons for a <a href=\"http://fox11online.com/news/local/green-bay/uwgb-faculty-vote-no-confidence-in-cross-uw-regents\">series</a> of no-confidence votes directed at the UW System, beginning with one approved by UW-Madison faculty eight days before the UW-Milwaukee vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s pre-emptive statement was issued <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/as-uwm-faculty-gather-for-no-confidence-vote-scott-walker-pushes-back-b99722821z1-378853261.html\">less than two hours</a> before nearly 300 Milwaukee faculty members unanimously passed their no-confidence vote. That represented roughly 40 percent of the full-time faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker&rsquo;s figure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back the 2.8 ratio claim, Walker&rsquo;s office cited a <a href=\"https://www.wisconsin.edu/accountability/faculty-and-staff/\">UW System chart</a> on &quot;average individual instruction.&quot; The latest figure, for fall 2013, shows a ratio of 2.8 for UW-Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that is not a ratio of the total students per faculty member, as Walker says in the news release. It is a much narrower measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the chart itself explains, that is the ratio is for &quot;individualized instruction, such as independent study or thesis research.&quot; Indeed, you would expect a ratio of 2.8 students per faculty member for such one-on-one-style instruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Milwaukee&rsquo;s overall ratio is much different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The actual ratio</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www4.uwm.edu/discover/leadership.cfm\">Robin Van Harpen</a>, UW-Milwaukee&rsquo;s vice chancellor for finance and administrative affairs, gave us figures for fall 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using full-time-equivalents, the school had 22,491 total&nbsp;students and 779 faculty (faculty being full, associate and assistant professors).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a student-to-faculty ratio of 29 to 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, in 1994, the year Walker referenced in his news release, the ratio was actually lower: 21 to 1. And it has steadily trended upward since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is growing, not shrinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two final points:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Lecturers and adjunct instructors, who also teach, are not considered faculty. But if you include them in the count, the current ratio is 19 to 1 -- still far above what Walker claimed.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The day after the Milwaukee vote, Walker&rsquo;s office essentially corrected itself in a statement on a no-confidence vote at UW-Green Bay. The statement cited the same 2.8 statistic as it applied to Green Bay -- but <a href=\"http://fox11online.com/news/local/green-bay/uwgb-faculty-vote-no-confidence-in-cross-uw-regents\">added a line</a> to make clear that the ratio referred only to individualized instruction.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charging that the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is shrinking, Walker said the school has &quot;2.8 students per faculty&quot; member, &quot;tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Walker cited the wrong statistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, UW-Milwaukee has 29 students for every professor, associate professor and assistant professor -- and that ratio has been growing, not shrinking, since 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b0f3e97-bf70-4e81-9fcb-0e2efdd28a55\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b0f3e97-bf70-4e81-9fcb-0e2efdd28a55</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-13T13:17:38.288812", "ruling_date": "2016-05-13T12:16:40", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker way off in saying University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has 2.8 students per faculty member", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-way-saying-university-wisconsin-milwa", "ruling_link_text": "Wrong stat cited; ratio actually 29:1", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gov.
