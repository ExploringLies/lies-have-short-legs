Ron Klein -- made a rather striking claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWest was responding to a question about tax liens that had allegedly been placed against him -- an issue that had already inspired a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4ZanZLBpg0&amp;feature=player_embedded\" id=\"r7nw\" title=\"hard-hitting ad\">hard-hitting ad</a> by Klein.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">According to a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXl2GwCHlAI\" id=\"y73h\" title=\"video\">video</a> made by a Democratic Party operative who trails West at all of his appearances, the candidate told the audience, <font size=\"2\">&quot;I had a Top Secret/Security Compartmented Information classification, that is the highest you can have in the United States Army. You don&rsquo;t get a security classification like that if you have financial issues like that. I still retain a Secret security clearance. And I tell you, if you look at the application for a security clearance, I have a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain because of my background.&quot;</font></font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">We&#39;ve already addressed questions about the lien (we rated Klein&#39;s ad <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/aug/30/ron-klein/ron-klien-says-allen-west-late-paying-bills/\" id=\"yj5_\" title=\"Mostly True\">Mostly True</a>). But we wondered whether it was really possible for someone -- anyone -- to have a higher security clearance than the president. So we asked a few experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, some background on security clearances. There are three levels, in ascending order: Confidential, Secret and Top Secret. There are many subcategories, but the only one that is relevant here is an elite category of Top Secret called Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented information, or TS/SCI. It is for people who have Top Secret clearances but who may, in order to do their jobs, need to know certain information that is especially sensitive, such as sources and methods of intelligence-gathering. A TS/SCI clearance allows them to know the information they need, but it is not a blanket clearance for all extremely sensitive information. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called &quot;compartmented.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWest mentioned TS/SCI in his comments at the Pompano Civic Association, though he got the name slightly wrong, calling it &quot;<font size=\"2\">Top Secret/<i>Security </i>Compartmented Information</font>.&quot; To be picky, West would have had a TS/SCI <i>clearance</i>, rather than &quot;classification&quot; -- people have clearances, documents have classifications.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe inquired with the Pentagon about his clearance but weren&#39;t able to get an answer Friday night. E<font size=\"2\">xperts we spoke to said that it was plausible for someone like West to have a TS/SCI clearance</font>, so for the purposes of this fact-check, we&#39;ll assume he had that level. As you&#39;ll see below, his actual level wouldn&#39;t change our conclusion.</font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">Our experts also said that it&#39;s plausible that West would still have a Secret clearance today. Since retired officers can be called back to duty, and because many of them do consulting work for the military or for companies that work with the military, it&#39;s common for retired officers to maintain a security clearance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what about him having &quot;<font size=\"2\">a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe see at least two ways to look at this claim.</font></font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font size=\"2\"><font size=\"2\">The first is that West is saying that he had a higher security clearance than someone occupying the office of president of the United States. Even if you assume that he was referring to the period in which West held a TS/SCI, our experts say he&#39;s wrong.</font></font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">&quot;The president is the one who established the security clearance system <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/clinton/eo12968.html\" id=\"zax4\" title=\"by executive order\">by executive order</a>,&quot; said <font size=\"2\">Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists</font>.</font><font size=\"2\"> </font>&quot;Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJohn Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. &quot;This is a silly statement,&quot; Pike said. &quot;The only clearance the president needs is the mandate of the people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement is even more questionable if West was actually referring to what he says is his current clearance -- Secret.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A Secret security clearance is the most commonly held security clearance,&quot; Aftergood said. &quot;Almost anyone without a criminal record or serious financial difficulties can get such a clearance if their employment requires it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">There&#39;s one more possible interpretation, and when we reached the West campaign, they said this is indeed what the candidate meant at the forum. As <font size=\"2\">a career military officer, West went through a rigorous screening and investigatory process in order to receive his TS/SCI clearance. President Barack Obama got his authority by virtue of a popular vote. There is no security process required before one becomes president.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">If, in theory, Obama was not president and decided to apply for a security clearance, there&#39;s no guarantee he&#39;d qualify for one. He&#39;d have to go through a painstaking process, and investigators may raise any number of questions.</font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The fact that (Obama) admitted to cocaine use, travel to unauthorized countries years before, and his associations with (black nationalist) Louis Farrakhan and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, he probably would not have been granted a security clearance,&quot; said Josh Grodin, West&#39;s campaign manager.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis argument does at least have a grain of validity to it. But we see some problems with it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">During the presidential campaign, a similar claim was floated by some Obama opponents. One chain e-mail alleged that &quot;if Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist.&quot; We ruled it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/17/chain-email/the-truth-fades-into-the-background/\" id=\"i08v\" title=\"False\">False</a>.</font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPike said that the one thing in Obama&#39;s background that could raise a flag for someone doing a security check is &quot;his <font size=\"2\">unaccompanied foreign travel for an extended period of time.&quot; Still, he added, &quot;the tender age at which Obama traveled abroad would almost certainly render this irrelevant, particularly in light of everything else he has done.</font>&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo the extent that West has already been cleared by national-security vetters, and Obama has not, we think West may have a small point. Still, even using this logic, West oversteps when he says that his own clearance is one &quot;<font size=\"2\">that even the president of the United States cannot obtain</font>.&quot; We don&#39;t believe the evidence suggests that it&#39;s an open-and-shut case that Obama would be denied the kind of security clearance West had.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that&#39;s the <i>most </i>plausible interpretation of West&#39;s comment. The other interpretation -- that West&#39;s clearance, either today or in the past -- was higher than any president&#39;s is ridiculously false. The president has the highest security clearance in the land. We rate West&#39;s claim Pants on Fire.</font></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-24T17:40:48.146954", "ruling_date": "2010-09-24T18:28:50", "ruling_headline": "Allen West says he has \"clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "allen-west-says-he-has-clearance-even-president-un", "ruling_link_text": "No way he outranks the commander in chief", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAllen West, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXl2GwCHlAI\" id=\"or3b\" title=\"comments\">comments</a> at Pompano Civic Association candidate forum, Sept. 21, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhite House, <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/clinton/eo12968.html\" id=\"zugf\" title=\"executive order 12968\">executive order 12968</a> (signed by President Bill Clinton), Aug. 4, 1995</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/aug/30/ron-klein/ron-klien-says-allen-west-late-paying-bills/\" id=\"zxp8\" title=\"Ron Klein says Allen West late on paying bills\">Ron Klein says Allen West late on paying bills</a>,&quot; Aug. 30, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/17/chain-email/the-truth-fades-into-the-background/\" id=\"xixh\" title=\"The truth fades into the background\">The truth fades into the background</a>,&quot; Oct. 17, 2008</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, Sept. 24, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, Sept. 24, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Mark F.
