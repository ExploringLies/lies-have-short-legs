Gov. David Dewhurst to the mythical chupacabra, saying his opponent -- the Republican frontrunner for the seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after 2012 -- isn&rsquo;t engaging with his opponents. Specifically, the narrator says: &quot;Since he entered the race on July 21, Dewhurst has skipped nine candidate forums.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNine skips in nine forums?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCruz&rsquo;s campaign passed us a list of nine Senate candidate forums that took place from July 21 through Sept. 15, 2011, with contact information for each event&rsquo;s organizer. And in telephone interviews, forum organizers confirmed to us that Dewhurst did not appear at the gatherings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Cruz campaign did not list an Aug. 28 event near Sugar Land, organized on behalf of U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, R-Houston; both the Dewhurst and Olson campaigns confirmed that the lieutenant governor and other GOP Senate candidates attended and were given five minutes each to speak.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThus, out of 10 forums between July 21 and Sept. 15, Dewhurst did not appear at nine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is not showing up the same as skipping? We wondered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe organizers of seven forums told us Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign told them beforehand that Dewhurst would not participate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExceptions: Marc Moffitt of the Denton County Republican Party said Dewhurst&rsquo;s camp said he couldn&rsquo;t come until after he declared his candidacy and then he announced his candidacy the same July night as the party&rsquo;s forum, meaning he wasn&rsquo;t even a candidate until then. And Toby Walker of the Waco Tea Party said she never heard from Dewhurst&rsquo;s camp about her invitations to its Aug. 13, 2011, event. Walker said: &quot;It&rsquo;s almost worse never to get a response. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not worthy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong other forum organizers, Dean Wright, who steered the July 30, 2011, Austin Tea Party forum, said the group set out a chair for Dewhurst in case he changed his mind. Robert &quot;Gonzo&quot; Gonzalez, overseeing an August forum for the Clear Lake Tea Party, said Dewhurst&rsquo;s camp told him it was &quot;early in the campaign (to attend); I accepted that.&quot; Capy Alexander of the Republican Women of Kerr County said Dewhurst&rsquo;s camp sounded interested in its Aug. 19, 2011, event, but &quot;as it turns out, he was unable to come. I don&rsquo;t know why.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost of the nine organizers told us they did not view Dewhurst&rsquo;s non-attendance as &quot;skipping.&quot; Maria Acosta of the Central Texas 9-12 Project said she would better describe its Aug. 20, 2011, gathering as a &quot;lost opportunity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, Katrina Pierson of the Garland Tea Party said that even though Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign said before its Sept. 15, 2011, event that Dewhurst had a prior commitment, she still views him as skipping out because the group initially told him about its plans in May.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Dewhurst campaign responded by stating that Dewhurst was acting governor on six of the nine event dates listed by Cruz and had a previously scheduled Republican event on another.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst himself, after he held an Austin town hall event Oct. 3, told us, &quot;There is a whole other dynamic that folks are forgetting. Every week now for six weeks in a row, and maybe for another 13, 14 or 15 months, I&rsquo;m the acting governor. ... I&rsquo;m having a hard enough time just to go out and do some of our campaign events when we have both paperwork, responsibilities -- when we had the Bastrop (wild)fire, I was over there almost the whole week, totally consumed by it. So state business for me comes first.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the candidate forums, Dewhurst said: &quot;Quite frankly, I&rsquo;m interested in getting our message out to the people, not necessarily spending a disproportional amount of time (with) the candidates talking to each other. &hellip; What I think is in the voters&rsquo; best interest is to hear from the candidates, and so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;re going to almost a different city every day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking forward, he said, that &quot;as we can, we&rsquo;re going to go to a forum or so every month.&quot; This month, he said, he plans to appear at <a href=\"http://www.spiritoffreedomwomen.com/texas-gop-us-senate-candidate-forum/\">an Oct. 21 candidate forum</a> hosted by the Spirit of Freedom Republican Women PAC in Sugar Land.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur take: Dewhurst did not appear at nine forums, eight of them after the night he announced his candidacy. But it&rsquo;s a mite questionable to say he outright skipped the events. In most cases, his campaign said beforehand Dewhurst wasn&rsquo;t going to appear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Cruz&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-03T17:38:47.607824", "ruling_date": "2011-10-03T16:26:44", "ruling_headline": "Ted Cruz says David Dewhurst ducked nine U.S. Senate forums after declaring his candidacy", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-cruz-says-david-dewhurst-ducked-nine-us-senate", "ruling_link_text": "Mostly RSVP'd no", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTed Cruz campaign video, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di9Attkt7BU\">&quot;Spotted!,&quot;</a> <a href=\"http://www.duckingdewhurst.com/\">Duckingdewhurst.com</a>, Sept. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Lt.
