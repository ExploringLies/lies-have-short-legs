Jerry Brown recently jabbed at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying Golden State is &quot;growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown made this claim in the middle of an impassioned defense of climate change science at the American Geophysical Union conference on Dec. 14, 2016 in San Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve proved in California that the economy grows. And it grows in part because of the climate rules that we&rsquo;ve adopted,&quot; Brown said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perry, a climate change skeptic, was recently selected U.S. energy secretary by President-elect Trump. While Texas governor, he repeatedly visited California in an attempt to lure jobs to the Lone Star State, with the promise of less regulation and lower costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his speech, Brown said Perry&rsquo;s critiques about California&rsquo;s job-killing red tape don&rsquo;t hold up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now remember our new secretary of energy, he was coming to California to say: &lsquo;Come to Texas because we have all the jobs in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, Rick: I got some news for you, California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas, and we have more sun than you have oil!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"439\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAmericanGeophysicalUnion%2Fvideos%2F10153868688001601%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Gov. Jerry Brown makes his claim about California &quot;growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas&quot; at about the 13:00 minute mark in the video above.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Brown&rsquo;s reference of Perry, we took his &quot;faster than Texas&quot; claim to mean faster economic growth with a focus on jobs. We decided to zero-in on job growth rates in California and Texas, while also weighing GDP and unemployment trends in the states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll leave the fun comparison of sunshine to oil for Brown and Perry to wrestle with another day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We concede there&rsquo;s no definition for what &quot;a hell of a lot faster&quot; growth looks like. Still, we&rsquo;ll do our best to sort out the governor&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s spokeswoman pointed us to several news articles detailing California&rsquo;s recent economic improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking solely at 2015 job growth rates, Brown&rsquo;s claim appears to hold up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that year, California added 483,000 jobs, posting a jobs growth rate of 3 percent, based on <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ca.htm\">data</a>&nbsp;we crunched from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That pace was twice as fast as Texas&rsquo; 1.5 percent job growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s rapid employment gains have slowed somewhat to about 2 percent this year through November. That may not qualify as &quot;a hell of a lot faster,&quot; but it&rsquo;s still greater than Texas&rsquo; roughly 1.6 percent job growth rate so far this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The business website Kiplinger.com forecast California would rank <a href=\"http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/business/T019-S010-states-with-the-fastest-job-growth-in-2016/index.html\">10th in the nation</a> among states for fastest job growth in 2016. It noted that Texas was not on its Top 10 list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long ago, however, that Texas outpaced California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, Texas recorded a 3.7 percent job growth rate, ahead of California&rsquo;s 2.9 percent pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking to the future, California&rsquo;s job gains may slow. The closely watched <a href=\"http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/media-relations/2016/ucla-anderson-forecast-slowly-steady-growth-continues\">UCLA Anderson Forecast</a> predicts jobs to grow by only 1.5 percent in the state during 2017 and just 0.8 percent in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Brown used the phrase &quot;is growing,&quot; we&rsquo;ll judge him on the most recent figures, not future forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Overall economy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the pace of job growth is important, it&rsquo;s not the only measurement of a state&rsquo;s economic health. And Brown&rsquo;s claim could be interpreted as California&rsquo;s overall economy, not just jobs, is growing much faster than the economy in Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August, PolitiFact Texas took a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/aug/17/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-california-besting-texas-creati/\">deep look</a> at the economies of both California and Texas to evaluate a June claim by Juli&aacute;n Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that &quot;Today, California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It rated the claim True, citing greater jobs, per capita income and GDP growth rates in California. It noted Texas had a lower jobless rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building on that fact check, we looked at the most recent economic figures for both states to see if the assessment still holds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that California&rsquo;s GDP grew faster than Texas&rsquo; in the first two quarters of this year, at rates of 2 percent and most recently 2.2 percent compared with Texas&rsquo; 1.3 percent and its most recent quarter, a negative 0.8 percent, according to <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_state/2016/qgsp1216.htm\">a news release in&nbsp;December</a> by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a different story in 2015 when Texas&rsquo; GDP expanded by 4.8 percent (a figure that was recently revised upward) compared with California&rsquo;s 3.8 percent GDP expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">unemployment rates</a>, Texas, at 4.6 percent in November, has consistently fared better than California, where the rate was 5.3 percent in November, and has hovered well above 5 percent this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California had one more economic bright spot in 2015: Per capita personal income grew at twice the rate as in Texas, <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/regional/bearfacts/pdf.cfm?fips=06000&amp;areatype=STATE&amp;geotype=3\">5.4 percent</a> to<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/regional/bearfacts/pdf.cfm?fips=48000&amp;areatype=STATE&amp;geotype=3\"> 2.6 percent</a>, according to federal data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed &quot;California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took this to mean economic growth with a focus on the pace of job creation. California&rsquo;s 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas&rsquo; pace, definitely fits into Brown&#39;s colorful claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But California&rsquo;s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas&rsquo; 1.6 job growth rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California&rsquo;s GDP expanded faster than Texas&rsquo; GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, like the state&rsquo;s economy in recent years, is on the right track. And while California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily &quot;a hell of a lot faster.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Brown&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/158c502a-4b3e-463d-906f-529da13e2451\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/158c502a-4b3e-463d-906f-529da13e2451</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-18T22:28:43.529797", "ruling_date": "2016-12-19T13:37:57", "ruling_headline": "Is California's economy 'growing a hell of a lot faster' than Texas?", "ruling_headline_slug": "are-jobs-california-growing-hell-lot-faster-texas", "ruling_link_text": "California grew jobs, per capita income faster than Texas", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jerry Brown, speech at American Geophysical Union conference, Dec. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Deborah Hoffman, spokeswoman for Gov.
