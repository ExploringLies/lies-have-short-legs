You could kill someone and you cannot frighten a hurricane. I cant believe I actually have to write this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, one website pointed to the event and claimed it led to tragedy when a &quot;Myrtle Beach man&quot; did just that: shot a gun at a hurricane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The 33-year old is believed to have fired a large calibre (sic) weapon earlier this afternoon; however, the bullet ricocheted and ended up entering the man&rsquo;s head,&quot;<a href=\"http://cgcnews.com/myrtle-beach-man-who-shot-at-hurricane-florence-dies-after-bullet-ricochets/\"> the post said</a>. &quot;It&rsquo;s believed he died instantly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was made up. It was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\"> partnership with Facebook.</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partway through the story, the &quot;Myrtle Beach man&quot; is identified as a man from Florence, which is the name of the hurricane as well as a South Carolina city further inland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myrtle Beach&rsquo;s local newspaper,<a href=\"https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/state/north-carolina/article218402975.html\"> Myrtle Beach Online</a>, contacted police departments in both Florence and Myrtle Beach, and neither was aware of such an incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have not heard a a single call in any way, shape or form about anything like that,&quot; a police corporal in Myrtle Beach told the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only thing I&rsquo;ve heard about that was a satirical group on Facebook,&quot; Florence Police Department Lt. Mike Brandt told PolitiFact. &quot;There were no reports of shooting at the hurricane in the city limits of Florence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story was published on CGC News, a blog that was <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/cgcnews.com\">created </a>Sept. 9, 2018 according to whois.com, which tracks website domains. No credible news outlets covering the storm have picked up this story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Facebookers have somewhat jokingly declared they&rsquo;d shoot at an incoming storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The joke Facebook event is similar to one that popped up last year: &quot;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/126766931320280\">Shoot At Hurricane Irma.</a>&quot; The creator was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/41201494/people-like-ryon-are-going-to-shoot-at-hurricane-irma\">a bored 22-year-old</a> who said at the time that the joke became &quot;something a little out of my control&quot; after more than 43,000 people RSVPed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Facebook event &quot;Shooting guns at Hurricane Florence to scare it away&quot; has generated its fair share of interested attendees, there is no credible evidence that anyone died trying to square off against the hurricane.
