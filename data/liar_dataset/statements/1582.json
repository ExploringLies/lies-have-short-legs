She levelled six charges against Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White including these pops: &quot;He supports the &lsquo;ObamaCare&rsquo; socialized medicine plan, as well as &lsquo;Cap and Trade&rsquo; legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Socialist? Job-killer? We decided to test the politically potent charges. (We deal with the rest of Adams&#39; letter in separate Truth-O-Meter items.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Adams&rsquo; claim that White supports the &quot;&lsquo;ObamaCare&rsquo; socialized medicine plan,&quot; the Republican Party initially referred us to an August article in the El Paso Times. The story makes no reference to &quot;Obamacare&quot; or &quot;socialized medicine.&quot; Instead it quotes White saying he backs President Barack Obama&rsquo;s goals of allowing people to keep their current doctors and insurance plans and expanding the availability of health coverage while containing costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article also quotes White referring to his support for employers, employees and public-private partnerships to enable affordable basic health care. His campaign says White was among advocates who persuaded state lawmakers to permit &quot;3-share&quot; partnerships.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhite also has called for expanding the enrollment of children in Medicaid, which serves the poor, and the federally supported Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program, which serves the working poor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurprisingly, considering White was a Senate candidate through much of last year, White&#39;s campaign says he has not voiced support for any particular health-care plan before Congress.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Adams&rsquo; statement about White supporting a cap-and-trade approach to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the party pointed us to an article published in December&#39;s Texas Monthly magazine. Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available. Companies can then trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they&#39;re allowed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe article doesn&#39;t reveal White&rsquo;s position on the cap-and-trade idea. Rather, it quotes a press release from a Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman speculating about something White&#39;s campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, told the Austin American-Statesman in September: That White had advised Obama on energy topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP spokesman said: &quot;President Obama has proposed massive tax hikes on Texas energy companies and a cap-and-trade scheme that would raise energy prices on Texas families. Is this the result of the &lsquo;advice&rsquo; Mayor White&rsquo;s spokesperson referred to today? Texas voters deserve to know exactly which aspects of President Obama&rsquo;s energy scheme White supports.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier, White told the American-Statesman he didn&#39;t consider the cap-and-trade plan narrowly approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in June &quot;an effective piece of legislation for accomplishing its goals at a reasonable consumer cost... I&rsquo;ve shared some of those thoughts with senators, of how we could have an energy policy that&rsquo;s sustainable and also affordable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, White said he&#39;s never endorsed a cap-and-trade proposal, preferring approaches that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging utilities to use more natural gas and renewable energy. &quot;The closer somebody comes to that approach, the more I support it,&quot; White said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White also has called for Texas to follow states including California, New York and Massachusetts in adopting state-level low-emission vehicle standards so that &quot;we help drive down the cost of more fuel-efficient, lower-emission vehicles for all people in our country. Texas is the biggest state not to have adopted these standards. And I think the auto makers will see the writing on the wall if we do so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any politico can appreciate why Republicans want to portray White as favoring &quot;socialized medicine&quot; and cap-and-trade legislation critics say would slam the state&#39;s economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the absence of confirming facts, these sizzlers read like ridiculous smears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Adams&#39; statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-12T18:51:25.051527", "ruling_date": "2010-03-14T05:48:47", "ruling_headline": "Cathie Adams says Bill White supports \"ObamaCare socialized medicine plan\" and cap-and-trade", "ruling_headline_slug": "cathie-adams-who-chairs-texas-gop-says-bill-white-", "ruling_link_text": "Sizzling claims fizzle due to lack of proof", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The El Paso Times, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/08182009_elpasotimesarticle.doc\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Houston mayor vows to create jobs, fix health care,&quot;</a> Aug. 18, 2009 (Nexis search)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/03042010_katybaconemail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail</a>, Katy Bacon, press secretary, Bill White campaign, March 4, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/09212009_brianwalshnrscemail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail</a>, Brian Walsh, communications director, National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sept. 21, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews, Bill White, June 2008, September 2009, March 8, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican Party of Texas,<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/03032010_bryanprestontxgop.rtf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Response to PolitiFact Texas query\"> &quot;Bill White&rsquo;s Record,&quot;</a> received March 3, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas Monthly, <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/2009-12-01/feature2.php\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;The Great White Hope,&quot;</a> December 2009 accessed March 6, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill White gubernatorial campaign, <a href=\"http://www.billwhitefortexas.com/issues/health/\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Issues, Health Care,&quot;</a> accessed March 9, 2010<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Chair, Republican Party of Texas", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Cathie", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 340, "last_name": "Adams", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "cathie-adams", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/03122010_cathieadams.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/340/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.texasgop.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Bill White ... supports the &lsquo;ObamaCare&rsquo; socialized medicine plan, as well as &lsquo;Cap and Trade&rsquo; legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a fund-raising letter", "statement_date": "2010-02-20", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 116, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/116/", "subject": "Cap and Trade", "subject_slug": "cap-and-trade", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>Most scientists agree that climate change is real and humans are causing it.
