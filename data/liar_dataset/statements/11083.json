Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. After all, the billionaire is so friendly with Hillary Clinton, Trump invited her to his nuptials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think there&#39;s a small possibility that this gentleman is a phantom candidate,&quot; Curbelo told Miami radio host Roberto Rodr&iacute;guez Tejera <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/07/miami-republican-congressman-posits-donald-trump-candidacy-may-be-democratic-plot.html\">on July 10, 2015</a>. &quot;Mr. Trump has a close friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton. They were at his last wedding. He has contributed to the Clintons&#39; foundation. He has contributed to Mrs. Clinton&#39;s Senate campaigns. All of this is very suspicious.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not going to rule on whether Trump and the Clintons are friends -- as the old saying goes, &quot;If you want a friend in politics, get a dog!&quot; -- but we did want to find out if Curbelo had his wedding anecdote right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is, yes, the Clintons did attend Trump&rsquo;s 2005 wedding to Melania Knauss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, current Democratic presidential candidate Hillary was at the ceremony. Former President Bill didn&rsquo;t show up until the reception. Because who wouldn&rsquo;t want to participate in <em>that </em>Electric Slide lineup?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the then-58-year-old Trump&rsquo;s third wedding. Before he got hitched to Slovenian former model Knauss, who was 34 at the time, he had been married first to Ivana Trump and then Marla Maples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton had a front-pew seat at the Episcopal <a href=\"http://www.bbts.org/\">Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea</a> in Palm Beach for the wedding on Jan. 22, 2005. <em>People </em>magazine said that the <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1019657,00.html\">450-person guest list</a> included former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and media and entertainment personalities like Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Simon Cowell, Regis Philbin, Kelly Ripa, Star Jones and Barbara Walters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fun really started after the ceremony in the ballrom at Trump&rsquo;s own <a href=\"http://www.maralagoclub.com/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;PageId=278801&amp;ssid=153103&amp;vnf=1\">Mar-a-Lago Club</a> resort in Palm Beach. Bill Clinton showed up in time for a party that included performances by Billy Joel, Paul Anka and Tony Bennett. The reception also featured a 200-pound, 5-foot-tall wedding cake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for whether Trump contributed to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s senate campaigns, Trump has admitted as much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m a businessman, I contribute to everybody,&quot; Trump told Fox &amp; Friends <a href=\"http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/07/15/donald-trump-reacts-rep-carlos-curbelos-claim-hes-liberal-mole\">on July 15</a>.&nbsp;(PunditFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/09/ben-ferguson/donald-trumps-campaign-contributions-democrats-and/\">has found to be the case</a>.) &quot;That&rsquo;s part of the problem with the system. I contribute to everybody. When I need Hillary, she was there. If I say go to my wedding, they go to my wedding. I contribute to everybody and you know what, that&rsquo;s part of the problem with our system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump told the U.K.&rsquo;s<em> Daily Mail</em> in May that he had <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3082726/Hillary-Bill-Clinton-kiss-ss-foundation-dough-says-Donald-Trump-gave-100-000.html\">never gotten any favors</a> for his donations to the Clintons, &quot;but they do kiss my ass&quot; to get that money. He also has <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trumps-change-heart-hillary-clinton\">called Hillary Clinton</a> &quot;the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.&quot; Meanwhile, Bill Clinton told Jon Stewart <a href=\"http://www.eonline.com/news/668004/bill-clinton-talks-about-donald-trump-and-his-presidential-bid-so-is-he-voting-for-wife-hillary-clinton\">a month later</a> that The Donald had been &quot;uncommonly nice to Hillary and me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curbelo said Bill and Hillary Clinton were at Donald Trump&#39;s last wedding. Bill Clinton only made the reception, but Hillary Clinton did have a seat in the first row at the church in 2005. Both rubbed elbows with the stars at the reception. We rate Curbelo&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-17T14:27:29.857283", "ruling_date": "2015-07-21T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "The Clintons really did attend Donald Trump's 2005 wedding", "ruling_headline_slug": "clintons-really-did-attend-donald-trumps-2005-wedd", "ruling_link_text": "Hillary Clinton had a seat in the front pew", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Miami Herald</em> Naked Politics blog, &quot;<a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/07/miami-republican-congressman-posits-donald-trump-candidacy-may-be-democratic-plot.html\">Miami Republican congressman posits Donald Trump candidacy may be Democratic plot</a>,&quot; July 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>People</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1019657,00.html\">Donald Trump Weds Melania Knauss</a>,&quot; Jan. 23, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Daily Mail</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3082726/Hillary-Bill-Clinton-kiss-ss-foundation-dough-says-Donald-Trump-gave-100-000.html\">Hillary and Bill Clinton &#39;kiss my *ss&#39; for foundation dough, says Donald Trump &ndash; who gave at least $100,000</a>,&quot; May 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/donald-trump-donations-democrats-hillary-clinton-119071.html\">Donald Trump has spent years courting Hillary and other Dems</a>,&quot; June 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-16/fyi-hillary-clinton-had-a-front-pew-seat-at-donald-trump-s-wedding\">FYI: Hillary Clinton Had a Front-Pew Seat at Donald Trump&#39;s Wedding</a>,&quot; June 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/245406-bill-clinton-trump-has-been-uncommonly-nice-to-hillary\">Bill Clinton: Trump has been &#39;uncommonly nice&#39; to Hillary</a>,&quot; June 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/19/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-remarks/\">Knocking Trump, Clinton implies &#39;inflammatory&#39; remarks can spur shootings</a>,&quot; June 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E!
