He didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe annual deficit, meaning the difference between what the government is spending and what it&rsquo;s raising from taxes and other sources, has grown on Obama&rsquo;s watch. According to a White House <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist01z1.xls\">historical table</a>, the deficit was $458.6 billion in 2008, the year he won election. It reached $1.4 trillion in 2009, a year over which he and his predecessor, George W. Bush, both held budgetary sway.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe deficit was nearly $1.3 trillion in 2010. And according to a November 2011 report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit was also $1.3 trillion for fiscal 2011, which ran through September 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd did the Democratic president promise to cut the deficit in half?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBingo. PolitiFact noted in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/24/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-obama-going-break-promise-deficit-an/\">June 2011 fact check</a> that <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/presdocs/2009/DCPD200900102.pdf\">Obama said</a> at a &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot; summit at the White House in February 2009: &quot;I&#39;m pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama continued: &quot;Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we&#39;ve long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEarlier in his remarks, Obama said his administration had &quot;inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit&mdash;the largest in our nation&#39;s history.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter making his pledge, Obama said the budget he would soon propose &quot;will look ahead 10 years and will include a full and honest accounting of the money we plan to spend and the deficits we will likely incur. To start reducing these deficits, I&#39;ve committed to going through our budget line by line to root out waste and inefficiency.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama went on to say he was intent on restoring pay-as-you-go budgeting and also ending the &quot;payments to agribusiness that don&#39;t need them and eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq. We&#39;ll end the tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas,&quot; he said, &quot;and we&#39;ll stop the fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Mackowiak&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-01T18:29:40.866456", "ruling_date": "2011-12-02T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Republican consultant says Barack Obama promised to halve federal deficit in his first term", "ruling_headline_slug": "Republican-consultant-Barack-Obama-promise-deficit", "ruling_link_text": "Three Februarys ago", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, report, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/125xx/doc12541/2011_Nov_MBR.pdf\">&quot;Monthly Budget Review, November 2011,&quot;</a> Nov. 7, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitifact, Truth-O-Meter article, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/24/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-obama-going-break-promise-deficit-an/\">&quot;Tim Pawlenty says President Obama is going to break promise on deficit and will double it,&quot;</a> June 24, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Consultant", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Matt", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1560, "last_name": "Mackowiak", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "matt-mackowiak", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mackonew040213.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1560/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.mattmackowiak.com/index.php/site/about/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Barack Obama promised to halve the deficit in his first term.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an opinion column.", "statement_date": "2011-12-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
