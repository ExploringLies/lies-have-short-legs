He described the idea as bare bones, saying Abele has not fleshed out how it would work or explored all the legal angles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the tax, legal and legislative experts we talked to said Wisconsin&rsquo;s state constitution and various state Supreme Court cases create major barriers to these kinds of special property tax exemptions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe assessment from experts: Abele&rsquo;s proposal almost certainly isn&rsquo;t going to fly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd there&rsquo;s no way Milwaukee County can do it alone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe central point in the analysis of Abele&rsquo;s plan is the &quot;uniformity clause&quot; in the Wisconsin state constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe clause was &quot;intended to prevent the legislature and local officials from granting preferential tax treatment to influential property owners and protect the citizen against unequal, and consequently unjust taxation,&quot; according to a 2002 <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/consthi/02consthiII02.htm\">Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau paper</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe author of that paper, reference bureau attorney Joseph Kreye, said Abele&rsquo;s plan almost assuredly would run afoul of uniformity, and would almost certainly draw lawsuits from existing businesses that don&rsquo;t get the tax break.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKreye is the attorney who checks state bills for compliance with the uniformity clause.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTodd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group, agreed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you are going to pick property tax payers and you favor some and not others, even though they are the same &ndash; both business, both homeowners or retail stores &ndash; the constitution says you can&rsquo;t do that,&quot; Berry said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMunicipalities, such as Milwaukee County, are particularly hamstrung.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6xzlfa2\">League of Wisconsin Municipalities </a><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6xzlfa2\">paper</a> on the uniformity clause put it bluntly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Can a municipality grant a full or partial property tax exemption to a property owner or a business? No.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Legislature can classify and exempt whole classes of property -- such as agriculture -- from uniform taxation, the League&rsquo;s paper noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt added (italics ours): &quot;Unlike the state, municipalities do not have the power to create full or partial exemptions and a municipality may not lawfully grant a property tax break because such action would violate the uniformity clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. <em>Thus, the assessment of property cannot be frozen as an incentive for businesses to locate in a community</em>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele&rsquo;s spokesman told us it&rsquo;s at least theoretically possible his plan could get around that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s possible, Lorenz said, that Abele would try to define &quot;new small businesses&quot; as a special class of property. If a legal challenge resulted, there&rsquo;s a chance the county could prevail, Lorenz said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Kreye said that while the Legislature could exempt whole classes of property from taxation, carving out certain businesses within one class for special treatment is problematic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele&rsquo;s camp offered one more defense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLorenz said that Abele thought of his plan as a county version of Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s plan for a two-year income tax break for firms that relocate to Wisconsin. Walker signed that bill on Jan. 31 -- and legal concerns were not an issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Walker&rsquo;s plan involves income taxes, not property taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe uniformity clause &quot;does not apply to income taxes,&quot; said state Legislative Reference Bureau attorney Marc Shovers, an income tax specialist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis one&rsquo;s clear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele is touting his idea of granting special property tax breaks to certain businesses. But well-established legal principles, the state&rsquo;s constitution and expert opinion strongly suggests that not even the Legislature could make this happen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe lack of detail in Abele&rsquo;s plan may be the best thing going for it, because it&rsquo;s harder to judge. But it also makes clear how far off base he was in presenting this as a simple matter of a pen stroke by the new county executive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-07T18:45:52.191837", "ruling_date": "2011-02-09T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Milwaukee County executive candidate says property tax exemptions can be granted to small businesses that move into the county", "ruling_headline_slug": "milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-says-property", "ruling_link_text": "State constitution, court rulings and experts say otherwise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterviews with Brandon Lorenz, Abele press spokesman, Feb. 2-3, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Marc Shovers, Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau staff attorney, Feb. 2, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Jon Peacock, director, Wisconsin Budget Project, Feb. 3, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Joseph Kreye, senior attorney, Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, Feb. 4, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Todd Berry, president, Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, Feb. 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChris Abele, <a href=\"http://www.chrisabele.com/issues/jobs/\">video of tax announcement,</a>Jan. 31, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChris Abele, <a href=\"http://www.chrisabele.com/2011/01/31/chris-abele-announces-job-creation-and-economic-development-plan/\">campaign news release</a>, Jan. 31, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/consthi/02consthiII02.htm\">The Uniformity Clause</a>, 2002<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin League of Wisconsin Municipalities, <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/preview.php?num=6xzlfa2\">Taxation FAQ 7</a>, accessed Feb. 2, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWisconsin Budget Project, <a href=\"http://www.wccf.org/pdf/proptaxreliefwi_uniclause.pdf\">Property Tax Relief in Wisconsin: The Uniformity Clause</a>, accessed Feb. 2, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Philanthropist", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "", "id": 959, "last_name": "Abele", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "chris-abele", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Abele_Chris_PFACT_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/959/", "total_count": 22, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://chrisabele.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tProperty tax exemptions can be granted to small businesses that move into Milwaukee County.</p>", "statement_context": "a campaign news release", "statement_date": "2011-01-31", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 140, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/140/", "subject": "Small Business", "subject_slug": "small-business", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
