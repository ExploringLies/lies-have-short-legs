The White House quickly said that the president was simply trying to say that state and local governments need help to stem job losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut U.S. Sen. Rob Portman saw it differently. Portman, an Ohio Republican, <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/06/as_president_obama_comes_to_oh.html\">told a conference call with reporters</a> on June 14 that Obama&rsquo;s point was that &quot;the reason the economy is weak is because we are losing too many government jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether Portman accurately interpreted Obama&rsquo;s point or not, he quickly moved to knock it down. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well first of all,&quot; Portman said, &quot;we are not losing government jobs. If you look at the overall net jobs in the federal government, we&rsquo;ve actually seen an increase in federal government jobs, and pretty substantially. There have been some reductions in state and local jobs, I don&rsquo;t know what the net number is, but I would just make the point that I made earlier: If you are looking to grow the economy, the way to grow the economy is not to grow more public-sector jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis claim that the federal government has added jobs, published on Cleveland.com, The Plain Dealer&rsquo;s online arm, caught the attention of a skeptical reader. PolitiFact Ohio agreed it was worth examining.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHas the federal government substantially increased its hiring?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPortman did not specify a period for this purported increase, but his comments were about the weak economic recovery and what he says was Obama&rsquo;s inadequate approach dating to the stimulus. So we&rsquo;ll use the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in February 2009, as the baseline.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal government had nearly 2.8 million employees when the stimulus passed. (The exact number, important here, is 2.795 million.) Then, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe number grew to 3.4 million by May 2010. PolitiFact has examined that growth spurt several times and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/aug/18/steve-latourette/rep-steve-latourette-says-stimulus-has-done-little/\">found it was because of temporary 2010 Census hiring</a>, long-planned and independent of any White House action.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tBy October 2010, the number of federal workers had dropped to 2.86 million and by May 2012, the most recent most available, it was projected to be 2.819 million.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe number has dropped slowly every single month since March 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou can assess this a couple of ways. The trend for more than a year has been downward, while the net number since the stimulus passed in early 2009 is up -- by 24,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet Portman&rsquo;s point was clear: that the proper way to grow the economy is through private sector jobs, not public sector jobs. He didn&rsquo;t say federal jobs have inched upward. He said they have grown &quot;pretty substantially.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow big is substantial?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal employment on net has grown by less than 1 percent since the stimulus passed, BLS data and our calculator show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis characterization of state and local government employment is correct. State employment fell from 5.188 million workers when the stimulus passed to 5.073 million in May, or by 115,000 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the local government level, cities, towns, townships and counties dropped overall employment from 14.594 million when the stimulus passed to 14.077 million in May, a loss of 517,000 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe losses came as local and state governments cut their payrolls in response to lower tax collections -- itself a result of the weak economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for federal employment, the subject of Portman&rsquo;s claim, it &nbsp;shows a net growth in the three-plus years since the stimulus passed, but that growth is modest at best, and it is now trending downward month after month. Characterizing a net increase of less than 1 percent as substantial is inaccurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Portman&rsquo;s claim rates False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-19T18:50:17.910158", "ruling_date": "2012-06-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rob Portman says there has been a substantial increase in federal government jobs under Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "rob-portman-says-there-has-been-substantial-increa", "ruling_link_text": "Substantially misleading", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSen.
