But we flipped on the Texas Truth-O-Meter after John Patrick, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said at a January 2017 Capitol press conference: &quot;If you have a family, the current minimum wage easily qualifies you for food stamps.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Food stamps&quot; is an outdated term referring to food benefits available to income-eligible residents through the federal <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a>. Beneficiaries purchase food and groceries using electronic benefit transfer cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationally on average in 2015, about 45.8 million people in 22.5 million households monthly participated in SNAP, according to the federal government, and because benefits are available to most low-income households, participants represent a broad cross-section of the nation&#39;s poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A November 2016 U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/ops/Characteristics2015-Summary.pdf\">report</a> states that in the year, 55 percent of SNAP households with children included people with jobs. Still, the average gross income of participating households was $786 a month, the report says, which breaks out to $9,432 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the Texas AFL-CIO for the basis of Patrick&rsquo;s claim. By email, spokesman Ed Sills said a full-time minimum-wage Texas worker earns $7.25 an hour (<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage\">identical to the federal minimum</a>). Multiplied over 2,000 work hours in a year, that&rsquo;s an annual income of approximately $14,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The labor group&rsquo;s use of 2,000 hours in a work year contrasts with the 2,087-hour work year used <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/computing-hourly-rates-of-pay-using-the-2087-hour-divisor/\">by the federal government</a> in its data assumptions. Using that figure, a single full-time worker would earn $15,130 in a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sills otherwise said that according to maximum monthly income limits posted by the state, a family could easily qualify for SNAP with a single worker earning the minimum wage. He pointed out the relevant chart, posted on a Texas Health and Human Services Commission web page titled &nbsp;<a href=\"https://yourtexasbenefits.hhsc.texas.gov/programs/snap\">&quot;SNAP Food Benefits.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We proceeded to crunch the figures, which mostly supported Patrick&rsquo;s claim, though we also noticed Patrick hadn&rsquo;t said if he was thinking solely of families with one full-time minimum-wage worker; Sills told us by phone that he believed so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A twist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then came a twist causing us to realize the commission-posted figures were out of date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recognized as much when Christine Mann, a commission press officer, responded to our inquiry about Patrick&rsquo;s claim by providing SNAP-eligibility household income thresholds lower than the thresholds on the agency&rsquo;s SNAP food benefits web page--which Mann told us would be updated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mann later provided a commission <a href=\"https://hhs.texas.gov/laws-regulations/handbooks/part-c-appendix/twh-c-100-income-limits-and-proration-charts\">web link</a> to the up-to-date income eligibility figures. For our part, we spotted the same income-eligibility numbers on a <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility#Income\">USDA web page</a> that describes the figures as in effect for the fiscal year running through September 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mann&rsquo;s response also indicated that qualifying for SNAP is more complicated than simply grossing less than a particular threshold. &quot;Eligibility for SNAP is based on household size, the countable amount of gross and net income for all mandatory household members, and allowed deductions&quot; for items including shelter, utilities, child care and medical expenses, Mann wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Agency confirmation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mann otherwise told us that a single minimum-wage full-time worker in a household of two to three people would draw monthly gross income of $1,255.70. In support of Patrick&rsquo;s claim, that amount runs short of the up-to-date income thresholds to qualify for SNAP of $1,736 a month for a two-person household or $2,184 a month for a three-person household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bigger households with a single full-time minimum-wage worker would qualify too, we calculated, as would households of four or more with two full-time minimum-wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We identified one exception: A household of three with two full-time minimum-wage workers, which would have a combined gross monthly income of $2,511.40, would earn too much to qualify for SNAP at the qualifying gross-income threshold of $2,184 a month for a household of three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We separately asked the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, <a href=\"http://forabettertexas.org/whatwedoandwhy.html\">which says</a> it advocates for conditions enabling every Texan to be healthy, well-educated and financially secure, to assess Patrick&rsquo;s statement. By email, Oliver Bernstein described calculations like our own; he said the claim holds up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick said that in Texas, &quot;if you have a family, the current minimum wage easily qualifies you for food stamps.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our finding is that a household of two or more residents including a single full-time minimum-wage worker would clearly qualify for SNAP as would a household of four or more with two full-time minimum-wage workers. A three-person household with two such workers would gross too much to qualify.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
