Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to say the economy is bouncing back from the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em> March 8, host Chuck Todd noted that unemployment is at its lowest since May 2008. And in 2014, unemployment went down in every state &mdash; a first since 1984. Todd asked Graham if Republicans &mdash; who have criticized President Barack Obama&rsquo;s economic policies &mdash; could admit that some progress has been made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think that we do have stagnant middle-class wage growth, and I think the labor participation rate is at an all-time low,&quot; Graham said. &quot;So if your argument is that we&rsquo;re on the road to recovery, we had a sound economy under President Obama, no I don&rsquo;t agree with that at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pointing out that the labor participation rate has been on the decline is a typical retort among Republicans&nbsp;in response to arguments that the unemployment rate is shrinking. While low unemployment rate is generally a good thing, economists also say you want a high labor participation rate. That&rsquo;s because the higher the rate, the more members of the working-age population that are actively seeking employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is today&rsquo;s labor participation rate at an &quot;all-time low&quot;? Not so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of February, the labor participation rate is 62.8 percent, according to the federal <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rates were consistently lower than what they are today from 1948 through 1978 &mdash; with the lowest point at 58.1 percent in December 1954. (Available data goes back to 1948.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below is a <a href=\"http://tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=unitedstalabforparra&amp;d1=19500101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;h=350&amp;w=800&amp;ref=/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>graph</u></a> showing the trend since 1950:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kdoqkXfZGK22reK0QUHvkcFkVwrebibRRVdVlSDNn67ZvK72NIjgt2Eks-U2ljTzr1QW7KIyL9jB0L7Uy3sBuBcFNOxpUdKS4555WI3oYZ5o8a6379t4FIIMLbc-EPTZZ4dFIsU\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:315px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fairness to Graham, today&rsquo;s labor participation rate is essentially the lowest it&rsquo;s been <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/26/ted-cruz/labor-force-participation-its-lowest-point-1978-sa/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>since 1978</u></a>. The rate increased steadily from the mid 1960s through the late 1990s, when it hit a peak of 67 percent. Since Obama has been in office, the rate has dropped 2.9 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the increase in the labor participation rate in the second half of the 20th century largely has to do with a massive increase in the number of women seeking employment as a result of changes such as better access to contraceptives and anti-gender discrimination legislation, according to an economic report out of the <a href=\"http://m.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/labor_force_participation_report.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>White House</u></a>, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This major social difference in the country&rsquo;s workforce makes it difficult to compare labor participation rates today to those 50 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important reason for labor participation rate increase through the 1990s was the fact that baby boomers reached their &quot;peak working years,&quot; according to the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Factors contributing to current decline are up for debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the one hand, there&rsquo;s concern that people are discouraged about their <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU05026645\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>job prospects</u></a>. The slow recovery from the recent recession may have prompted people to go back to school, stay at home with their kids or give up on a job search altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But absent the recession, labor participation would have dropped anyway, Brookings economist Gary Burtless told <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/12/cathy-mcmorris-rodgers/rep-cathy-mcmorris-rodgers-says-fewer-now-working-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact in 2013</u></a>. Why? Because the baby boomers have started to retire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as the population gets older, fewer people will be working overall, meaning the labor participation rate will continue to decline in the coming decade, according to the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/article/labor-force-projections-to-2022-the-labor-force-participation-rate-continues-to-fall.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally the rate of female labor participation &mdash; which increased rapidly through the 1990s &mdash;&nbsp;has since plateaued and declined slightly. (The labor participation rate among men has decreased more.) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House report found that half the decline in labor participation is a result of the aging population, while the other half is a combination of cyclical economic trends, the recession&nbsp;and existing trends such as the decline of female workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also notes that while labor force participation among young adults has declined about 0.8 percentage points a year since 2007, school and college enrollment has increased. So the rate of young adults either working or in school has remained relatively unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graham said, &quot;The labor participation rate is at an all-time low.&quot; &nbsp;Graham&rsquo;s office did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate was lower than it is today from 1948 to 1978. That said, it&#39;s not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison and the labor participation is at about its lowest level in 37&nbsp;years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We&nbsp;rate&nbsp;it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-08T10:44:34.998853", "ruling_date": "2015-03-08T10:44:24", "ruling_headline": "Lindsey Graham has it wrong on 'Meet the Press': Labor participation rate is not at an all-time low", "ruling_headline_slug": "lindsey-graham-has-it-wrong-meet-press-labor-parti", "ruling_link_text": "We'll try not to belabor the point", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NBC, <em>Meet the Press</em> transcript, March 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey</u></a>,&quot; accessed March 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"http://m.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/labor_force_participation_report.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The labor force participation rate since 2007: Causes and policy implications,</u></a>&quot; July 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quartz, &quot;<a href=\"http://qz.com/286213/the-chart-obama-haters-love-most-and-the-truth-behind-it/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The chart Obama-haters love most&mdash;and the truth behind it,</u></a>&quot; Nov. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/07/business/economy/jobs-report-unemployment-february.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>After a Bounce, Wage Growth Slumps to 0.1%</u></a>,&quot; March 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/may/will-labor-force-participation-bounce-back/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Will Labor Force Participation Bounce Back?</u></a>&quot; May 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/26/ted-cruz/labor-force-participation-its-lowest-point-1978-sa/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Labor force participation is at lowest point since 1978, says Texas Sen.
