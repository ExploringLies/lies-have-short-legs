Facebook brought it to our attention as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to clear its news feeds of fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post <a href=\"http://clashdaily.com/2015/11/muslims-are-offended-at-national-anthem-they-say-its-forcing-them-to/\">was one of</a> <a href=\"http://www.jewsnews.co.il/2015/11/01/muslims-whine-that-singing-the-national-anthem-is-forced-assimilation-and-it-offends-them.html\">many others</a> <a href=\"http://bb4sp.com/islamic-leader-says-muslim-schoolchildren-shouldnt-have-to-sing-national-anthem/#\">across cyberspace</a> <a href=\"http://usherald.com/offended-kids-national-anthem-forcing-recite/\">that discussed</a> how an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children must sing the national anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though some choppy grammar and poor editing made it difficult to know what was a direct quote, we gleaned that a Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman named Unthman Badar said the national anthem was part of a concerted effort of &quot;forced assimilation&quot; of Muslims by Australian officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the post included two deceptive photos of schoolchildren standing at attention before an American flag in a classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: There is a controversial pro-Islamic group called <a href=\"http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/en/\">Hizb-ut-Tahrir</a>, and their spokesman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/uthmanb?lang=en\">Uthman Badar</a> (note the spelling difference) did say Muslim children should not sing the national anthem. But what&rsquo;s not entirely clear from the story is that this happened during a contentious meeting about the strain of Islamic citizens assimilating into Australian culture, held in Sydney on Nov. 1, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This imposition of values is manifest in matters such as the insistence of senior government ministers that Muslim children sing the national anthem &ndash; an anthem which reflects a particular, disputed view of history and celebrates particular ideological values ... Why should they be forced to sing it?&quot; Badar said, according to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/muslim-children-should-not-be-forced-to-sing-national-anthem-says-hizb-uttahrir-20151101-gknwy9.html\">news reports</a>.

It includes the caption, &quot;If you&#39;re offended by our beautiful flag, representing the blood that has been shed defending this great country, you can go back to the hell hole you came from!!&quot; The LadyLibertysNews.com&nbsp;Facebook page includes a picture of President Donald Trump taking the oath of office and is written from an American perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To the site&rsquo;s credit, when we contacted them via Facebook message about the post on Feb. 20, they conceded the photo choice was incorrect. Shortly thereafter, they changed the images to a single photo of the Australian flag. As of this writing, they have not amended their Facebook post, which had been shared more than 13,000 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A blog post claiming that Muslims are offended &quot;their kids have to recite national anthem&quot; linked to a deceptively edited post that includes images of children standing at attention before an American flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, the genesis of the story is not from America but Australia, where a spokesman for an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children should be forced to sing the Australian national anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post, which has been altered after we inquired, is definitely misleading but not altogether fake. It also comes from 2015, which isn&rsquo;t mentioned in the post being virally shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2c234c61-4e3b-42c7-b5cf-8e290480c157\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2c234c61-4e3b-42c7-b5cf-8e290480c157</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-21T13:06:34.333946", "ruling_date": "2017-02-21T16:09:46", "ruling_headline": "Muslims offended their kids have to sing the national anthem?
