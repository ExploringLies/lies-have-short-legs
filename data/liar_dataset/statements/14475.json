It&rsquo;s just that we can&rsquo;t find any evidence that Sandler actually said any of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post said Sandler was on an unnamed podcast when the atheist host began to disparage religion in general and Mormons in particular. Sandler, who grew up in a Jewish family, spoke up to defend the faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know, Tom. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you&rsquo;re just having some fun here but &mdash; from my experience &mdash; Mormons are some of the most decent people I&rsquo;ve ever come across,&quot; the story attributed to Sandler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said more in the post, but they aren&rsquo;t real quotes. Apart from there being a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NlX-ku8fWNU\">parody out there</a> of his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8eB4PkCo4Lo\">Hanukkah Song</a> adapted for Mormons, we really couldn&rsquo;t find him making much of any comment about Mormons at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s because WRPM33.com and scads of other sites are posting a made-up story. &quot;Most of the articles on wrpm33.com are works of fantasy or satire and are not true,&quot; the <a href=\"http://wrpm33.com/disclaimer/\">site&rsquo;s disclaimer said</a>. The sites use domain names that sound like official media outlets, but don&rsquo;t contain any apparent contact information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the same kinds of websites responsible for other stories we&rsquo;ve looked at that claim celebrities have said or done things they haven&rsquo;t. One popular story said that a celebrity made nice comments about the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/06/blog-posting/celebrity-praise-helpful-locals-are-fake-stories-c/\">residents of a town after car trouble</a>. Another post claimed that a celebrity enjoyed a town so much, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/30/blog-posting/no-leonardo-dicaprio-isnt-moving-orlando-suburb/\">they are moving there</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both cases, the name of the town and celebrity can change, with the bulk of the story staying the same. There&rsquo;s even another subset of links telling readers that a Star Wars movie will be <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/fake-news-next-star-wars-movie-isnt-seeking-extras/\">filming near their city</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The object is clearly to get residents of the town named to click on the link, to earn advertising revenue for the (unidentified) owners of the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen another version of this story that <a href=\"http://kty24news.com/hollywood/what-matthew-mcconaughey-is-saying-about-mormons/\">attributed the same quotes to Matthew McConaughey</a>. More are sure to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware that links you see about celebrity news may be fabricated, especially if they mention a smaller location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a friendly sentiment, but Sandler didn&rsquo;t say these things. We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-29T12:05:33.495833", "ruling_date": "2017-08-29T14:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Fake news sites say celebrities praise Mormons, but quotes are made up", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-news-sites-say-celebrities-praise-mormons-quo", "ruling_link_text": "More attempts to draw in readers with fake quotes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WRPM33.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://wrpm33.com/celebrity/what-adam-sandler-is-saying-about-mormons-6/\">What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/06/blog-posting/celebrity-praise-helpful-locals-are-fake-stories-c/\">No, a celebrity&#39;s car didn&#39;t break down in your hometown</a>,&quot; Jan. 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Texas, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/fake-news-next-star-wars-movie-isnt-seeking-extras/\">Fake news: Next Star Wars movie seeking alien extras near Houston</a>,&quot; April 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/30/blog-posting/no-leonardo-dicaprio-isnt-moving-orlando-suburb/\">No, Leonardo DiCaprio isn&#39;t moving to an Orlando suburb</a>,&quot; June 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KRB7News.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://krb7news.com/celebrity/what-adam-sandler-is-saying-about-mormons-7/\">What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WestfieldPost.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.westfieldpost.com/celebrity/what-adam-sandler-is-saying-about-mormons-4/\">What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KTY24News.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://kty24news.com/hollywood/what-matthew-mcconaughey-is-saying-about-mormons/\">What Matthew McConaughey is saying about Mormons</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 25, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Adam Sandler said &quot;Mormons are some of the most decent people I&rsquo;ve ever come across.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Internet posts", "statement_date": "2017-08-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
