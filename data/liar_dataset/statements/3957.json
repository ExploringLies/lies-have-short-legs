The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the Senate, is saying the stimulus failed to put Americans back to work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;President Obama and liberal former DNC Chairman Tim Kaine&rsquo;s $787 billion stimulus failed to create jobs,&quot; the NRSC said in a June 3 press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid the stimulus really fail to create jobs? Lots of Republicans are saying that, and we thought we&rsquo;d take a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChris Bond, a spokesman for the NRSC, said the statement is based on Kaine&rsquo;s assurances in February 2009 that the stimulus would save or create 3 million jobs. Bond also noted that the unemployment rate is at 9.1 percent and has been above 8 percent for 28 months in a row.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the NRSC press release says nothing about 3 million jobs. The statement simply charges that the stimulus &quot;failed to create jobs.&quot; This is an old Republicans charge. Earlier this month we gave House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, a <a href=\"http://politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/jun/03/eric-cantor/cantor-says-stimulus-failed-get-people-back-work/\">False</a>&nbsp;rating when he said the stimulus &quot;failed to get people back to work.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review some of the evidence we found then.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe White House has posted on its <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/default.aspx\">stimulus website</a>&nbsp;a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Between February 17, 2009 and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans, which account for one-third of the cost of the stimulus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia had a reported 11,446 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite House data shows the bulk of the Virginia jobs -- 7,203 full-time equivalent positions -- were in downtown Richmond where the state government relied on stimulus funds to balance budgets from 2009 to 2011. That number may paint an exaggerated picture, however, because the state parceled much of the stimulus money to localities to help support schools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCharles Pyle, a spokesman for the state&rsquo;s department of education, said that as of January 2011, Virginia school divisions reported they had saved 5,692 jobs and created another 926 jobs using stimulus money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA March <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/20110318-cea-arra-report.pdf\">report</a>&nbsp;by the president&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, the council&rsquo;s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here&rsquo;s what the groups found:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*Moody&rsquo;s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA side note: We also found it a stretch that the NRSC is giving Obama and Kaine equal ownership of the stimulus. Kaine was governor in 2009 and never voted on the bill nor participated in its drafting. Later, he did emerge as a key spokesman for stimulus as Obama&rsquo;s hand-picked DNC chairman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRSC says the stimulus &nbsp;&quot;failed to create jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe stimulus may &nbsp;not have created as many jobs as Republicans and Democrats hoped. But there&rsquo;s no doubt it put many people back to work and preserved the jobs of many more. We rate the NRSC statement False.&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-17T09:25:19.982274", "ruling_date": "2011-06-20T14:10:24", "ruling_headline": "GOP senate group says Tim Kaine's stimulus failed to create jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-senate-group-says-tim-kaines-stimulus-failed-c", "ruling_link_text": "Another stimulus attack, another False", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNational Republican Senatorial Committee, <a href=\"http://www.nrsc.org/2011/06/unemployment-rises-to-9-1-in-wake-of-kaine-obama%E2%80%99s-failed-787-billion-stimulus/\">Unemployment rises to 9.1 percent in wake of Kaine and Obama&rsquo;s failed $787 billion stimulus</a>, June 3, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, accessed June 2, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Chris Bond, spokesman, National Republican Senatorial Committee, June 16, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office Report, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12185/05-25-ARRA.pdf\">Estimated impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment and economic output from January 2011 through March 2011,&quot;</a>May 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office report, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12074/02-23-ARRA.pdf\">&quot;Estimated impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment and economic output from October 2010 through December 2010,&quot;</a>&nbsp;February 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFiscal Times, <a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2011/05/12/Bernanke-Defends-Stimulus-Takes-Boehner-to-Task.aspx\">&quot;Bernanke defends stimulus; takes Boehner to task,&quot;</a>&nbsp;May 12, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia state government,<a href=\"http://www.arra.virginia.gov/\">stimulus bill spending</a>, accessed June 1, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite House, <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/default.aspx\">stimulus bill spending</a>, accessed May 31, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/sep/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-stimulus-create-single-private-job/\">&quot;Rick Scott says the stimulus did not create a single private sector job,</a>&quot; Sept. 17, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact national article, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/17/barack-obama/obama-says-stimulus-responsible-millions-jobs-save/\">&quot;Obama says stimulus is responsible for 2 million jobs created or saved,&quot;</a>&nbsp;February 17, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact national article, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/18/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-stimulus-didnt-create-one-new-job/\">&quot;Scott Brown says stimulus &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t create one new job&rsquo;,</a>&nbsp;February 18, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTestimony of Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody&rsquo;s Economy.com, before <a href=\"http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/JEC-Fiscal-Stimulus-102909.pdf\">the Joint Economic Committee</a>, Oct. 29, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTalking Points Memo, <a href=\"http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/02/tim-kaine-hits-gopers-for-hypocrisy-on-stimulus-funds.php\">Tim Kaine to stimulus-hungry, stimulus-hating GOPers: you&rsquo;re hypocrites</a>, Feb. 17, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Washington Examiner</em>, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/virginia/2009/07/kaine-stimulus-has-generated-over-1-billion-va-infrastructure\">Kaine: Stimulus has generated over $1 billion for Va. infrastructure</a>, July 21, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnited States Congress, <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00001:@@@R\">H.R. 1: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a>, Feb. 17, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReport by incoming White House economists Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, <a href=\"http://otrans.3cdn.net/45593e8ecbd339d074_l3m6bt1te.pdf\">&quot;The job impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan,&quot;</a>&nbsp;January 9, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCNN, <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/21/kaine-officially-becomes-dnc-chair/\">Kaine officially becomes DNC chair</a>, Jan. 21, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Daily Press</em>, <a href=\"http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-59679sy0feb18,0,2915296.story\">Gov.
