At least that&rsquo;s the picture Gov. Rick Scott painted during a June 24, 2013, interview on <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/2503530225001/gov-scott-on-floridas-approach-to-boosting-jobs/?playlist_id=928378949001\">Fox News</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;That&rsquo;s why companies like just today, Deutsche Bank, added 300 jobs right here in Florida,&quot; Scott told host Stuart Varney on <em>Your World with Neil Cavuto</em>. &quot;Last week, I was with the Paris Air Show. We have companies from France, companies from Virginia moving to Florida. So it&rsquo;s clearly working in our state. And I hope you&rsquo;ll buy a one-way ticket and do your show down here.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVarney chuckled, then pressed for more details. &quot;That&rsquo;s an invitation I might just take up. Quickly though, Deutsche Bank, they&rsquo;re bringing 300 jobs to Florida, I think they&rsquo;re going to Jacksonville. Can you tell me, did you offer them something special? Did you say, I&rsquo;ll build you an exit off the freeway? No property taxes for a time? Did you do anything like that at all to get them in?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tScott dismissed the notion. &quot;No, what we do is we make sure we have an educated workforce. You know, you can&rsquo;t have a lower income tax than zero. Our business taxes are going down every year, so that&rsquo;s happening. I cut the, I got rid of the sales tax on machinery and equipment for our manufacturers. So every year, we&rsquo;re trying to make our state a state that no one can compete with because we like jobs. We like businesses. I want to make sure we&rsquo;re the No. 1 state for your family to get a job, get a great education and afford to live.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered whether Florida nabbed a big jobs deal without offering &quot;something special,&quot; as Varney put it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a statement tied to the jobs announcement, the managing director of Deutsche Bank Jacksonville hailed the &quot;tremendous support from the state of Florida and the City of Jacksonville,&quot; which he said &quot;played a large part in our decision to increase our footprint at this location.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat kind of support? The state wouldn&rsquo;t tell us, saying that information is shielded from public records laws, but a look at news clips and city council legislation filled in the blanks well enough.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe short answer: money.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDeutsche Bank has received a bevy of state and local tax incentives since starting a Jacksonvillle campus in 2008. That year, Deutsche Bank chose Jacksonville over Nashville, Tenn., and Charlotte, N.C., as the site for expanding two subsidiary companies, according to the<em> Florida Times-Union</em>. The expansion came with the promise of $4.8 million in state and local incentives for creating 1,000 jobs and doing capital investment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the summer of <a href=\"http://cityclts.coj.net/docs/2012-0487/Fact%20Sheet/2012-487.pdf\">2012,</a> state and local governments offered another $1.45 million to create 260 jobs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFast forward to the most recent expansion, which Scott highlighted in his comments. In April, the Jacksonville City Council <a href=\"http://cityclts.coj.net/coj/COJBillList.asp?Bill=2013-0183\">agreed to partner</a>&nbsp;with the state to offer $2.08 million in tax incentives to Deutsche Bank in exchange for adding 300 jobs over three years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe jobs would pay about $62,000 a year on average and bring the total Jacksonville workforce to 1,600 by 2016, according to city records.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the plan, Deutsche Bank would receive up to $1.8 million in tax refunds through the Qualified Target Industry program, with Jacksonville paying 20 percent ($360,000) and the state paying the rest.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe bank could also recover $140,000 in property taxes based on a pledge to spend $10 million in renovations to its office space and buy new furniture and technology.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeparately, Jacksonville&rsquo;s Office of Economic Development said Scott has agreed to contribute an additional $140,000 from a pot of incentive money used largely at the governor&rsquo;s discretion to close deals. Scott&#39;s state Department of Economic Opportunity would not confirm whether that is the case, saying only that Deutsche Bank had not yet received any money for the project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s normal, however. State incentives typically are offered on jobs that are actually created, not just promised.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s absolutely worth the investment,&quot; said state Rep. Daniel Davis, a Republican who leads the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. &quot;You have a little investment up front to invest in the long haul.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA Deutsche Bank spokesman downplayed the role of incentives in the company&rsquo;s decision, saying &quot;there were numerous factors that led to this announcement of new jobs at our Jacksonville location.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe are not evaluating whether Deutsche Bank finds several things about Florida attractive for expanding its company: the weather, the lack of income tax, etc. We are looking at Scott&rsquo;s response to a pointed question in his Fox News interview: Did Florida offer &quot;something special&quot; to Deutsche Bank in exchange for 300 jobs?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tScott could have acknowledged that economic incentives were used in the deal. Instead he said they were not.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&#39;s incorrect.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRecords show the company is ready to receive up to $2.08 million in state and local incentives if it hits its job targets. We rate Scott&#39;s claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-25T15:11:57.061734", "ruling_date": "2013-06-25T16:12:49", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
