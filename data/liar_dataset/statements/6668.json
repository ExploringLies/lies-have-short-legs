The president claimed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, &quot;want to turn Medicare into a voucher system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust as in that fact-check, Chivukula&rsquo;s claim is mostly on solid ground.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Medicare proposal backed by Romney and Ryan would provide &quot;premium support&quot; payments to future beneficiaries to purchase health insurance. There are some distinctions between the two terms, but the word &quot;voucher&quot; generally describes this approach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChivukula told us &quot;voucher&quot; is an appropriate way of describing the proposal, adding that the system would force beneficiaries to shop around for coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain how the plan works.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the traditional Medicare program, which is available to anyone 65 or older, the government pays health care providers directly for services. Beneficiaries must bear the cost of deductibles and co-insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan, a Wisconsin congressman, has been the chief architect of a proposal to dramatically restructure Medicare. Romney has said his and Ryan&rsquo;s Medicare plans are the &quot;same if not identical -- it&rsquo;s probably close to identical.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe latest version of Ryan&rsquo;s plan was approved in March by the GOP-controlled House as part of a budget resolution, but it was later rejected by the Democrat-led Senate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe plan would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries and individuals who become eligible before 2023. But starting in 2023, newly eligible beneficiaries would receive a premium support payment to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The payments would either pay for or offset the cost of health care premiums.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a report accompanying their budget resolution, House Republicans argued the proposal was not about providing vouchers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is not a voucher program; a Medicare premium-support payment would be paid, by Medicare, directly to the plan or the fee-for-service program to subsidize its cost,&quot; according to the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the claims by Obama and Chivukula raised the same question: Is it reasonable to refer to premium support payments as vouchers?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs our PolitiFact colleagues noted, there are distinctions between the two terms, dealing with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed. Ryan&rsquo;s most recent plan more closely reflects a pure premium support, but substantively, it&rsquo;s somewhere between the two approaches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHenry Aaron, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank, told PolitiFact National &quot;that premium support is a type of voucher.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Robert Moffit, a health policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact National that the Obama campaign&rsquo;s use of the term &quot;voucher&quot; is not justified, since the Ryan plan includes more regulation than for, say, airline vouchers for food and drink.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a TV interview, Chivukula claimed Republicans &quot;have declared that they&rsquo;re going to convert the Medicare program into a voucher program.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStarting in 2023, the Republicans&rsquo; plan would provide premium support payments for new beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.
