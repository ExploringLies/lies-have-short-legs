On the image, two columns were circled in red -- two columns of sub-results by age group for a question about how favorably or unfavorably the respondent views Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two columns show responses for survey participants ages 18 to 34 and ages 35 to 49. Every possible answer in those columns has been marked N/A -- &quot;not applicable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The creator of the image was dumbfounded, slapping this comment on the image in big red type: &quot;CNN&#39;s Crap Polling: No one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reader who contacted PolitiFact wondered whether the image creator&rsquo;s question was legitimate, so we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: It&rsquo;s all a misunderstanding about how CNN reports the results of its surveys. (After we emailed questions to the person who had posted it on their Facebook page, we didn&rsquo;t receive a response, but the post was pulled down. We saved a screenshot, above.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to debunk the graphic&rsquo;s assumption is to look a few columns to the right. There, one can find a heading that reads &quot;under 50,&quot; with 74 percent of respondents in that age group saying they feel favorably about Clinton, 23 percent saying they feel unfavorably, 3 percent saying they have no opinion and 1 percent saying they&rsquo;ve never heard of her. (Our real question: Who belongs to the 1 percent who have never heard of Hillary Clinton?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this column of poll results clearly shows that people under 50 did tell the survey takers about their opinions about Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about those mysterious columns full of &quot;N/A&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are there because of CNN&rsquo;s polling policy. The policy is explained fully in the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/19/politics/cnn-orc-poll-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/index.html\">same document</a> that the Facebook image was drawn from, though it appears on an earlier page not shown in the Facebook post. This section explains the CNN policy on &quot;crosstabs&quot; -- the polling industry&rsquo;s term for results sorted by demographic subcategories such as age, race, gender or income level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Crosstabs on the following pages only include results for subgroups with enough unweighted cases to produce a sampling error of +/- 8.5 percentage points or less,&quot; CNN wrote. &quot;Some subgroups represent too small a share of the national population to produce crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. Interviews were conducted among these subgroups, but results for groups with a sampling error larger than +/-8.5 percentage points are not displayed and instead are denoted with &lsquo;N/A.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, for the age ranges 18 to 34 and 35 to 49, the survey reached too few people to produce a statistically valid sample -- so to avoid publishing questionable numbers, CNN simply reported them as &quot;N/A.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This pattern -- categories with larger sample sizes given specific figures, and those with smaller sample size&nbsp;marked &quot;N/A&quot; -- is echoed elsewhere in the full document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The CNN/ORC polls are highly regarded,&quot; said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;They are one of the few partnerships to provide us subgroup data, which is invaluable. The Facebook question does a disservice to the poll.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet graphic accused CNN of being such an incompetent pollster that it found that &quot;no one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is based on a misreading of the CNN-sponsored poll. Two age-range subcategories produced too few respondents to qualify as statistically valid results under CNN&rsquo;s threshold, which was plainly spelled out in the survey-results document. The claim is even debunked on the graphic itself -- it showed a category with actual results for respondents under the age of 50. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script src=\"http://www.politifact.com/media/js/politifactwidget5.js\"></script></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-21T15:12:50.203661", "ruling_date": "2015-10-21T16:00:15", "ruling_headline": "In next chapter of Sanders-Clinton conspiracy theory, graphic takes aim at CNN's polling operation", "ruling_headline_slug": "next-chapter-conspiracy-theiry-graphic-takes-aim-c", "ruling_link_text": "Graphic debunks itself", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Internet graphic submitted by a reader to PolitiFact, Oct. 21, 2015 (subsequently taken down from Facebook)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/19/politics/cnn-orc-poll-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democratic-debate/index.html\">Full results: Post-Democratic debate</a>,&quot;
