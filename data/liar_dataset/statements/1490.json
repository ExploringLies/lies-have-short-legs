Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, told supporters that spending in Washington is out of control.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst spiced his Tuesday e-mail with a reference to the Democratic House speaker, stating that &quot;during the recent global warming summit in Copenhagen, Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel on a trip costing nearly $10,000 per person.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe House speaker living large in Denmark? We checked into that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst&rsquo;s campaign pointed us to a USA Today post online reflecting on a report by CBS News, which reviewed travel vouchers filed by Pelosi&rsquo;s office after the international climate summit in December. A summary of the travel vouchers filed by Pelosi&rsquo;s office states that air fare, food and lodging costs for 57 people including Pelosi added up to $553,564. That works out to $9,711 per person.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCBS found that a factor in the travel costs was that the host hotel, a five-star Marriott, required guests to pay for six nights&rsquo; stay even if they were staying two nights, as Pelosi did. CBS also said that in fairness, &quot;many attendees told us they did a lot of hard work, and laid the groundwork for a future global treaty.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPelosi&#39;s food and lodging expenses totaled $4,406 (she, like many, took a military jet to the summit). She declined to discuss the trip costs, CBS said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPelosi personally accounted for less than 10 percent of the costs reported by her office for dozens of individuals. Still, Dewhurst correctly summarized the overall per-person travel costs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Dewhurst&rsquo;s statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-17T13:38:19.091527", "ruling_date": "2010-02-17T16:50:15", "ruling_headline": "Lt.
