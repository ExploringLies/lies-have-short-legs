Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.), and whip up an air of illicit love and it&rsquo;s not hard to assemble clickbait gold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can suspend all common sense, that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website Freedomcrossroads.us -- topped by a patriotic flag, a bald eagle, and the motto, &quot;AMERICA -- LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!&quot; -- recently ran an <a href=\"http://freedomcrossroads.us/james-comey-affair-revealed/\">article headlined</a>, &quot;BREAKING: The Democrat James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With Was JUST REVEALED! (DETAILS).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article posits that the website has uncovered an affair lasting at least eight months between Comey and Wasserman Schultz. (For the record, both are married.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get quickly to the bottom line: This allegation is complete and utter hooey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are fact-checking it because Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to fight fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of July 7, 2017, the post had been shared 2,200 times. A <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-james-comey-reveals-the-democrat-hes-been-having-an-affair-with-details/\">reprinted version</a> at a separate site, thelastlineofdefense.org, prompted additional shares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comey&rsquo;s paramour, according to the article, is &quot;none other than the DISGRACED former Chair of the DNC, Debbie &quot;Whiny Democrat&quot; Wasserman Schultz &mdash; talk about a match made in Heave&hellip; errrrr&hellip; Hell! These two dimwits were probably attracted to each other because they are both LOSERS who can&rsquo;t accept defeat, but that doesn&rsquo;t really differentiate them from the rest of the crybaby Democrat Party, now does it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website cites &quot;our exclusive sources&quot; to support the idea that the two &quot;couldn&rsquo;t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair. Not exactly shocking, considering they&rsquo;re two liberal sickos &mdash; and we all know, ANYTHING goes for them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article suggests that Comey&rsquo;s criticism of Trump, the man who fired him, stems from a desire to &quot;impress his GIRLFRIEND. Pathetic.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither Comey&rsquo;s nor Wasserman Schultz&rsquo;s camp commented for this article, but debunking this item is straightforward: Freedomcrossroads.us is a self-styled parody site that operates for clicks that earn advertising money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its modus operandi is to troll social media users susceptible to believing overheated conservative rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the <a href=\"http://freedomcrossroads.us/\">bottom of the home page</a>, the site says, &quot;We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won&rsquo;t find any of it here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On another page, the site <a href=\"http://freedomcrossroads.us/sample-page/\">informs readers</a>, &quot;Freedom Crossroads is a magical place where patriots and God-fearing, Trump-loving Americans can go to find like-minded friends, read all about the buzz in the conservative community and be a part of the revolution to make America great again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site, it says, &quot;uses facts that don&rsquo;t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here. All of our articles are basically a crock of doody and should be considered satirical whimsies for today&rsquo;s aging conservative. All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such disclaimers, however, are nowhere to be found on the actual article page, which makes it easy for some readers to miss the joke.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Freedomcrossroads.us published an article that said &quot;James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With&quot; Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
