Under past administrations, the border didn&rsquo;t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing. Down 78 percent,&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/07/28/remarks-president-trump-law-enforcement-officials-ms-13\">said</a> in New York on July 28. &quot;And, in fact, the southern border of Mexico, we did them a big favor -- believe me.&nbsp;They get very little traffic in there anymore, because they know they&#39;re not going to get through the border to the United States. So that whole group has been incredible, led by General (John) Kelly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump congratulated Kelly for doing &quot;an incredible job&quot; as secretary of Homeland Security, and at a July&nbsp;31 Cabinet meeting &mdash; the first for Kelly as Trump&#39;s new chief of staff &mdash; reiterated his pride for reductions in illegal immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you know, the border was a tremendous problem, and they&rsquo;re close to 80 percent stoppage. &nbsp;And even the president of Mexico called me &mdash; they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they&rsquo;re not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment,&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/07/31/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting\">said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/10/donald-trump/trump-illegal-immigration-down-64-percent-march-tr/\">past </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/25/donald-trump/illegal-immigration-lowest-17-years-trump-said/\">statements</a> Trump has made, his remarks that &quot;the border is down 78 percent&quot; refer to apprehensions of immigrants trying to enter the country illegally. But calculations of different time periods do not show a 78 percent decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim that under past administrations apprehensions did not go down is not accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&lsquo;The border is down 78 percent&rsquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump uses different timeframes to make a case that illegal immigration is down. He has looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there&rsquo;s been a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/10/donald-trump/trump-illegal-immigration-down-64-percent-march-tr/\">64 percent</a> decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016, to say it&rsquo;s gone down <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/22/donald-trump/trump-says-illegal-immigration-down-61-percent-ele/\">61 percent</a>; and said there was a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/14/donald-trump/trump-says-after-executive-orders-illegal-immigrat/\">40 percent</a> decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where does the 78 percent come from? We asked the White House but did not get a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From June 2016 to June 2017, apprehensions at the southwest border went down <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/07/07/statement-secretary-johnson-southwest-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement\">53 percent</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration\">data</a> also show that from November to June (latest available figures), apprehensions by border patrol agents declined about 66 percent. From January to June, it declined 49 percent. From Trump&rsquo;s first full month in office, February, to June, it went down 14 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And though they remain low, &nbsp;the number of apprehensions actually picked up in May and in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Fact Checker <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/01/president-trumps-claim-that-illegal-immigration-went-up-under-past-administrations/\">noted</a>, Trump&rsquo;s claim of apprehensions nearing 80 percent is clearer when comparing cherry-picked figures: the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). That yields a 76.4 percent decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&lsquo;The border didn&rsquo;t go down, it went up&rsquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also claimed, &quot;Under past administrations, the border didn&rsquo;t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, apprehensions have gone down under past administrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unauthorized immigration also fell dramatically during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyses of monthly and annual apprehension statistics show declines for both Bush and Obama&rsquo;s administrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No matter how you look at it, Trump is far from the first U.S. president to preside over big drops in unauthorized immigration,&quot; Wilson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apprehension rates at the southern border have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/03/john-conyers/apprehensions/\">plummeted</a> since the 1980s. In 1986 there were <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Oct/BP%20Southwest%20Border%20Sector%20Apps%20FY1960%20-%20FY2016.pdf\">1.6 million apprehensions</a> &ndash; about 1.2 million more than in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decline hasn&rsquo;t been as steady, however, as there have been increases and decreases over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1980s, there was an annual average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org also <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/trumps-border-boast/\">pointed out</a> that apprehensions declined 75 percent from fiscal years 2000 to 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Referring to border apprehensions, Trump said, &quot;The border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn&rsquo;t go down, it went up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calculations of the latest figures available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection do not show a 78 percent decline in apprehensions. The closest number to that would be based on cherry-picked numbers of the highest number of apprehensions in November to the lowest number, in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though there have been fluctuations over the years in the number of apprehensions, they certainly have gone down under past administrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-02T17:43:43.774193", "ruling_date": "2017-08-03T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "False: Trump's claim about illegal immigration under past administrations", "ruling_headline_slug": "false-trumps-claim-about-illegal-immigration-under", "ruling_link_text": "Apprehensions have gone down before", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/07/28/remarks-president-trump-law-enforcement-officials-ms-13\">Remarks by President Trump to Law Enforcement Officials on MS-13</a>, July 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/07/31/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting\">Remarks by President Trump in Cabinet Meeting</a>, July 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United States Border Patrol, <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Oct/BP%20Southwest%20Border%20Sector%20Apps%20FY1960%20-%20FY2016.pdf\">Southwest border apprehension data from fiscal years 1960 to 2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Department of Homeland Security, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/07/07/statement-secretary-johnson-southwest-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement\">Archived Content: Statement by Secretary Jeh C.
