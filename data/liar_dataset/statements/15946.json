The actual shirt that he was holding said &quot;Hate Won&rsquo;t Win.&quot; That text was typed at the center of two hands creating the heart symbol. (Michelle Obama is making the same sign.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweet also said, &quot;So inspired by the grace shown by the Simmons family and all the victims&#39; families in Charleston. #HateWontWin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Obama post came days after a deadly mass shooting by a white supremacist at a predominantly black church in Charleston, S.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A movement called &quot;Hate Won&rsquo;t Win&quot; emerged after the shooting, to &quot;create a more culturally cohesive society that appreciates and celebrates differences instead of allowing them to divide us.&quot; It encouraged people to show &quot;an act of love to someone of a different race, religion, economic class, age, etc. by posting a picture or video to your social media page with the hashtag, #hatewontwin&quot; and to challenge others to do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, names of democrats have been floated around speculating whether they would run against President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michelle Obama has shut down any speculation that she might run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to be president.
