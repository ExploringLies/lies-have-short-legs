Abbott&rsquo;s list shows 311 accusations of election fraud spanning 2002-12. The 57 investigations we&rsquo;re checking represent only those cases that were both prosecuted and resolved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSix of the prosecutions ended in dismissal or acquittal, Strickland told us by telephone, leaving 51 prosecutions that resulted in convictions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy our analysis, three-quarters of the cases involved election code violations classified as &quot;illegal voting&quot; -- which <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/EL/htm/EL.64.htm\">includes</a> acts such as voting more than once, impersonating a voter or voting despite ineligibility -- and &quot;method of returning marked ballot,&quot; often meaning the defendant was accused of having someone else&rsquo;s ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly two cases are described as &quot;voter impersonation&quot; on the list. Whether voter impersonation is a standing problem has been a hot button in the state&rsquo;s legislative debates over proposed voter ID laws in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw_YozAeP6A7766moY0OJN5n5HnzWSXgfpqlpdb6kig/edit\"><em>Austin American-Statesman</em> news stories</a> say legislators mostly split along party lines, with Democrats claiming impersonation is rare and Republicans claiming the problem is significant. Abbott drew criticism in 2006 for creating a special unit to target voter fraud that by mid-2008 had yielded, according to a May 19, 2008, Associated Press <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw_YozAeP6A7766moY0OJN5n5HnzWSXgfpqlpdb6kig/edit\">news story</a>, only 26 prosecutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking at all 57 election fraud prosecutions from 2002 to 2012, we tallied up the resolutions (some had multiple outcomes, when charges were pursued as separate cases):</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSpecified as convictions: 26</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tGuilty plea resulting in conviction: 2</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDeferred adjudication: 19</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPre-trial diversion: 10</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAcquitted: 2</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDismissed: 4</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor clarification of the middle two categories, we turned to the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, an Austin-based nonprofit that provides continuing legal education and technical assistance to prosecutors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group&rsquo;s executive director, Rob Kepple, told us in an interview that although deferred adjudication falls short of a conviction, he would not consider it a stretch to classify it with the convictions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn deferred adjudication, Kepple said, the defendant pleads guilty, and then &quot;the court defers any finding of guilt and places you on probation or community supervision.&quot; If the terms are met, the case is dismissed -- but it remains on the defendant&rsquo;s record, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis means it can carry the weight of a conviction in later cases, Kepple said. For example, if a person is given deferred adjudication in a domestic violence case and then later is charged again with domestic violence, he said, the adjudication counts as the first offense, making the new charge a second offense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a pre-trial diversion is not a conviction, he said. There&rsquo;s not even necessarily a guilty plea or admission of guilt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Basically, they sat down with the defendant and say, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen. You agree not to mess up for 12 months and we&rsquo;ll just dismiss the case.&rsquo; So in no common parlance can this be considered a conviction,&quot; Kepple said. The case can even be expunged from the defendant&rsquo;s record, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&rsquo;s no way you can mistake a pre-trial diversion for a conviction, I don&rsquo;t think.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also consulted the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, a group that provides support and education for its members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike Kepple, the association&rsquo;s capital assistance attorney, Rick Wardroup, pointed out via email that the final outcome of a pre-trial diversion or deferred adjudication depends on whether the defendant meets the terms of their probation or supervision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by telephone that the attorney general counts pre-trial diversions as a successful outcome for two main reasons: First, although the defendants do not plead guilty, such agreements are made in order to avoid an expected criminal trial, and second, because the defendant receives a punishment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter we shared our findings with her, Bean sent us another bit of backup: a <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/LG/htm/LG.133.htm#133.101\">section</a> of Texas local government code on court costs that classes deferred adjudication and pre-trial diversions with convictions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Texas law school assistant professor Jennifer Laurin told us via email that clauses like this in state laws indicate the reverse -- they illustrate that these two outcomes are not normally considered convictions. And Kepple said, &quot;That section is the definition of &lsquo;conviction&rsquo; for the purpose of collecting fines and fees. But in common parlance, a deferred prosecution and deferred adjudications simply are not criminal convictions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbbott&rsquo;s statement refers to 50 &quot;convictions,&quot; which he might better have termed &quot;satisfactory results.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt looks to us like 60 percent of his cited &quot;convictions&quot; were not convictions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe recognize, though, that our analysis presumes that all the non-convicted defendants fulfilled or will fulfill all terms of the agreements they made to avoid going to trial. That may not be so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn balance, we rate Abbott&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-16T10:36:28.032017", "ruling_date": "2012-04-17T15:38:20", "ruling_headline": "Greg Abbott claims 50 election fraud convictions since 2002", "ruling_headline_slug": "greg-abbott-claims-50-election-fraud-convictions-2", "ruling_link_text": "29 cases fall short", "ruling_state": "Texas", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTelephone and email interviews with Jerry Strickland, communications director for Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, March 13-April 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone and email interviews with Lauren Bean, deputy communications director for Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, April 9-16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Jennifer Laurin, assistant professor at University of Texas School of Law, April 12-16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail and in-person interviews with Rob Kepple, executive director of Texas District and County Attorneys Association, April 11-16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interviews with Rick Wardroup, capital assistance attorney for Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, April 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> news story, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw_YozAeP6A7766moY0OJN5n5HnzWSXgfpqlpdb6kig/edit\">&quot;ID plan puts spotlight on voter fraud,&quot;</a> May 23, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press news story, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw_YozAeP6A7766moY0OJN5n5HnzWSXgfpqlpdb6kig/edit\">&quot;Abbott&#39;s vote fraud effort yields no GOP prosecutions,&quot;</a> May 19, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> news story, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw_YozAeP6A7766moY0OJN5n5HnzWSXgfpqlpdb6kig/edit\">&quot;Voter ID back in spotlight,&quot;</a> March 9, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> news story, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw_YozAeP6A7766moY0OJN5n5HnzWSXgfpqlpdb6kig/edit\">&quot;Feds say no to Texas&#39; law requiring voter ID,&quot;</a> March 13, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "governor", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Greg", "half_true_count": 9, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 409, "last_name": "Abbott", "mostly_true_count": 9, "name_slug": "greg-abbott", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/abbottmugnew16pft.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/409/", "total_count": 56, "true_count": 12, "website": "http://gregabbott.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays his Texas election fraud investigations have resulted in 50 convictions.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press release", "statement_date": "2012-03-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
