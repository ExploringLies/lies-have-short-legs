Well, PolitiFact Oregon addressed it more than a year ago when Scott Bruun tried to use it against Rep. Kurt Schrader and called the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/oct/02/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-says-kurt-schrader-cut-500-billion-med/\">Mostly False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s not all: PolitiFact National gave Michele Bachmann a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/michele-bachmann/did-president-obama-steal-500-billion-medicare/\">Mostly False</a> in September for claiming Obama was stealing $500 billion from Medicare. In July, PolitiFact Texas gave a state representative a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/jul/17/lois-kolkhorst/lois-kolkhorst-says-obama-administration-cutting-m/\">Mostly False</a> for claiming $500 billion in Medicare cuts were coming. And PolitiFact Ohio served up an out-and-out <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jun/23/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-claims-sen-sherrod-brown-voted-cut-500-billio/\">False</a> to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in June for claiming that Sen. Sherrod Brown had voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are more, but you probably get the idea.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNaturally, we were a little surprised, then, when Rob Cornilles, the Republican candidate for the open 1st congressional district seat, accused state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici, his Democratic opponent, of supporting a $500 billion cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd yet, there it was, during a speech he delivered Wednesday: &quot;Senator Bonamici says she supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s a small bit of truth here. The Affordable Care Act does reduce Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But here&rsquo;s the catch: Those dollars aren&rsquo;t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $500 billion is all in future spending reductions and come through the law&rsquo;s attempts to slow projected growth, not cut spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National has highlighted the biggest bits of savings: About $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in Medicare payments to health care providers. Another $36 billion comes from increasing premiums for higher-income beneficiaries. Administrative changes land another $12 billion in savings. A new national board is set to come up with $15.5 billion in savings -- but can&rsquo;t get those savings from a reduction in benefits. The last big chunk of $136 billion comes in changes to the Medicare Advantage program, which has become more expensive than initially anticipated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, given all these changes, Medicare spending is expected to increase -- something we pointed out in our fact check on Bruun a year ago. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we said last year, while it&rsquo;s true that the government is looking to reduce the growth of future spending, the Affordable Care Act does not eliminate $500 billion out of the current budget for Medicare. Most important, there are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to do two things before we gave a final ruling on the subject.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst up, we called Bonamici&rsquo;s campaign to make sure she even supports the Affordable Care Act. She confirmed that, while she doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s perfect, had she been in office when the final vote was taken, she would have been a &quot;yes.&quot; In a statement she added, &quot;Let me be absolutely clear: I do not support cutting Medicare benefits. I believe Medicare is a fundamental promise our nation owes to seniors and keeping Medicare financially stable is simply a matter of getting our priorities straight.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, we gave a call to Cornilles&rsquo; campaign to see if it still felt his statement was truthful. Mary Anne Ostrom, his campaign manager, said the campaign stood by the comment. She pointed to an <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/07/health_care_reform_could_cut_m.html\">Oregonian article</a> before the health care bill passed that described the proposed savings as &quot;cuts&quot; (which it does, but it doesn&rsquo;t make the claim any more accurate) and to a Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-gop-debate-500-billion-in-cuts-to-medicare/2011/06/14/AGsnGAVH_blog.html\">Fact Checker article</a> that she said backed them up -- at least to some degree.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA quick read through that article, and we come to the same point: &quot;The health care bill tries to identify ways to save money, and so the $500 billion figure comes from the difference over 10 years between anticipated Medicare spending (what is known as &lsquo;the baseline&rsquo;) and the changes the law makes to reduce spending.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe author also noted -- and it&rsquo;s worth repeating here -- that Republican leaders have supported the same cuts. &quot;In the House Republican budget, lawmakers repealed the Obama health care law but retained all but $10 billion of the nearly $500 billion in Medicare savings, suggesting the actual policies enacted to achieve these spending reductions were not that objectionable to GOP lawmakers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, even the Washington Post story that Cornilles claims as support found the claim to have &quot;significant omissions and/or exaggerations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe pointed that out to Ostrom, who simply said the campaign didn&rsquo;t agree with our interpretation -- or the previous PolitiFact interpretations for that matter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings us to our ruling. Generally, we&rsquo;d give this a &quot;Mostly False&quot; given that there is a small kernel of truth to the statement. But we also have a policy of taking into account whether the speaker is willfully repeating something we&rsquo;ve said wasn&rsquo;t true before -- and in this case we have said it several times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that reason, we&rsquo;re giving Cornilles a False for his statement that Bonamici supports $500 billion in cuts to Medicare.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/11/does_bonamici_really_support_b.html\">Comment on the ruling at OregonLive</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-10T18:34:08.999431", "ruling_date": "2011-11-14T15:55:56", "ruling_headline": "Another look at a favorite Republican talking point", "ruling_headline_slug": "another-look-favorite-republican-talking-point", "ruling_link_text": "It's false, no matter how many times you say it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRob Cornilles, speech, Nov. 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatement from Suzanne Bonamici, Nov. 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/20/60-plus-association/medicare-cuts-health-care-law-will-hurt-seniors-sa/\">Medicare &#39;cuts&#39; in the health care law will hurt seniors, says 60 Plus Association</a>,&quot; Sept. 20 2010<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe Kaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kaiseredu.org/tutorials/Medicare-and-health-reform/player.html\">Health Reform and Medicare: Overview of Key Provisions</a>,&quot; July 2010<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/14/barack-obama/obama-claims-medicare-benefits-will-not-be-cut-und/\">Obama claims Medicare benefits will not be cut under the health care bill</a>,&quot; Aug.t 14, 2009<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/oct/02/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-says-kurt-schrader-cut-500-billion-med/\">Scott Bruun says Kurt Schrader cut $500 billion from Medicare, hurting seniors</a>,&quot; Oct. 2, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jun/23/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-claims-sen-sherrod-brown-voted-cut-500-billio/\">NRSC claims Sen.
