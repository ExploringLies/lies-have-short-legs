At a town hall event in Berea, Ohio, Sen. Barack Obama brought up the subject again, knocking Sen. John McCain for mocking him for advocating proper tire inflation. <p>\r\n\"The Republicans are going around -- this is the kind of thing they do, I don't understand it -- they're going around, they're sending, like, little tire gauges, making fun of this idea, as if this is Barack Obama's energy plan,\" Obama said in the August 5 appearance. \"Now, two points: One, they know they're lying about what my energy plan is. But the other thing is they're making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent.\"  <p>\r\nWe've decided to check that last sentence, which the McCain campaign and <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/08/tire_pressure_1.asp\">a conservative blog</a> brought to our attention.\r\nWe found that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/608/\">Obama was correct</a> in a prior claim along these lines, when he suggested that inflating tires properly and getting tune-ups could \"save all the oil\" we could get from drilling in protected areas offshore. <p>\r\n(The McCain campaign and its allies in the conservative blogosphere have attacked that finding from every angle, but we stand by it.) <p>\r\nBut this new claim is different. This time Obama didn't talk about what tire inflation and tune-ups \"could\" do. He said \"every expert\" was in agreement that tire inflation \"would absolutely reduce our oil consumption\" by 3 to 4 percent. <p>\r\nWe imagine very few experts would say that. <p> \r\n\"You can make some back of the envelope calculations to show that number would be impossible to obtain,\" said Thomas Menzies, a senior program officer at the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies who managed and drafted a study on tires and fuel economy.\r\nSo let's do that. <p>\r\nTo support the claim, Obama's campaign referred us to <a href=\" http://www1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/tips/pdfs/energy_savers.pdf\">this brochure</a> from the U.S. Department of Energy. On page 31 it says: \"Keep tires properly inflated and aligned to improve your gasoline mileage by around 3.3 percent.\"  <p>\r\nSimilarly, <a href=\"http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml\">this Department of Energy Web page</a> says: \"You can improve your gas mileage by around 3.3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0.4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires.\" <p>\r\nUnder-inflation is a severe problem (affecting 80 out of 81 cars according to <a href-\"http://finance.yahoo.com/family-home/article/104865/The-15-Minute-Tip-Err-on-the-Side-of-More-Air\">one survey</a>), but most tires do not suffer from severe under-inflation. <p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/TPMS-FMVSS-No138-2005/part3.html#5\">This survey</a> by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that 26 percent of passenger vehicles had at least one tire under-inflated by 25 percent or more, and the average under-inflation of the four tires for those vehicles (not each tire) was 6.8 pounds per square inch. <p>\r\nSo if those drivers corrected their tire pressure, their fuel consumption would be 2.7 percent (6.8 x .4) better. That's just the severe under-inflators -- savings would be smaller for the rest of us. So fuel consumption would fall by something less than 2.7 percent if passenger vehicles corrected their tire pressure.  <p>\r\nFurthermore, those savings alone would not result in a one-to-one reduction in oil consumption, as Obama suggested, since just 70 percent of the oil we consume goes to vehicles. The rest gets used in a vast array of products from petroleum jelly to fertilizer. <p>\r\nAlso, commercial vehicles have less of a problem with under-inflation, because truckers check their tire pressure religiously to minimize fuel consumption. So they would further drag down the average savings from correcting tire pressure. <p>\r\nObama's prior claim on this subject was safely couched in generalities and possibilities. But this time he veered into certainties and absolutes -- \"every expert,\" \"would absolutely\" -- put an exact number on fuel savings, and linked it to overall oil consumption in a way that did not stand up to scrutiny. We find his claim to be False.", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:07.890890", "ruling_date": "2008-08-08T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Obama inflates this tire claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-inflates-this-tire-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Obama inflates this tire claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "PolitiFact.com,\n<a href=\" http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/608/\">\n Not overinflated (though it sounds like it)\n</a>\n<p>\n WeeklyStandard.com, The Blog,\n <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/08/tire_pressure_1.asp\">\n  Tire Inflation Could Not Save More Oil Than Offshore Drilling Could Produce\n </a>\n August 6, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n YouTube.com,\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akjXqfvLu28\">\n  Obama Insists Inflating Tires Better Than Oil Drilling\n </a>\n , August 5, 2008, accessed August 7, 2008.\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Department of Energy,\n <a hef=\"http://www1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/tips/pdfs/energy_savers.pdf\">\n  Energy Saver$\n </a>\n , January 2006\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Department of Energy,\n <a href=\"http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml\">\n  Keeping Your Car In Shape\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n National Highway Transportation Safety Administration,\n <a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/TPMS-FMVSS-No138-2005/part3.html#5\">\n  Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, Tire Pressure Monitoring System\n </a>\n , March, 2005\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with Thomas Menzies, Senior Program Officer for the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, August 7, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Yahoo Finance,\n <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/family-home/article/104865/The-15-Minute-Tip-Err-on-the-Side-of-More-Air\">\n  The 15-Minute Tip: Err on the Side of More Air\n </a>\n April 18, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "Fully inflating tires is \"a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent.\"", "statement_context": "a town hall in Berea, Ohio.", "statement_date": "2008-08-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
