David N. Cicilline, was criticized for leaving the city in poor financial shape and draining reserve funds to balance his last city budget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCicilline denied that he had masked an emerging financial crisis in Providence and he defended his accomplishments during his eight years as mayor, saying that, &quot;When I took office in 2003, we had very little reserves, and we worked very hard to build up our reserves.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe decided to take a look. We began by asking Cicilline&rsquo;s communications director, Jessica Kershaw, to provide the basis for the former mayor&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn reply, Cicilline&rsquo;s congressional office issued a statement saying: &quot;When referring to the unreserved fund balance, or rainy day fund, as the attached Comprehensive Annual Financial Report shows, in 2003, when Cicilline took office as mayor, there was $10 million, and the Cicilline administration more than doubled that by building it up to $22 million by 2008.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAttached to the statement was a page from the city&rsquo;s audited financial statement for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010. That page shows Providence had an &quot;unreserved&quot; general fund balance of $10.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2003. That total rose to a high of $22.36 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, but it plunged to $2.08 million at the end of fiscal year 2010.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo does $10.2 million represent &quot;very little reserves&quot;? Well, at that time $10.2 million was just under 3 percent of the city&rsquo;s $345 million in actual general operating spending for 2003.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertainly, that&rsquo;s not nearly as much as the $22.36 million in unreserved fund balance that the Cicilline administration had accumulated by fiscal year 2008 -- about 5 percent of the city&rsquo;s actual spending that year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it&rsquo;s a whole lot more than the $2.08 million that the Cicilline administration had left by the end of fiscal year 2010 -- about 0.5 percent of the actual spending.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd it looks really good in comparison with the $220,814 that remained in those reserves as of March 11.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut what is the standard for determining whether a city&rsquo;s rainy day fund is sufficient? Public finance literature often focuses on a 5 percent standard. And this year, the Government Finance Officers Association executive board is recommending revised &quot;best practices&quot; that call for the equivalent of two months -- or 16.6 percent -- of annual spending.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith that in mind, did Cicilline have &quot;very little reserves&quot; when he had $10.2 million, or about 3 percent?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGary S. Sasse, the former Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council director and state revenue director who is now financial adviser to the Providence City Council, said, &quot;I would say 3 percent is marginal reserves. It doesn&rsquo;t meet the requirement of 5 percent. But it&rsquo;s better than nothing. It&rsquo;s better than we have right now.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCity Treasurer James J. Lombardi III, a critic of Cicilline&rsquo;s financial practices, said that while the 2003 unreserved fund balance fell below &nbsp;the 5 percent threshold, that doesn&rsquo;t mean Providence had &quot;very little&quot; reserves at the time. &quot;Clearly, it was a lot more than we have today,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlus, the Cicilline administration had other restricted contingency accounts as a cushion, Lombardi said. And in 2003, the city&rsquo;s assets included the Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts Center, which it later sold. Now, the city has slashed its unreserved general fund balance, depleted restricted contingency accounts and borrowed at least $60 million to balance the budget, he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCicilline has defended his decision to use reserve funds and to borrow money to balance budgets, saying those actions were better than cutting city services and significantly raising taxes. &quot;It was a judgment that I made that that was the best way to navigate through the worst economy since the Great Depression,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo where does that leave us?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertainly, it&rsquo;s true that when Cicilline took office, the unreserved fund balance did not meet the often-cited 5 percent threshold and it fell well short of the 16.6-percent goal that a professional group now recommends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it&rsquo;s a stretch for the former mayor to characterize the $10.2 million he had in 2003 &nbsp;as &quot;very little.&quot; After all, that&rsquo;s almost five times what was in the reserve fund in his last year in office.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven municipal finance standards, there is an element of truth in Cicilline&rsquo;s claim, but his statement ignores critical facts that would give a much different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that is the definition of &quot;Barely True.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>Editor&#39;s note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
