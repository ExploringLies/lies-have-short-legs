Scott Walker proposed making state employees pay more for health and pension benefits, one of his aides <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.mobi/more/news/politics/115911379.htm\">said</a> the changes would cost the average worker roughly 8 percent of his or her salary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWalker&rsquo;s move so angered MSNBC-TV talk show host Ed Schultz that he came to Madison on Feb. 17, 2011 -- the day the Legislature was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116381289.html\">scheduled to </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116381289.html\">vote</a> on the proposals -- to air his show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo days earlier, Schultz claimed on <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30031533/\">&quot;The Ed Show&quot;</a> the impact on state workers would be much greater than 8 percent. He <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/41635183#41613096\">said</a>:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;People who earn $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSchultz hedged a bit by saying might. But the implication was the effect of Walker&rsquo;s proposals would be to cut the income of large numbers of state workers by 20 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s see if he&rsquo;s right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSchultz said in the broadcast that he had been given figures that show a 20 percent impact. We asked his staff for that information and they said they would attempt to provide it. &nbsp;But as of publication, we have not heard from them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the Republican governor&rsquo;s plan, state employees would contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward pensions and pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, we consulted other sources on how much more state workers would pay if the budget repair <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf\">bill</a> is adopted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s a political debate, but this is largely a mathematical question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s what our sources said:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration: The higher contributions would amount to, on average, a 9.4 percent cut in take-home pay.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.joewineke.com/meet-joe/\">Joe Wineke</a>, former administrator of the state Division of Compensation and Labor Relations and former chairman of the state Democratic Party: The impact on most workers would be 6.8 percent to 11 percent of their salary.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie: Detailed estimates are being prepared, but the cost to the average worker would be about 8 percent of their wages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Chancellor Brian Levin-Stankevich: In a <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/Repair+Bill+Chancellor+e-mail+2-1-112.docx\">memo</a>, he said a UW-Eau Claire employee who earns $40,000 per year would pay an annual pension contribution of $2,320, up from $80; and an annual health insurance premium for family coverage of $2,820, up from $1,068. That&rsquo;s a total of $3,992 per year, or 12.9 percent of that employee&rsquo;s salary.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the plan, all employees would pay the same percentage of their income toward pensions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the larger health insurance payments would eat up a higher percentage of the income of low-income employees than of high-income employees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo the total impact would vary on a percentage basis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat said, the total impact, in terms of a percentage of income, would not vary widely, according to Wineke. The vast majority of state employees take the same so-called Tier 1 health coverage, he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s return to the statement:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSchultz said Wisconsin state employees earning $30,000 to $50,000 per year &quot;might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight&quot; as a result of Walker&rsquo;s proposals to boost state employee payments for health and pension benefits. It was a broad statement about the impact of the measures. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sources we consulted indicate the range is 6.8 percent to 11 percent. Even if the higher payments comprise 20 percent of the income of some employees, there&rsquo;s no indication it will be that high on a wide scale, particularly for state workers earning as much as $50,000 per year. If Schultz can provide evidence of a large-scale 20 percent impact, we&rsquo;ll review this item.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut this is our rating: False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Editor&rsquo;s note: On March 4, 2011, this item was changed to fix an error in the percentage of employee salary that goes toward paying for pensions and health insurance for a hypothetical employee at UW-Eau Claire.) </em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-17T16:58:22.336647", "ruling_date": "2011-02-17T15:57:34", "ruling_headline": "Talk show host Ed Schultz says Wisconsin state employees might lose 20 percent of their income under Gov.
