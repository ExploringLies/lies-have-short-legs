With no Republican opponent in November, the winner of the  runoff will likely be a shoo-in for Travis County&rsquo;s 299th state District  Court judgeship.</p>\r\n<p>In a mailer sent to voters April 3, Sage  celebrates the new program, saying that jail &ldquo;time for non-violent,  mentally ill offenders has been reduced by 50 percent.&rdquo;<br />We wondered  if Sage&rsquo;s statement&mdash;echoed in a TV ad she debuted Wednesday&mdash;reflects  reality.</p>\r\n<p>Sage&rsquo;s campaign initially referred us to Rosemary  Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney. Lehmberg confirmed that  she asked Sage, an assistant district attorney, to helm the felony  mental health unit, which was started in January 2009.</p>\r\n<p>Claire  Dawson-Brown, the DA&rsquo;s director of strategic prosecutions, said a  magistrate started handling a special docket comprised of &ldquo;mental  health&rdquo; defendants in late April 2009. To be in the program,  Dawson-Brown said, defendants must usually be charged with a non-violent  crime. They also must be diagnosed with major depression or considered  bipolar, schizo-affective or schizophrenic, and seen as unstable in the  jail.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It would be someone in a crisis situation,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or  their mental illness is impairing their behavior.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Experts team  to address the needs of the mental health inmates, Dawson-Brown said.  She said participants get services they need in custody and when they  return to the community. Besides Sage, who has a paralegal and a  secretary, each defendant has an attorney familiar with mental health  issues; she said the magistrate, a jail counselor and officials serving  the local mental health and adult probation systems also play roles,  with social workers sometimes getting involved.</p>\r\n<p>And how has the  program affected jail stays?</p>\r\n<p>Sage said she reached her 50-percent  reduction statement by comparing a baseline estimate that &ldquo;mental  health&rdquo; inmates facing felony charges were averaging 106 days in jail  before the program began to the 42-day average for participants in the  program at the time she left the office in mid-December to run for  judge. The decrease amounts to 60 percent.</p>\r\n<p>Dawson-Brown agreed  that as of late 2008 and early 2009, the average Travis County jail stay  for all its &ldquo;mental health&rdquo; defendants, including violent offenders,  was 106 days.</p>\r\n<p>We pointed out that the baseline figure sweeps in  the longer jail stays of individuals charged with violent crimes who  aren&rsquo;t automatically put in the new program, driving up the pre-program  average and potentially skewing before and after comparisons.  Dawson-Brown then gave us more detailed jail-stay information enabling  an improved review of the change in average jail stays.</p>\r\n<p>Based on  the new figures, we estimate that defendants who have been through the  new program would have averaged 77 days in jail before the program  began.</p>\r\n<p>The nitty gritty: We multiplied the number of affected  defendants categorized by the level of felony they faced--ranging from  first-degree felony charges to second- and third-degree felonies to  state-jail felony charges--by the days that similarly charged defendants  averaged in jail before the program began. Next, we totaled those  defendant-days-in-jail and divided the total (19,432) by the number of  defendants (253) to reach the pre-program estimate of an average of 77  days in jail.</p>\r\n<p>Through February, the magistrate had processed 253  defendants since the program&rsquo;s start, according to Dawson-Brown, and  they averaged 36 days in jail.</p>\r\n<p>Best we can tell, the average jail  stay for defendants dropped by 41 days, or 53 percent.</p>\r\n<p>We rate  Sage&rsquo;s statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-09T18:50:14.451528", "ruling_date": "2010-04-10T17:44:49", "ruling_headline": "Karen Sage says jail time has been cut 50 percent for offenders in program focused on mental health", "ruling_headline_slug": "karen-sage-says-jail-time-has-been-cut-50-percent-", "ruling_link_text": "Extra attention shortens stays", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Rosemary Lehmberg,  Travis County district attorney, April 7, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interviews, Claire  Dawson-Brown, director of strategic prosecutions, Travis County  District Attorney's office, April 7, 8 and 9, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interviews,  Karen Sage, April 8 and 9, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Karen Sage campaign, mailer, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04032010_karensagemailer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Karen Sage mailer\">\"From Stigma to Justice,\"</a> sent  April 3, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Travis County District Attorney's  office, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04092010_travisctydach.rtf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Response to Query from PolitiFact Texas\">chart on  average jail stays for mental health defendants before and after new  program,</a> received April 9, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Karen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 371, "last_name": "Sage", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "karen-sage", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/karensage0410.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/371/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.karensageforjudge.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says that under a new program jail \"time for non-violent, mentally ill offenders has been reduced by 50 percent.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a mailer", "statement_date": "2010-04-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
