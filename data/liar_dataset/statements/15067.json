Schildkraut said she only considered two of the incidents &quot;school shootings&quot; &mdash; the Feb. 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas and the Nov. 20, 2014, shooting at Florida State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said the shooters at Stoneman Douglas and FSU had similar motivations, unlike the other incidents on the list that happened after or during an altercation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He goes into a place that he knows is populated and randomly starts shooting,&quot; she said. &quot;It&rsquo;s not targeted violence like the fights and the case where a woman was shot by her husband.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Florida has &lsquo;some of the weakest gun laws in the nation&rsquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To back this point up, Ulvert sent PolitiFact Florida a link to an NBC News article that cited a <a href=\"http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard2016/\">2016 report</a> from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that supports more restrictive gun regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida does have weak gun laws based on this analysis, but saying it has some of the weakest requires context. According to the report, Florida received an F for its gun laws, the lowest grade a state can receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But so did 24 other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grades are assigned based on how many &quot;points&quot; a state earns. The more points, the better the grade. For example, states can earn points if they require a background check for every firearm sale and lose points for laws that allow people to carry concealed, loaded guns in public without a permit, among other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://giffords.org/2018/02/fl_shooting/\">news release</a>, Giffords Law Center also notes that in 2016 Florida had &quot;the nation&rsquo;s 26th highest gun death rate &hellip; and was ranked the 26th worst state for firearm laws.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giffords said Mississippi received the worst score in 2016. While Mississippi received an F last year, its ranking dropped from 49 to 50 because it enacted a law that allows people to carry hidden, loaded guns in public without a license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the shooting, Giffords Law wrote <a href=\"https://giffords.org/2018/02/fl_shooting/\">a news brief</a> pointing out some of Florida&rsquo;s permissive laws, which included the state&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://lawcenter.giffords.org/local-authority-to-regulate-firearms-in-florida/\">pre-emption law</a> that sought to prevent local governments from passing new gun restrictions on their own. The organization claims the law was &quot;designed to severely restrict local authority to regulate firearms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also said that Florida&rsquo;s &quot;stand your ground&quot;&nbsp;law was amended recently to make it &quot;even more dangerous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Levine said that &quot;despite 14 school shootings in eight years (in Florida), we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Levine can count 14 instances in the past eight years where guns were discharged on school grounds. But describing those 14 instances as school shootings is misleading, an expert told us, particularly when compared with, and in the context of, the shooting in Parkland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group that supports tighter gun restrictions, meanwhile, says that Florida does have weak gun laws. But&nbsp;two dozen states share that same description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-22T17:14:07.264163", "ruling_date": "2018-02-23T09:14:54", "ruling_headline": "14 school shootings since 2010 in Florida?
