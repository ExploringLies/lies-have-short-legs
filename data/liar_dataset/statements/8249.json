Scott Walker&rsquo;s attempts to lure companies across the border by portraying Wisconsin as the better place to do business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Atkins, chairman of the Minnesota House of Representatives&rsquo; commerce committee, called a <a href=\"https://www.dfl.org/2013/08/29/in-the-know-aug-29/\"><u>meeting</u></a> of the panel on Aug. 29, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://politicsinminnesota.com/tag/joe-atkins/\"><u>purpose</u></a> was to hear testimony on whether the Badger State is really in a stronger position to attract businesses than the Gopher State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afterward, Atkins, a Democratic&shy;-Farmer&shy;-Labor Party member from the Twin Cities area, declared:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The objective data shows that, frankly, Minnesota is kicking butt relative to Wisconsin on everything from employment and job creation to school test scores, educated workforce and a host of other factors and rankings,&quot; he said, <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/blogs/221706681.html\"><u>according</u></a> to the Minneapolis <em>Star Tribune</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I understand the desire to promote one&#39;s state, but (Walker&rsquo;s) full of baloney when it comes to saying that Wisconsin is a better place to put your business than Minnesota.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Bologna_lunch_meat_style_sausage.JPG/220px-Bologna_lunch_meat_style_sausage.JPG\"><u>Baloney</u></a>, we can&rsquo;t (and don&rsquo;t want) to test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://nikkigsblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/kick_butt.jpg\"><u>&quot;Kicking butt,&quot;</u></a> we can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know, for example, that Wisconsin has <a href=\"http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/wis/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2012-13/misc_non_event/Fact_Book.pdf#page=223\"><u>kicked</u></a> Minnesota&rsquo;s butt in college football for more than a decade, including winning the last nine games in a row.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s check the thrust of Atkins&#39; claim -- that Minnesota&rsquo;s business climate is clearly superior to Wisconsin&rsquo;s based in particular on four measures Atkins singled out, but on other measures, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back the first part of his claim, Atkins cited the unemployment rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest monthly <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\"><u>figures</u></a>, for July 2013, show Minnesota at 5.2 percent, nearly one-quarter lower than Wisconsin&rsquo;s 6.8 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLS data also show that <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LASST27000003?data_tool=XGtable\"><u>Minnesota&rsquo;s</u></a> rate was at least 1.5 percentage points lower than <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LASST55000003?data_tool=XGtable\"><u>Wisconsin&rsquo;s</u></a> in each month from January through June of 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson cited figures showing Wisconsin&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/lfcharacteristics.htm#laborforce\"><u>labor force participation</u></a> exceeded Minnesota&rsquo;s. But labor force participation measures not only people who are employed, but also people who are unemployed but actively looking for work. So, it&rsquo;s not a strict measure of employment, per se.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Job creation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atkins cited the latest month-to-month U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"http://bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm\"><u>figures</u></a>, which show the number of people employed in July 2013 vs. July 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They show that in Minnesota, an additional 55,000 people became employed, compared with 25,800 more in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We calculated that to be an increase of 2 percent for Minnesota, more than double Wisconsin&rsquo;s growth of just under 1 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atkins also cited <a href=\"http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=statebystatereport\">reports</a> by Congress&rsquo; Joint Economic Committee; Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is the committee&rsquo;s co-chair. The latest report, released in July 2013, shows that since the recession, Minnesota job growth was 0.1 percent while Wisconsin lost 1.5 percent of its jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found June 2013 <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2013/06/governors-ranked-by-private-sector-job.html\"><u>rankings</u></a> by <em>The Business Journal</em><em> </em>for private-sector employment growth. Both Walker and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, took office in January 2011. <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2013/06/15-mark-dayton.html\"><u>Dayton</u></a> was ranked 15th among governors, with a 2.01 percent growth rate during his tenure; <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2013/06/40-scott-walker.html\"><u>Walker</u></a> was ranked 40th at 1.07 percent. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>School test scores</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Atkins and Evenson cited results of the ACT college entrance exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We <a href=\"http://www.act.org/newsroom/data/2013/states.html\"><u>found</u></a> that for the class of 2013, among states where more than half the students took the ACT, Minnesota ranked first and Wisconsin tied with Iowa for second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s average score of 23 and Wisconsin&rsquo;s was 22.1. That&#39;s a pretty significant gap, given that the range of scores was small, from 18.7 to 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Educated workforce</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back this part of his claim, Atkins cited the percentage of residents age 25 and over who had a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. His figures were dated, so we found the most recent <a href=\"http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_3YR_S1501&amp;prodType=table\"><u>figures</u></a>, for 2011, which show Minnesota&rsquo;s education attainment about one-fifth higher than Wisconsin&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Minnesota, 31.9 percent of residents had a four-year degree or higher. In Wisconsin, the rate was 26.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how did Atkins&rsquo; four measures score out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minnesota kicked butt in the sense that it outperformed Wisconsin on all four measures, and by comfortable margins. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other measures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of Atkins&#39; claim was that Minnesota also beats Wisconsin on a host of other business climate-related measures. He and Evenson cited some, and we found some, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the measures Atkins cited, the results are more of a mixed bag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On some measures, Minnesota ranked better than Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- <strong>Business climate:</strong> The latest <em>Forbes</em> ranking of states for business, released in December 2012, listed Minnesota 20th and Wisconsin 44th <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/best-states-for-business/list/\"><u>overall</u></a>.
