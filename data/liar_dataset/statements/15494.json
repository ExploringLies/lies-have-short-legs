We did our own reporting and came to the same conclusion that Smith&rsquo;s job remains safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One easy giveaway: Smith was just rehired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith, one of Fox&rsquo;s original hires in 1996, is now the anchor of <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/shows/shepard-smith.html\">Shepard Smith Reporting</a> (weekdays 3-4PM/ET). In March 2018, Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch announced that Smith, the chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news, signed a <a href=\"http://press.foxnews.com/2018/03/fox-news-channel-re-signs-shepard-smith-to-multiyear-deal/\">multiyear agreement.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February, network spokeswoman Irena Briganti told the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/6b4373080a8849e8a1d3f77b0123eaac/Fox-News-Channel-says-Shepard-Smith-has-not-been-fired\">AP</a> that the story that Smith has been let go was &quot;completely false.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith has drawn the ire of some Trump fans because he has criticized the president on air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsflash included an accurate quote by Smith in which he said Trump made a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-media-not-reporting-terrorism-a/\">false statement</a> that the media frequently under-reports radical Islamic terror attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In short, the president&rsquo;s assertion is false,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.bizpacreview.com/2017/02/08/renewed-calls-get-rid-fox-news-shepard-smith-hes-unable-control-contempt-trump-445703\">Smith said</a> in February 2017. &quot;The White House knows that it was false or could have learned that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith told <em><a href=\"http://time.com/longform/shepard-smith-fox-news/\">Time</a></em> in an article published in March that he&rsquo;s not bothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox&rsquo;s opinion slate: &quot;We serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don&rsquo;t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want, if it&rsquo;s their opinion. I don&rsquo;t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I&rsquo;m busy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: This headline is recycled fake news from 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-13T13:04:45.963704", "ruling_date": "2018-06-13T16:54:00", "ruling_headline": "Hoax continues to circulate that Fox's Shepard Smith was fired for Trump comments", "ruling_headline_slug": "hoax-continues-circulate-foxs-shepard-smith-fired", "ruling_link_text": "Still on air", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Newsflash, <a href=\"http://flashnewss.club/breaking-shep-smith-to-be-canned-because-he-cant-control-his-hate-for-donald-trump/\">&quot;BREAKING: Shep Smith To Be Canned Because He Can&rsquo;t Control His Hate For Donald Trump,&quot;</a> June 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News,<a href=\"http://press.foxnews.com/2018/03/fox-news-channel-re-signs-shepard-smith-to-multiyear-deal/\"> &quot;FOX NEWS CHANNEL RE-SIGNS SHEPARD SMITH TO MULTIYEAR DEAL,&quot; </a>March 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philly.com, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/television/fox-news-shepard-smith-trump-gun-control-mike-pence-joy-behar-20180313.html\">&quot;Fox News&#39; Shepard Smith calls out Trump: &#39;That&#39;s not true,&rsquo;&quot;</a> March 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time, <a href=\"http://time.com/longform/shepard-smith-fox-news/\">&quot;Shep Smith Has the Hardest Job on Fox News,&quot;</a> March 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill</em>, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/media/374574-shep-smith-goes-after-trump-for-not-condemning-russia-in-tweetstorm\">&quot;Shepard Smith goes after Trump for not condemning Russia in tweets,&quot;</a> Feb. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bizpac Review, <a href=\"https://www.bizpacreview.com/2017/02/08/renewed-calls-get-rid-fox-news-shepard-smith-hes-unable-control-contempt-trump-445703\">&quot;Renewed calls to get rid of Fox News&rsquo; Shepard Smith after he&rsquo;s unable to control his contempt for Trump,&quot;</a> Feb. 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Factcheck.org, <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/fox-news-shepard-smith-hasnt-been-fired/\">&quot;Fox News&rsquo; Shepard Smith Hasn&rsquo;t Been Fired,&quot; </a>June 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shepard-smith-fired-from-fox-news/\">&quot;Was Shepard Smith Fired from Fox News?&quot; </a>Jan. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/6b4373080a8849e8a1d3f77b0123eaac/Fox-News-Channel-says-Shepard-Smith-has-not-been-fired\">&quot;Fox News Channel says Shepard Smith has not been fired,&quot;</a> Feb. 26, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/08/list-78-terror-attacks-white-house-says-media-didn/\">&quot;The list of 78 terror attacks the White House says the media didn&rsquo;t cover &mdash; but they did,&quot; </a>Feb. 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/18/blog-posting/no-fox-news-anchor-shepard-smith-did-not-punch-sea/\">&quot;No, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith did not punch Sean Hannity in the nose after being fired,&quot; </a>July 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Caley Cronin, Fox News spokeswoman, June 13, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4345, "last_name": "Newsflash", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "newsflash", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/independent_group.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4345/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://flashnewss.club/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Breaking: Shep Smith to be canned because he can&rsquo;t control his hate for Donald Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2018-06-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
