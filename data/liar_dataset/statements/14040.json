The story was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to crack down on fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post focuses on Donald Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1421/release-his-tax-returns-after-audit-completed/\">past promise to release his tax returns</a>, referring to a tweet &nbsp;he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/853595628655587334?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Feric-trump-cancel-taxes-wealthy%2F\">sent out on April 16</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>DemocraticMoms.com cites a fake interview Eric Trump supposedly gave with &quot;KXYL Radio.&quot; The post reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Eric argued that Trump&rsquo;s tax return is &lsquo;irrelevant,&rsquo; largely because &lsquo;he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post goes on, but we know it&rsquo;s fake, because it steals its content almost entirely from an <a href=\"http://politicalo.com/eric-trump-fathers-tax-return-irrelevant-going-cancel-taxes-extra-productive-people-anyway/\">April 16 story on Politicalo.com</a>. The site is related to Newslo.com, which <a href=\"http://politicalo.com/about-us/\">refers to itself in a disclaimer</a> as &quot;the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories on sites under the Newslo.com umbrella take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there&rsquo;s no way to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears DemocraticMoms.com edited some of the details of the original post, such as deleting Politicalo.com&rsquo;s reference to another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/853583417916755968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Feric-trump-cancel-taxes-wealthy%2F\">April 16 Donald Trump tweet</a> backing off his promise to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1412/declare-china-currency-manipulator/\">label China a currency manipulator</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline also has been changed. The original on Politicalo.com read, &quot;Eric Trump: &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s tax return is irrelevant because we&rsquo;re going to cancel taxes for &quot;extra productive people&quot; anyway.&rsquo;&quot; DemocraticMoms.com subbed in the word WEALTHY instead, IN ALL CAPS for extra effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, the story contains entire paragraphs of Politicalo.com&rsquo;s story (Neither version notes that the radio interview is fake; Politicalo.com calls KXYL an Orlando station, but it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://wendleebroadcasting.com/newstalk-102-3-kxyl/\">based in Texas</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DemocraticMoms.com has a cryptic <a href=\"http://democraticmoms.com/about-us-2/\">About Us description</a> that says only that their &quot;team will bring you everything you wanted to know, and some stuff you didn&rsquo;t even know you needed!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no apparent way to contact the site, but every post was steeped in anti-Trump fervor.
