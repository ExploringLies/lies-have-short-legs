Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked then-Attorney General Eric Holder about the training material, presenting among examples a claim that &lsquo;&lsquo;the Arabic mind is swayed more by ideas than facts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is regrettable that that information was, in fact, a part of a training program,&quot; Holder said, adding that there was an ongoing review of training material &quot;to ensure that that kind of misinformation&quot; was not being used, because it could undermine and negatively impact outreach efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI reviewed 160,000 pages of material and eventually removed <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/02/hundreds-fbi-documents-muslims/\">hundreds of pages</a> from its training. Less than 1 percent of the material reviewed had &quot;factually inaccurate or imprecise information or used stereotypes,&quot; the FBI <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/02/hundreds-fbi-documents-muslims/\">told <em>Wired</em></a> in February 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/fbi-training-letter.pdf\">March 2012 letter</a> from Durbin to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller expressed disappointment that the FBI would not produce a written report on the material deemed inappropriate, and that it would not be publicly shared or given to Congress. Durbin&rsquo;s letter said FBI briefers shared copies of &quot;a handful&quot; of the material with Senate Judiciary Committee staff, but were not allowed to keep the copies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI did not confirm to PolitiFact if it eliminated such material, but referred us to public source material and 2012 congressional testimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a May 2012 House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the FBI, Mueller said 876 inappropriate training documents had been removed after a review of 160,000 documents and over 1,000 videos, but did not specify what the material said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, said documents it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit showed that reasons cited for the removal of material included: &quot;Article is highly inflammatory and inaccurately argues the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization,&quot; and &quot;author seems to conflate &lsquo;Islamic Militancy&rsquo; with &lsquo;terrorism&rsquo; and needs to define the difference and use it in their analysis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The excised material included references linking the Muslim Brotherhood to terrorism, tying al Qaeda to the 1993 World Trade Center and Khobar Towers bombings, and suggesting that &lsquo;young male immigrants of Middle Eastern appearance &hellip; may fit the terrorist profile best&rsquo;,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/JWSRGovtPurgeActiveMeasures1SEP2015.pdf\">Judicial Watch said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Perry said the Obama administration purged &quot;training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI removed nearly 900 training documents containing information that was inaccurate, imprecise or depicted stereotypes, after a review of 160,000 pages and more than 1,000 videos. The review came after 2011 media reports about training material portraying Muslims stereotypically and prone to violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the FBI did not publicly disclose the material it rescinded, Judicial Watch said that through a lawsuit for information, it found that removed material included references to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perry&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
