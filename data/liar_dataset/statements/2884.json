This time It came by way of Oregon Catalyst, a conservative political website and a <a href=\"http://www.oregoncatalyst.com/index.php/archives/3689-Oregon-Free-Government-Giveaway-Billboard.html\">picture it </a><a href=\"http://www.oregoncatalyst.com/index.php/archives/3689-Oregon-Free-Government-Giveaway-Billboard.html\">posted </a>of an Oregon Healthy Kids billboard.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlying above pictures of healthy kids and their families and physicians is the sentence &quot;No family earns too much to qualify.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSure, the program has been expanded, but could that possibly be true? Or, as Oregon Catalyst poses the question: &quot;Can anyone explain this? It seems like anyone is entitled to government service whether you need it or not.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check in with Cathy Kaufmann, manager of the Healthy Kids Office, and see whether it&rsquo;s true that any family can qualify for the program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Any Oregon family with an uninsured child has a path to Healthy Kids regardless of income,&quot; she said. However, that insurance may come at a cost that makes it -- for most people -- essentially out of reach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthykids/eligible.shtml\">Any family can get </a><a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthykids/eligible.shtml\">insurance </a>through the Healthy Kids Connect program, Kaufmann explains, but some will pay more than others. Families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about $44,000 a year for a family of four) qualify for free child health care. Families earning between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level (about $66,000 for a family of four -- also Oregon&rsquo;s median income) qualify for subsidized health care on a sliding scale.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow for the third category: Those families making more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Well, they could still enroll their children through Healthy Kids Connect, but they won&rsquo;t get any financial break, Kaufmann said. In fact, because the Healthy Kids coverage is so comprehensive -- it covers medical, dental and vision care -- they&rsquo;ll be paying a pretty high yearly premium. Possibly as much as $3,400, according to a <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/OPHP/kidsconnect/docs/rate_sheet.pdf\">rate </a><a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/OPHP/kidsconnect/docs/rate_sheet.pdf\">sheet </a>posted on the Healthy Kids website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it seems, the billboard is factually accurate. Any family can qualify, whether they make $1 a year or $1 billion. That said, it seems to us Oregon Healthy Kids could have been more precise in their advertising: Families do have to meet certain income limits to qualify for<em> assistance</em>. We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/12/politifact_oregon_just_who_qua.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-30T19:46:59.161721", "ruling_date": "2010-12-01T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Oregon Healthy Kids says no matter how much you make, you qualify for health care program", "ruling_headline_slug": "oregon-healthy-kids-says-no-matter-how-much-you-ma", "ruling_link_text": "You\u2019ll qualify, but it might cost you", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregoncatalyst.com/index.php/archives/3689-Oregon-Free-Government-Giveaway-Billboard.html\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.4702710155323804\">Oregon Catalyst blog post</a>, Nov. 22, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Cathy Kaufmann, Nov. 24, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Jason Williams, contributor to Oregon Catalyst, Nov. 29, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHealthy Kids Connect <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/OPHP/kidsconnect/docs/rate_sheet.pdf\">rate sheet</a>, Feb. 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHealthy Kids web site, <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthykids/eligible.shtml\">eligibility information</a>, Oct. 5, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "state program", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 882, "last_name": "Oregon Healthy Kids", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "oregon-healthy-kids", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/hk_insidebanner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/882/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthykids/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;No family earns too much to qualify&quot; for Oregon Healthy Kids program.</p>", "statement_context": "a billboard", "statement_date": "2010-11-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
