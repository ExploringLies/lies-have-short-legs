What would happen if Christians don&rsquo;t obey?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Christians don&rsquo;t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God,&quot; the story quoted Copeland as saying. &quot;Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Copeland didn&rsquo;t say this, because the story is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copeland did support Trump prior to the election, and served as <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/june-web-only/whos-who-of-trumps-tremendous-faith-advisors.html\">one of the billionaire&rsquo;s faith advisers</a> during the presidential campaign. He also told followers in October 2016 that there would be consequences for skipping a vote for Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re going to be guilty of murder,&quot; he said <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/kenneth-copeland-christians-who-dont-vote-for-trump-are-going-to-be-guilty-of-murder/\">on a TV program</a>. &quot;You&rsquo;re going to be guilty of an abomination of God. You&rsquo;re going to be guilty of every baby that&rsquo;s aborted from this election forward.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com didn&rsquo;t indicate its post was fake, but the site is known to carry bogus stories. We tried to contact the website through their contact form, but did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears that the site took the story (rearranging it a bit) from a parody site called BizStandardNews.com. The original post was <a href=\"http://bizstandardnews.com/2016/08/10/copeland-says-christians-who-vote-against-trump-will-be-cursed-with-poverty-gay-children/\">dated Aug. 10, 2016</a>, before Trump became president, and didn&rsquo;t refer to him as the chief executive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Business Standard News, complete with a &quot;BS&quot; logo, noted that it made up its stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle,&quot; the site said on its &quot;<a href=\"http://bizstandardnews.com/about/\">About</a>&quot; link. &quot;The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That BizStandardNews.com story also included references to evangelical Trump supporter David Barton, the founder of the group <a href=\"https://wallbuilders.com/\">WallBuilders</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barton did say on <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/david-barton-christians-who-refuse-to-vote-for-donald-trump-will-have-to-answer-to-god/\">on Aug. 10</a> that Christians would &quot;answer to God&quot; if they didn&rsquo;t exercise their God-given responsibility to vote, supporting Trump. References to Barton were edited out of the version appropriated by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But again, Copeland didn&rsquo;t say God would punish Trump opponents by affecting the sexual orientation of their offspring. The quote was made up by a parody site and reused by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-11T17:27:59.980008", "ruling_date": "2017-04-11T17:21:21", "ruling_headline": "Evangelical leader Kenneth Copeland did not threaten Trump opponents with having homosexual children", "ruling_headline_slug": "evangelical-leader-kenneth-copeland-did-not-threat", "ruling_link_text": "A made-up quote attributed to a supporter", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://alternativemediasyndicate.com/2017/04/07/evangelical-leader-says-oppose-trump-punished-gay-child-2/\">Evangelical Leader Says Those Who Oppose Trump Could Be &quot;Punished&quot; with Gay Child</a>,&quot; April 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christianity Today, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/june-web-only/whos-who-of-trumps-tremendous-faith-advisors.html\">Who&rsquo;s Who of Trump&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tremendous&rsquo; Faith Advisers</a>,&quot; June 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BizStandardNews.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://bizstandardnews.com/2016/08/10/copeland-says-christians-who-vote-against-trump-will-be-cursed-with-poverty-gay-children/\">Copeland Says Christians Who Vote Against Trump Will Be Cursed With Poverty, Gay Children</a>,&quot; Aug. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RightWingWatch.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/david-barton-christians-who-refuse-to-vote-for-donald-trump-will-have-to-answer-to-god/\">David Barton: Christians Who Refuse To Vote For Donald Trump Will Have To Answer To God</a>,&quot; Aug. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RightWingWatch.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/kenneth-copeland-christians-who-dont-vote-for-trump-are-going-to-be-guilty-of-murder/\">Kenneth Copeland: Christians Who Don&rsquo;t Vote For Trump Are &lsquo;Going To Be Guilty Of Murder&rsquo;</a>,&quot; Oct. 11, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Evangelical leader says those who oppose Trump could be &lsquo;punished&rsquo; with gay child.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2017-04-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
