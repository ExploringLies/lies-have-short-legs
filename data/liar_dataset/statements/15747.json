(Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story quotes part of Pelosi&rsquo;s interview on AM Joy on MSNBC Aug. 12. Much of the interview focused on the midterms and the Democrats&rsquo; message to voters. The interviewer, Jonathan Capehart, also asked Pelosi if she planned to give up the speakership if the Democrats take back the House. (<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/dozens-democratic-candidates-say-they-would-oppose-pelosi-house-speaker-n899271\">NBC</a> reported Aug. 10 that 50 Democrats running for the House say they won&#39;t support the California lawmaker for speaker. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/16/us/politics/dems-opposing-pelosi.html\">New York Times</a> then found 60 Democratic House candidates have said that they prefer new leadership if the party wins back the House in November.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Conservative Tribune story combined actual quotes from Pelosi with its own extrapolation of what she &quot;essentially&quot; meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrulcEJwQ4\">actually told MSNBC</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well first of all, let me just say this, and I know NBC has been on a jag of this. This is one of their priorities to undermine my prospect as speaker. But putting that aside, I have not asked one person for a vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I haven&rsquo;t asked a candidate or an incumbent for a vote. What&rsquo;s important, and I know better than anybody how important it is for us to win this election because I see up close and personal what the Republicans and this president are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not think our opponents should select the leaders of our party. The Republicans are spending millions -- tens of millions of dollars against me because they&rsquo;re afraid of me, because I outraise them in the political arena, because I outsmart them at the negotiating table and because I&rsquo;m a woman who&rsquo;s going to be a seat at that table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And that, for me, is very important. If Hillary Clinton had won and had sat at the head of that table, it&rsquo;d be different. But I&rsquo;m not yielding - I&rsquo;m not yielding that. Now I do believe that none of us is indispensable, but I think I&rsquo;m the best person for the job and I won&rsquo;t let the Republican ads, which are just flooding these districts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And I say to the candidates &lsquo;do whatever you have to do, just win, baby.&rsquo; I know one in five children in America lives in poverty. We must win this. When the caucus decides, it will decide whose name they will send to the floor - only then, after the election, will I ask people for their support.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Pelosi did say that candidates should &quot;do whatever you have to do&quot; when asked to respond to Democratic candidates saying she should hand over the gavel, but she didn&rsquo;t tell them to lie to their constituents. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the interview, Pelosi shared some other advice she gives to candidates: &quot;don&rsquo;t even mention Donald Trump. It&rsquo;s not about him, he&rsquo;s self evident. It&rsquo;s about your relationship to the constituents. Their financial security, which is related to health care, cost of prescription drugs, cost of premiums, Medicare, Medicaid, pre-existing condition as a benefit. ...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi&rsquo;s spokesman Drew Hammill said he had nothing to add. We sent an email to the teaparty.org website and a Facebook message to the Conservative Tribune and we did not get a response by deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline said, &quot;Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it.&quot; Pelosi said in an interview on MSNBC that she says to &quot;candidates do whatever you have to do, just win, baby&quot; but we found no evidence she told them to lie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi&rsquo;s additional advice to candidates was to not make the election about Trump but make it about voters&rsquo; financial security and health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-17T10:10:46.575959", "ruling_date": "2018-08-17T16:24:30", "ruling_headline": "No, Nancy Pelosi didn't tell Democratic candidates to lie", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-nancy-pelosi-didnt-tell-democratic-candidates-l", "ruling_link_text": "She didn't say that", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Teaparty.org, <a href=\"https://www.teaparty.org/pelosi-sinks-new-low-tells-dems-lie-voters-win-319348/\">&quot;Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it,&quot;</a> Aug. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservative Tribune, <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/ct/pelosi-sinks-to-new-low-tells-dems-if-you-have-to-lie-to-voters-to-win-do-it/\">&quot;Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it,&quot; </a>Aug. 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC, &quot;AM Joy Interview with Rep.
