I can be that voice. I&#39;m a Muslim and speak fluent Arabic, which is the third most-common language in Austin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not so for all of Austin, we found, but it has been so among patients seeking care at clinics overseen by Central Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all of Texas, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1NQq0u8\">we previously found True</a> a 2016 claim by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that Vietnamese is the state&rsquo;s third most-spoken language. Cornyn&rsquo;s statement was backed up by U.S. Census Bureau survey results. Those results placed Arabic about No. 10 in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spokesman: Appointee meant to limit claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ted Burton, a Central Health spokesman, responded to our request for the basis of Museitif&rsquo;s statement by saying she meant to say something less. &quot;Museitif,&quot; Burton wrote, &quot;was referring to CommUnityCare&rsquo;s patient population &ndash; meaning patients in our community that Central Health serves.&quot; He said the online press release quoting Museitif would be amended to quote her calling Arabic &quot;the third most common language in the CommUnityCare patient population.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central Health&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.centralhealth.net/about-us/\">says</a> it works through a network of<a href=\"http://www.centralhealth.net/about-us/community-health-partners/\"> health care partners</a> and community members to connect uninsured, underinsured and low-income residents with high-quality, cost-effective health care. Its all-volunteer board consists of four members appointed by the council, four by the Travis County Commissioners Court &mdash; plus one joint appointee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burton wrote that in fiscal 2015, a little over half of the entity&rsquo;s patients spoke English, nearly 44 percent spoke Spanish--and, third in concentration, 1.1 percent reported speaking Arabic, according to self-reported patient data.

According to those survey results, Arabic was Austin&rsquo;s 12th most-common spoken language &mdash; though we noticed that if you apply the survey&rsquo;s margin of error figures as much as possible to drive up the number of Austin Arabic speakers and apply respective margins of error to drive down the number of speakers of some other languages, it&rsquo;s possible to place Arabic fifth in the city, behind English, Spanish, Chinese and &quot;Other Asian Languages.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan Robinson, the City of Austin demographer, drew on the bureau&rsquo;s five-year ACS results through 2015 to provide a<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YuEnNsVaeCs_WG7XCLMIbfNbFU27KjWovhlnRzfWN24/edit?usp=sharing\"> chart</a> showing Arabic 10th in prevalence among spoken languages in Austin behind English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, other Asian languages, Korean, Hindi, French and other Indic languages.
