When we received a nearly identical version a couple of years ago, we said it could be &quot;a new classic of the genre.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe email claims that Congress gets special perks nobody else does; complains that a complacent media ignores the news, and requests that recipients of the email forward it on to 20 more people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe examined one of the special perks mentioned in the email, that &quot;the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans.&quot; The claim is confusingly worded, but we assumed that it referred to relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe gave the statement a rating of Pants on Fire because it was (and is) ridiculously false. Relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers have to pay back their loans like everyone else.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the still-circulating email contains another claim that several readers have asked about in recent days: that members of Congress can &quot;retire with the same pay after only one term.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis claim is a classic in its own right. Our friends at the urban legend checker Snopes.com say it has been circulating in various chain emails since at least 2000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe claim means that rank-and-file members of the House of Representatives would receive full pay of $174,000 per year, for the rest of their lives, after serving as little as two years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNice work if you can get it. But members of Congress can&#39;t.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA report on &quot;Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress,&quot; prepared in November by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, outlines how pension benefits are calculated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member&#39;s salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s an example, using a typical 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year. The pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, multiply $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, multiply $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01 and add that number to the first calculation. The total: about $67,250 per year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That&#39;s generous, but not close to full pay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFederal law prevents members of Congress from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, &quot;By law, the starting amount of a member&#39;s retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo the email saying that members of Congress can &quot;receive full pay retirement after serving one term&quot; is blatantly bogus. It&#39;s never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSnopes.com rated the pension claim as False. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org have also debunked the claim -- which, over the years, has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don&#39;t pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or that they don&#39;t contribute anything toward their retirement (they do).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a bogus claim that&rsquo;s been circulating at least 13 years, and for anyone who still spreads it, we&rsquo;ll break out the matches.
