We have tried and fallen short, we've stalled for time, and again we have failed to act because of Washington politics or industry lobbying.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n We wondered whether Roosevelt really proposed reform on the scale of the near-universal health care Obama advocates, or if the new president was pushing the whole bipartisan-appeal thing a bit far.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n We consulted two well-regarded biographers of Roosevelt, H.W. Brands and Kathleen Dalton. Both confirmed that in 1912, when the former Republican president was running as a Progressive Party candidate&nbsp;for what would have been his third term (after a four-year break), the party advocated national health insurance in its\n <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29617\" target=\"_blank\">\n  platform\n </a>\n .\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Health care was the 11th issue listed under &quot;Social and Industrial Justice,&quot; after occupational safety, a child labor prohibition, a minimum wage, &quot;one day's rest in seven&quot; and other progressive ideas.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;The supreme duty of the Nation is the conservation of human resources through an enlightened measure of social and industrial justice,&quot; the platform said. &quot;We pledge ourselves to work unceasingly in State and Nation for ... the protection of home life against the hazards of sickness, irregular employment and old age through the adoption of a system of social insurance adapted to American use.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;What this envisioned was pretty much what FDR accomplished with Social Security, but with health insurance added,&quot; said Brand, author of\n <em>\n  TR: The Last Romantic\n </em>\n (1998).\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n &quot;We don&rsquo;t know the specifics of the plan,&quot; said Dalton, author of\n <em>\n  Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life\n </em>\n (2002). &quot;The roots were probably British, though he knew about German health insurance.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Dalton said unequivocally Obama was on solid ground evoking Roosevelt. Brands more or less agreed, though he cautioned that health care was &quot;not the priority that trust-busting or conservation was&quot; for Roosevelt. &quot;It's worth remembering that health care was a far smaller concern in those days,&quot; Brands said. &quot;Doctors had few medicines, and most people died or got better on their own. The biggest issues were public health &mdash; eradicating malaria, cleaning up water supplies, and so on.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n In\n <em>\n  Healthcare Reform in America: A Reference Handbook\n </em>\n (2004), Jennie Kronenfeld, a sociology professor at Arizona State University, writes that &quot;this was the first inclusion of a health insurance plank in any national platform with a major candidate, although the Socialist Party had endorsed a compulsory system as early as 1904.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Roosevelt and the Progressives, nicknamed the Bull Moose Party, lost the election to Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic Party candidate.
