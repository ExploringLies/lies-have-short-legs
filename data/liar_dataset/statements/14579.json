Republican hold 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they could afford to lose two senators, and still pass the legislation, with the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote. No Democrats were expected to support the legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of Sept. 25, however, three Senate Republicans &mdash; Maine Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Arizona Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul &mdash; were firm &quot;no&quot; votes. Still&nbsp;others expressed skepticism about the overhaul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So at most, even with all senators in attendance, Republicans had 49 votes in the Senate, short of the simple majority it needed for the bill to clear the chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Is the &lsquo;hospitalized&rsquo; senator the sticking point?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s repeated claims about a hospitalized senator were an apparent reference to Sen.
