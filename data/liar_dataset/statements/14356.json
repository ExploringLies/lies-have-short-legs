Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., of saying something she didn&rsquo;t say; we rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/14/uspoln/no-bachmann-didnt-say-whites-suffered-more-under-o/\">Pants on Fire</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as questionable a post from someone Bachmann used to babysit for -- former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. (Yes, the babysitting part is actually <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/22/michele-bachman-gretchen-carlson-babysitter_n_1108551.html\">true</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim about Carlson appeared first on a site called therightists.com. It was headlined, &quot;<a href=\"http://therightists.com/gretchen-carlson-the-2nd-amendment-was-written-before-guns-were-invented/\">Gretchen Carlson: &lsquo;The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented</a>.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within days, the item was <a href=\"https://www.patriotsontheright.com/2017/07/05/gretchen-carlson-2nd-amendment-written-guns-invented/\">picked up</a> and reprinted essentially verbatim on other websites. One <a href=\"http://redherald.com/gretchen-carlson-2nd-amendment-written-guns-invented/\">version</a> got 31,400 shares through July 24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The accompanying article uses as its launching-off point something that Carlson did actually do -- making an on-air break with conservative orthodoxy by saying, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub mass shooting in 2016, that the assault-weapons ban should be reinstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?&quot; <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/gretchen-carlson-doubles-down-on-assault-weapons-ban-after-fox-viewers-send-tons-of-f-bombs/\">she asked</a> on air. &quot;Can&rsquo;t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These comments drew <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/06/15/fox-news-gretchen-carlson-doubles-ar-15-ban/\">opposition</a> from gun-rights supporters. It&rsquo;s at this point that the article veers off into fabrication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article reads, &quot;Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that &lsquo;the fact that you&rsquo;re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you&rsquo;re ignorant. Don&rsquo;t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would be a ridiculous claim if she&rsquo;d actually said it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As schoolchildren are taught, muskets were used in the American Revolution. (<a href=\"https://www.amrevmuseum.org/collection/american-musket\">Here&rsquo;s an example</a> from the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution.) And the revolution occurred more than a decade before the 1789 drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. (&quot;<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed</a>.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the history of firearms goes back <a href=\"http://www.nramuseum.com/gun-info-research/a-brief-history-of-firearms.aspx\">even</a> <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/technique/gun-timeline/\">further</a> than that -- to the 1300s, more than four centuries before the Second Amendment was written.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first hint that this may be bogus appears elsewhere on therightists.com website. On the site&rsquo;s &quot;<a href=\"http://therightists.com/about-us/\">About Us</a>&quot; page, a grammatically challenged warning explains that therightists.com &quot;is independent News platform That allow People and independent Journalist to bring the news directly to the readers. Readers come to us as a source of independent news that not effected from the big channels. This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet.

In a statement, her office confirmed that the article was &quot;total B.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: Carlson did not say, &quot;The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.&quot; The accusation that she did rates as Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-24T14:46:02.731431", "ruling_date": "2017-07-24T15:17:20", "ruling_headline": "No, Gretchen Carlson didn't say 2nd Amendment written before guns invented", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-gretchen-carlson-didnt-say-2nd-amendment-writte", "ruling_link_text": "Guns came first by four centuries", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>therightists.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://therightists.com/gretchen-carlson-the-2nd-amendment-was-written-before-guns-were-invented/\">Gretchen Carlson: &lsquo;The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented</a>,&rsquo; &quot; June 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>therightists.com, &nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http://therightists.com/about-us/\">About Us</a>&quot; page, accessed July 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/06/15/fox-news-gretchen-carlson-doubles-ar-15-ban/\">Fox News&rsquo; Gretchen Carlson Doubles Down On AR-15 Ban</a>,&quot; June 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw Story, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/gretchen-carlson-doubles-down-on-assault-weapons-ban-after-fox-viewers-send-tons-of-f-bombs/\">Gretchen Carlson doubles down on assault weapons ban after Fox viewers send &lsquo;tons of F-bombs</a>,&rsquo; &quot; June 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text of the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museum of the American Revolution, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.amrevmuseum.org/collection/american-musket\">Objects: American Musket</a>,&quot; accessed July 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBS, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/technique/gun-timeline/\">gun timeline</a>, accessed July 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huffington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/22/michele-bachman-gretchen-carlson-babysitter_n_1108551.html\">Michele Bachmann Babysat Gretchen Carlson</a>,&quot; Nov. 22, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/14/uspoln/no-bachmann-didnt-say-whites-suffered-more-under-o/\">No, Bachmann didn&#39;t say whites suffered more under Obama than blacks during slavery</a>,&quot; July 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement from <a href=\"https://www.gretchencarlson.com/\">office of Gretchen Carlson</a>, July 24, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Say Gretchen Carlson said, &quot;The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a web post", "statement_date": "2017-06-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
