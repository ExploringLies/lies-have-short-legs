We had heard rumblings on social networks about magical pizza seeds and pizza gardens &mdash; all in response to Congress&#39; action &mdash; and we had to know. Was it true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s more from Democrats&#39; message:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<em>Why? Because a massive lobbying effort of Republican lawmakers by the frozen pizza industry, among other corporate interests, is underway to get around Obama Administration guidelines to make school lunches contain healthier options.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this Republican Congress, almost anything is up for sale to the highest bidder and most powerful lobbyists -- including the literal definition of the word &quot;vegetable&quot; -- and this time, it&#39;s coming at the expense of our kids&#39; health ...<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLook, we could have a lot of fun with this one. But the fact is that there is a very real bottom line: Childhood obesity has tripled in the past three decades. And for some kids, school lunches are some of the best nutrition options they have during the day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSchool lunches are hard to change -- and it doesn&#39;t take a doozy like &quot;pizza is a vegetable&quot; to know that the corporate interests have more money and more Washington lobbyists than kids do. That&#39;s why pizza was classified as a vegetable during the Bush years. The Obama administration made that common-sense change, but the Republican Congress wants to take us back to the money-for-influence status quo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you think this is as ridiculous as we do, tell the GOP that it&#39;s time they started picking real people over corporations (and real vegetables over slices of pizza, for that matter).</em></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen it linked to a message for folks to send from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://my.democrats.org/page/s/pizza-is-not-a-vegetable?source=20111117_bw_full&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=obama&amp;utm_campaign=20111117_bw_full\">MyDemocrats.org/Pizza</a>. (The message: &quot;Dear House Republicans, Pizza is not a vegetable. Sincerely, America.&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe <em>could</em> have a lot of fun with this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the source of the e-mail, Brad Woodhouse at the Democratic National Committee, to back up his statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe sent us a CBS News/Associated Press article from Nov. 15, 2011, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57325333-10391704/congress-pushes-back-on-healthier-school-lunches/\">Congress pushes back on healthier school lunches</a>.&quot; The topic? A spending bill that forces the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ignore a proposed change from the Obama administration about how to credit tomato paste. (Congress simply won&#39;t fund implementation of the new rule.) The House and Senate both approved the bill Nov. 17, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/signed-legislation\">the president signed it</a>&nbsp;the next day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new law&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-01-13/pdf/2011-485.pdf\">doesn&#39;t mention pizza</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat it does is allow just two tablespoons of tomato paste to continue to count as a serving of vegetables. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-01-13/pdf/2011-485.pdf\">USDA had proposed</a>&nbsp;requiring a full half-cup of the concentrated tomato spread before it would count as a fruit or veggie &mdash; a standard &quot;serving&quot; by volume &mdash; far more than you&#39;d find slathered on a slice o&#39; school cafeteria pizza.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(And, yes, we&#39;re aware the tomato is <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tomato\">technically a fruit</a>. The federal regulations cover both fruits and vegetables, but most folks in this debate are referring to tomatoes as vegetables. Just roll with it.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow crazy is considering tomato paste on a pizza as a vegetable? One <em>Washington Post</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/did-congress-declare-pizza-as-a-vegetable-not-exactly/2011/11/20/gIQABXgmhN_blog.html\">Wonkblog reporter</a>&nbsp;said that it&#39;s not as nuts as you might think. Sarah Kliff pointed out that two tablespoons of tomato paste offer up a nutritional profile comparable to a half-cup of apples or other fresh fruit. It offers more than a gram each of fiber and protein and more calcium and potassium than the apples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt also packs beta carotene and the antioxidant lycopene,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=17032\">according the the USDA</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should also note that the slices kids get at school aren&#39;t exactly the greasy, meat-laden marvels they might pick up at a pizza parlor. Federal nutrition standards require that school meals get no more than 30 percent of their calories from fat, and less than 10 percent from saturated fat.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theschwanfoodcompany.com/BU/pressreleases/LiveSmart_schools_announcement.pdf\">Schwan Food Co.</a>, which makes 70 percent of school-lunch pizza, started adding protein and whole grains to crusts and pushing down fat and salt to meet school standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot to mention, if that slice doesn&#39;t have at least two tablespoons of tomato paste on it, it&#39;s not going to fly. No creamy white or pesto pizza gets automatic credit. (Well, unless that pesto&#39;s made from enough basil or spinach ... but we digress.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director for Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a Nov. 15&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cspinet.org/new/201111151.html\">press release</a>&nbsp;that, &quot;if finalized, this legislation may go down in nutritional history as a bigger blunder than when the Reagan Administration tried (but failed) to credit ketchup as a vegetable in the school lunch program. Pizza should be served with a vegetable, not count as one.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe&#39;s right that if the tomato paste didn&#39;t count as a serving of vegetables, kids would benefit from tomato-paste-covered pizza plus an additional serving of a vegetable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is this the great Reagan ketchup debacle?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same amount of ketchup,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=17032\">according to the USDA</a>, sneaks in about 10 times the sodium, contains just a third of the protein, less than a tenth of the fiber and more carbs and sugar. It offers smaller traces of vitamins, and half the beta carotene and lycopene. Tomato paste is not ketchup.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/wellness/134208058.html\">frozen pizza manufacturers</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.affi.org/assets/news/affi-lauds-congress-balanced-approach-school-meals.pdf\">frozen food industry</a>&nbsp;did push hard to keep the vegetable designation for the tomato paste on the pizza. When it does, that&#39;s one less vegetable the school has to buy and a cheaper deal for school districts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFewer vegetables for kids may not be exactly a win for America. But did House Republicans try &quot;to classify pizza as a &#39;vegetable&#39; for the purpose of school lunches&quot;? They did fight for the classification for the sauce on the pizza and blocked a move by the Obama administration to boost the amount of tomato paste needed to count as a serving of vegetables. But they didn&#39;t try to classify &quot;pizza&quot; as a vegetable. And even the amount of tomato paste required, just two tablespoons, packs nearly the nutritional punch of a half-cup of other foods we consider healthy. That&#39;s a pretty important detail to omit. We call the Democrats&#39; claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-22T08:28:51.051110", "ruling_date": "2011-11-22T10:41:44", "ruling_headline": "Republican lawmakers classified pizza as a vegetable for school lunches, Democrats say", "ruling_headline_slug": "republicans-pizza-vegetable-school-lunch", "ruling_link_text": "It's not ketchup", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail to Democrats sent by Brad Woodhouse, communications director, Democratic National Committee, Nov. 17, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocratic National Committee, &quot;<a href=\"http://my.democrats.org/page/s/pizza-is-not-a-vegetable?source=20111117_bw_full&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=obama&amp;utm_campaign=20111117_bw_full\">Pizza Is Not A Vegetable</a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Brad Woodhouse, communications director, Democratic National Committee, Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Corey Henry, vice president of communications for the American Frozen Food Institute, Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCBS News/Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57325333-10391704/congress-pushes-back-on-healthier-school-lunches/\">Congress pushes back on healthier school lunches</a>,&quot; Nov. 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSchool Nutrition Association, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.schoolnutrition.org/Blog.aspx?id=16352&amp;blogid=145506\">Update: House and Senate approve agriculture appropriations bill</a>,&quot; Nov. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse of Representatives,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rules.house.gov/Legislation/legislationDetails.aspx?NewsID=601\">Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act 2012</a>, Nov. 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite House,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/signed-legislation\">Signed Legislation</a>, accessed Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMerriam-Webster,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tomato\">Tomato</a>, accessed Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartment of Agriculture, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-01-13/pdf/2011-485.pdf\">Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs</a>,&quot; proposed rule, Jan. 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington Post&#39;s Wonkblog, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/did-congress-declare-pizza-as-a-vegetable-not-exactly/2011/11/20/gIQABXgmhN_blog.html\">No, Congress did not declare pizza a vegetable</a>,&quot; Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNPR, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/11/15/142360146/pizza-as-a-vegetable-it-depends-on-the-sauce\">Pizza As A Vegetable?
