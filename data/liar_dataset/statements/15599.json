He was also the owner of many other businesses and properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Times</em> wrote: &quot;Donald J. Trump is the man of the hour. Turn on the television or open a newspaper almost any day of the week and there he is, snatching some star form the National Football League, announcing some preposterously lavish project he wants to build. Public-relations firms call him, offering to handle his account for nothing, so that they might take credit for the torrential hoopla.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing in the article declared that Trump would be the best president. The article did include a line that Trump said he didn&rsquo;t want to be president:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers,&quot; the <em>Times</em> wrote. &quot;All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything. He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bling News drew its report from another website, <a href=\"https://100percentfedup.com/this-is-amazing-in-1984-the-new-york-times-said-trump-would-be-our-best-president-they-forgot/\">100percentfedup</a>.

We give you credit for understanding where we&rsquo;re coming from. Factcheck.org has claimed that the New York Times didn&rsquo;t say Trump would be our BEST president. To clarify, if you read the intro paragraph of the article we hope you&rsquo;ll think subjectively and understand what we said about the article. We believe that the New York Times INADVERTENTLY DESCRIBED HOW TRUMP WOULD BE A PERFECT FIT FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA, therefore, THE BEST PRESIDENT &lsquo;FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no contact information on Bling News&rsquo; website. The <em>New York Times</em> magazine story in 1984 didn&rsquo;t say that Trump would be our best president; instead, it was an in-depth profile of Trump the businessman.
