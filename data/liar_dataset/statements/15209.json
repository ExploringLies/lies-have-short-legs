Andrew Cuomo for the lag, calling it a broken promise. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 2014, Andrew Cuomo promised that he was going to expand pre-K to all of New York&#39;s children, not just those in New York City,&quot; Nixon said at a press conference in Albany. &quot;But four years later, 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City lack full-day pre-K.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo and state lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/nyregion/cuomo-in-state-of-state-speech-unveils-tax-cuts-and-pre-k-pledge.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=ADD71561350C78FE3937DE105E14CE93&amp;gwt=pay\">approved</a> a five-year plan in the 2014 state budget to subsidize statewide pre-K. The plan earmarked $1.5 billion for pre-K through 2019, with $340 million for the first year. Most of the first-year money &mdash; $300 million &mdash; went to New York City schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Nixon right that 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City don&rsquo;t have access to full-day pre-K?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon was citing a statistic from a <a href=\"http://www.aqeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Opportunities-Foreclosed-2018-Budget-FINAL-REPORT.pdf\">report</a> by a handful of education advocacy groups, including the Alliance for Quality Education</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report used data from the state Education Department. A spokesperson for the department sent us the data. The numbers reflect access to state-funded pre-K for 4-year-olds during the 2016-2017 school year, the latest data available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state counted 103,679 4-year-olds outside New York City during that school year. Only 22,124 of them had access to state-funded full-day pre-K, according to the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That translates to about 21 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City with access to state-funded full-day pre-K. So that means 79 percent of the children did not have state-funded full-day pre-K, confirming Nixon&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean the other 81,555 4-year-olds did not have access to pre-K altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty-five percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City had access to state-funded half-day pre-K, meaning 46 percent of them&nbsp;had pre-K during that school year. Added to the New York City 4-year-olds who&nbsp;had full-day pre-K that year, about two-thirds of 4-year-olds statewide had access to state-funded full- or half-day pre-K.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between New York City, Long Island, and upstate New York, about 66 percent of 4-year-olds statewide had access to either state-funded full or half-day pre-K.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Was there a deadline?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon is right that Cuomo promised to expand pre-K to children statewide. But Cuomo never promised statewide pre-K by the 2016-2017 school year, and the 2014 state budget did not set a deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo pledged funding for statewide pre-K during a radio interview before the state budget passed in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re going to have a statewide pre-K program funded by the state,&quot; Cuomo <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/10/de-blasio-wants-verifiable-state-funding-for-prekindergarten/\">said</a>. &quot;That&rsquo;s what we said we&rsquo;re going to do, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo said after the 2014 budget passed that timing would depend on local districts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have to watch the implementation rate and how fast we can actually make universal pre-K a reality and where,&quot; Cuomo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=70&amp;v=1Et0jRjlCCA\">said</a>. &quot;But we have the funding to move the program at the pace the localities can move the program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state has more than doubled its funding for pre-K since 2013, from $410 million to more than $800 million.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boost in funding did not change the share of 4-year-olds with access to pre-K outside New York City between the 2014 and 2016 school years. Only about 46 percent of those students had access to either full or half-day pre-K during the 2014-2015 school year, according to state data. That share was the same two years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon claimed that 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City don&rsquo;t have access to full-day pre-K four years after funding was earmarked in the state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest data supports Nixon&rsquo;s claim, though it&rsquo;s from the 2016-2017 school year. That&rsquo;s three years after Cuomo and lawmakers committed funding for universal pre-K, not four as Nixon said. There was also never a deadline to implement statewide pre-K by the start of that school year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her claim was accurate but we thought it needed&nbsp;additional information. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-30T12:27:57.609454", "ruling_date": "2018-03-30T15:47:10", "ruling_headline": "Do most children outside New York City lack full-day pre-kindergarten, as Nixon said?", "ruling_headline_slug": "do-most-children-outside-new-york-city-lack-full-d", "ruling_link_text": "State data confirms it", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email conversation with press staff from Nixon&rsquo;s campaign</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Report: &quot;<a href=\"http://www.aqeny.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Opportunities-Foreclosed-2018-Budget-FINAL-REPORT.pdf\">Opportunities Foreclosed Equity Denied</a>&quot;, September 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data obtained from the New York State Education Department</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Julia Watson from the Alliance for Quality Education</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone conversation with Morris Peters, spokesperson from the state Division of Budget</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&amp;bn=A08556&amp;term=2013&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Text=Y&amp;Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&amp;Floor%26nbspVotes=Y\">A08556D - Universal pre-K budget bill, 2014</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Actress and Education Advocate", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Cynthia", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "New York", "id": 4246, "last_name": "Nixon", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "cynthia-nixon", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Cynthia_Nixon_thumbnail.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4246/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://cynthiafornewyork.com"}, "statement": "<p>Four years after Gov.
