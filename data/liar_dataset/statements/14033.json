Respondents were asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable view of each, or had never heard of them. The 16 included prominent figures, such Sanders, Trump and Clinton, and the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, but also lesser-known Trump appointees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pollster.com co-founder Charles Franklin, director of polling at the Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said it is common in non-election years for the president, vice president, congressional leaders and perhaps a prominent senator or two to be included in such polls. But including presidential staff members &quot;is dubious, as they are not known to a lot of voters,&quot; he told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders had the best showing in the Harvard-Harris survey, with 57 percent saying they had a favorable opinion of him.

Obama&rsquo;s average favorability rating was highest, at 61 percent, with Sanders coming in second at 56 percent.
