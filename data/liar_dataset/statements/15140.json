Mark Harris came within 134 votes of beating U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger two years ago in the Republican primary for his seat, so he&rsquo;s trying again this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to close the voting gap before the May 8 primary, Harris is questioning Pittenger&rsquo;s conservative credentials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pittenger has represented North Carolina&rsquo;s 9th Congressional District since 2013, when he succeeded retiring Republican Sue Myrick. A Charlotte resident, Pittenger previously served in the state Senate and in 2008 ran unsuccessfully for Lt. Governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/victoryenterprises/an-important-announcement-from-mark-harris-550181?e=e90902704a\">recent newsletter</a>, Harris criticized Pittenger for supporting a spending bill that raised the debt ceiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Robert Pittenger showed us yet again why he is constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress,&quot; the newsletter says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 535 voting members of Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate). Republicans control Congress with nearly 300 seats: 238 in the House and 51 seats in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term &quot;most liberal&quot; is somewhat subjective. But PolitiFact wondered whether conservative watchdog groups have consistently singled out Pittenger as liberal since he won North Carolina&rsquo;s 9th Congressional district in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Harris campaign to see what ratings systems he&rsquo;s referencing in the newsletter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Harris said</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary source for the statement is a rating by <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/scorecard/\">Conservative Review</a>, according to Harris campaign spokesman Andy Yates. Conservative Review is a website founded by Mark Levin, a controversial radio personality who has referred to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell as a &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/346091-trump-threatens-mcconnell\">dummy</a>&quot; and &quot;failure.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Pittenger has a 55% F grade with them. It is the second worst grade of any NC Republican House member (McHenry is the worst),&quot; Yates said in an email, referring to Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents NC&rsquo;s 10th Congressional district. &quot;Pittenger has consistently graded out as an F with this group which marks him as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yates is right about Pittenger&rsquo;s standing among the 10 other North Carolina Republicans in the House. Whether that puts him among the most liberal Republicans depends on how one defines &quot;most liberal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Conservative Review&rsquo;s scorecard, there are about 90 House Republicans &ndash; about 36 percent &ndash; who have lower &quot;Liberty Scores&quot; than Pittenger. Among those with lower scores than Pittenger: House Speaker Paul Ryan and majority whip Steve Scalise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yates also cited Pittenger&rsquo;s 2018 rating with FreedomWorks, which is zero. FreedomWorks is a libertarian-leaning advocacy group. The scorecard mostly covers fiscal policy, civil liberties and regulatory issues, said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pye referred to Pittenger as &quot;unreliable&quot; when it comes to reining in spending. Pittenger &quot;generally votes with leadership, and they like to bust spending caps and bust the budget &mdash; things we&rsquo;re opposed to,&quot; Pye said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pittenger has a &quot;<a href=\"http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/robert-pittenger\">Lifetime Score</a>&quot; of 70 with the FreedomWorks. There are about 114 House members with <a href=\"http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators#party=Republican\">lower lifetime scores than Pittenger</a>. Pittenger&rsquo;s score places him slightly to the right of California Republican Devin Nunes and slightly to the left of U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, also of North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pittenger&rsquo;s lifetime ratings on FreedomWorks or Conservative Review aren&rsquo;t extremely liberal (or conservative.) To get a full picture of Pittenger&rsquo;s record, we consulted other sources as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What others said</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pittenger votes out-of-step with the majority of Republicans 5.5 percent of the time, according to <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/P000606-robert-pittenger\">ProPublica</a>. The group says that&rsquo;s close to the average for Republicans in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has a score of 90 percent with <a href=\"https://heritageaction.com/scorecard/members/p000606?session=115\">Heritage Action for America</a>, a watchdog group and think tank that says it &quot;turns conservative ideas into reality on Capitol Hill.&quot; The average score for House Republicans is 68 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a vote tracker on FiveThirtyEight.com, Pittenger&rsquo;s votes are aligned with Trump <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/robert-pittenger/\">96.9 percent of the time</a>. And there are dozens of Republican House members who <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/house/\">vote in-step with Trump</a> less than Pittenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has a perfect score with <a href=\"https://www.frcaction.org/get.cfm?c=FRCA_SCORECARD&amp;scorecard=scorecard_house\">FRC Action</a>, which advocates for conservative social issues. As of 2016, Pittenger also had an 88 lifetime rating with <a href=\"http://acuratings.conservative.org/acu-federal-legislative-ratings/?year1=2016&amp;chamber=12&amp;state1=46&amp;sortable=1\">The American Conservative Union</a>, another leading conservative organization. <a href=\"https://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/?chamber=0&amp;scyear=2017&amp;sort=lifescore&amp;sortdir=desc\">The Club For Growth</a>, which tracks legislation that affects the economy, gives Pittenger a lifetime score of 79 percent &ndash; which is in the middle-of-the-road for House Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://voteview.com/about\">VoteView.com</a>, meanwhile, says Pittenger is more conservative than <a href=\"https://voteview.com/person/21347/robert-pittenger\">68 percent of Republicans</a> in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be one thing if Harris said Pittenger isn&#39;t taking a strong enough stance on fiscal issues, even if it means voting against the party. Harris could make a case there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, &quot;to make the assertion that Pittenger is one of the most liberal Republicans is a stretch too far,&quot; said Michael Bitzer, chair of the politics department at Catawba College in Salisbury, NC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris said Pittenger is &quot;constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress.&quot; We can&rsquo;t find the results to back that up. So we rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-15T09:00:18.962560", "ruling_date": "2018-03-15T08:57:57", "ruling_headline": "Is Robert Pittenger among the 'most liberal' Republican congressmen?", "ruling_headline_slug": "robert-pittenger-among-most-liberal-republican-con", "ruling_link_text": "Not even close", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>A <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/victoryenterprises/an-important-announcement-from-mark-harris-550181?e=e90902704a\">newsletter</a> distributed Feb. 9 by the Mark Harris campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email correspondence with Andy Yates, spokesman for the Mark Harris campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email correspondence with Lawrence Shaheen, spokesman for the Robert Pittenger campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email correspondence with <a href=\"http://catawba.edu/academics/schools/arts-sciences/politics/faculty/bitzer/dr-j-michael-bitzer/\">Michael Bitzer</a>, chair of the politics department at Catawba College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A voting scorecard on <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/scorecard/\">ConservativeReview.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A voting scorecard on <a href=\"http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators#party=Republican\">FreedomWorks.com</a> and telephone interview with Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Story by The Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/346091-trump-threatens-mcconnell\">Trump Threatens McConnell</a>,&quot; published on Aug. 10, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A profile of Robert Pittenger on <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/P000606-robert-pittenger\">ProPublica.org</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A voting scorecard on <a href=\"https://heritageaction.com/scorecard/members/p000606?session=115\">HeritageAction.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A database on FiveThirtyEight.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/house/\">Tracking Congress In The Age Of Trump.</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A voting scorecard on <a href=\"https://www.frcaction.org/get.cfm?c=FRCA_SCORECARD&amp;scorecard=scorecard_house\">FRCaction.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rating by The American Conservative Union on its <a href=\"http://acuratings.conservative.org/acu-federal-legislative-ratings/?year1=2016&amp;chamber=12&amp;state1=46&amp;sortable=1\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A scorecard by The Club for Growth on its <a href=\"https://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/?chamber=0&amp;scyear=2017&amp;sort=lifescore&amp;sortdir=desc\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vote-tracker on <a href=\"https://voteview.com/person/21347/robert-pittenger\">VoteView.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "former pastor", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Mark", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "NC", "id": 4234, "last_name": "Harris", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "mark-harris", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/MarkHarrisMUG.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "North Carolina", "edition": "North Carolina", "edition_slug": "north-carolina", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 58, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The North Carolina Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/58/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4234/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.markharrisforcongress.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Rep.
