She has attended several space camps, according to <a href=\"https://www.brproud.com/news/local-news/baton-rouge-teen-training-to-be-the-first-human-on-mars/1310385524\">media reports</a>, and her Twitter name is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NASABlueberry1\">@NASABlueberry1</a>. Carson told the Baton Rouge, La., television station WVLA that NASA is &quot;definitely encouraging and supportive of what I&#39;m wanting to do, because they&#39;re encouraging of everyone who wants to become an astronaut.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson&rsquo;s father, Bert Carson, said in an article for Teen Vogue that private groups are also considering her into space. &quot;If we can find a mission for her in the next two years, she will be the first kid in the world to go to space,&quot; Bert Carson said. &quot;If we can get it together before she&rsquo;s 20, she&rsquo;ll be the first teenager.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scicademy headline, however, goes further suggesting NASA is prepping Carson for a trip to Mars. NASA spokesman Sean Potter told us that NASA &quot;has no official ties to Alyssa Carson.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline claims NASA is &quot;presping 17-year-old Alyssa Carson to become first human on Mars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson certainly wants to go into space.
