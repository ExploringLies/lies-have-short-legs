Estimates vary on the precise amount spent since the 2003 invasion, but two of the most credible sources, the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office, give the total as approximately $450 billion and $413 billion, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus, Dodd's assertion that U.S. spending in Iraq has already passed the half trillion dollar mark is slightly exaggerated, but that's a quibble.\n</p>\n<p>\n His overall point that spending on aid to Latin America is only a small fraction of Iraq spending is very much on target.\n</p>\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:37.581262", "ruling_date": "2007-09-14T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Correct, although money not yet appropriated", "ruling_headline_slug": "correct-although-money-not-yet-appropriated", "ruling_link_text": "Correct, although money not yet appropriated", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "U.S. State Department,\n<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/80151.pdf\">\n Fiscal 2008 Budget Request: International Affairs\n</a>\n<p>\n Congressional Research Service,\n <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf\">\n  The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global\r\nWar on Terror Operations Since 9/11\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Congressional Budget Office Testimony, July 31, 2007\n <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/84xx/doc8497/07-30-WarCosts_Testimony.pdf\">\n  Estimated Costs of U.S. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and of Other Activities Related to the War on Terrorism\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Connecticut", "id": 3, "last_name": "Dodd", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "chris-dodd", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-chrisdodd.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.chrisdodd.com/"}, "statement": "\"We're spending $1.6 billion for all of Latin America in terms of aid and assistance, a \r\nfraction of what we're spending in Iraq, the $500 billion we've spent there\"<p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate in Miami, Fla.", "statement_date": "2007-09-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
