Among them is D. Cole Phelps, an attorney running for state Senate in northeastern North Carolina&rsquo;s District 1 against Republican state Rep. Bob Steinburg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Labor Day, Phelps claimed in a Facebook post that health care premiums in North Carolina are among the most expensive in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Health care premiums in North Carolina are now among the five highest states in the country &mdash; and rural health care is struggling,&quot;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/phelpsforncsenate/posts/1177451305739754\">Phelps posted on Sept. 1</a>. &quot;Our opponent is protecting insurance company profits &mdash; not his constituents. As your state senator, I will fight for every person in Senate District One, including people with pre-existing conditions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are health insurance premiums in North Carolina higher than those in 45 other states? PolitiFact reached out to Phelps for the source of his information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support his claim, Phelps cited a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-best-health-care/23457\">WalletHub story</a>, &quot;The Best and Worst States for Healthcare.&quot; WalletHub, which looked at all 50 states and Washington, D.C., ranked North Carolina&rsquo;s health care system 47th for overall care. The Tar Heel State ranked 45th for average monthly insurance premiums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a key piece of information that&rsquo;s buried in the WalletHub story and that Phelps doesn&rsquo;t mention in his Facebook post: WalletHub only looked at health care plans through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It didn&rsquo;t take into account premiums for insurance plans acquired through employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to 2016 estimates by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html\">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. In North Carolina, employer-based plans covered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/nonelderly-0-64/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">52 percent of all non-Medicare recipients during 2016</a>, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health analysis organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with that in mind, we wondered whether North Carolinians are paying some of the highest premiums for health insurance plans across the board. Here&rsquo;s what we found for both customers in the ACA markets as well as on employer-sponsored plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>True, for ACA premiums</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to premiums for people with plans through the Affordable Care Act, Kaiser found that North Carolina had the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%222018%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">seventh-highest average benchmark premiums in 2018</a>. In 2017, NC had the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%222017%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">second-highest</a>. More than 478,000 people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/effectuated-marketplace-enrollment-and-financial-assistance/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Total%20Effectuated%20Marketplace%20Enrollment%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">enrolled in such plans in 2018</a>, KFF reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the average benchmark isn&rsquo;t an accurate reflection of what most customers pay, said Craig Palosky, KFF communications director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the benchmark shows the full sticker price, it&rsquo;s &quot;not what people who get tax credits would end up paying,&quot; Palosky said. &quot; The distinction is important because the vast majority of marketplace customers do get tax credits &ndash; 87 percent nationally and 94 percent in North Carolina.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/About-CMS.html\">CMS</a>, is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. David Anderson, a research associate for the Duke University Center for Health Policy, noted that the CMS risk adjustment formula found high average premiums in NC for 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At $501 a month, North Carolina in 2017 had the fourth-highest average premium in the individual market, Anderson noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erik Wengle, a research analyst for the Urban Institute Health Policy Center, said premiums for North Carolina&rsquo;s most popular ACA plans are &quot;frequently&quot; among the highest in the country. North Carolina&rsquo;s silver and gold ACA plans were both the fifth-most expensive in the country, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve found that competition is a large driver associated with lower premiums. NC hasn&rsquo;t had as robust competition as other states,&quot; Wengle said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only insurer to offer ACA plans&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/insurer-participation-on-aca-marketplaces/\">in all 100 NC counties</a>, while Cigna offers plans in Wake, Johnston, Orange, Chatham and Nash counties. Another insurer, Centene, is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article215665910.html\">expected to enter the Wake and Durham markets</a>&nbsp;next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not true for employer-based insurance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While North Carolina&rsquo;s government-subsidized plans are on the expensive side, PolitiFact couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence that NC&rsquo;s non-ACA premiums are among the highest in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser examines employer insurance data from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/quick_tables_results.jsp?component=2&amp;subcomponent=2&amp;year=2016&amp;tableSeries=-1&amp;tableSubSeries=CDE&amp;searchText=&amp;searchMethod=1&amp;Action=Search\">Medical Expenditure Panel Survey</a>, which collects data from insurance providers and is part of the U.S&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ahrq.gov/cpi/about/profile/index.html\">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KFF statistics from 2016 (the most recent year available) show that the average annual premium for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/single-coverage/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Total%20Annual%20Premium%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">single employee was $5,717</a>&nbsp;&mdash; one of the lowest averages in the country. Add a &quot;plus one&quot; (spouse or child) to the employee&rsquo;s coverage, and North Carolina still had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/employee-plus-one-coverage/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Total%20Annual%20Premium%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\">one of the lowest average premiums</a>&nbsp;in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, KFF found that premiums for employer-based family plans in NC were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/family-coverage/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Total%20Annual%20Premium%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">middle-of-the-road</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/summ_tables/insr/state/series_2/2017/tiic1.pdf\">2017 MEPS</a>&nbsp;show that the average employer-plan premium for an employee in North Carolina is slightly below the national average. For those plans, the annual North Carolina average was $6,348 a year while the national average was $6,368.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Phelps&rsquo; claim appears to be true for about 520,000 of North Carolinians on an ACA plan, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/final-weekly-enrollment-snapshot-2018-open-enrollment-period\" target=\"_blank\">CMS</a>. Going by the latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/nc\">Census estimates</a>, that&rsquo;s only 5 percent of North Carolina&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phelps said health insurance premiums in North Carolina &quot;are now among the five highest states in the country.&quot; He has a point when it comes to premiums for ACA plans. Those plans, however, only affect a fraction of North Carolina&rsquo;s population. Millions of North Carolinians have plans on the private market, and data show that private plans in NC aren&rsquo;t among the most expensive in the country. On balance, we rate Phelps&rsquo; claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters&rsquo; Lab and PolitiFact.
