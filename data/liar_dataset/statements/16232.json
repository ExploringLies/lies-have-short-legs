There&rsquo;s no evidence for the explosive second part about white men in chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Omar appeared on the The Daily Show with Trevor Noah in July 2017, then as a Minnesota state House representative. Omar filed to run for the U.S. Congress in June 2018 after Democratic U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison decided to run for the state&rsquo;s attorney general office instead of seeking re-election. On Nov. 6, Omar was elected to Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her Daily Show appearance, Noah told Omar she had a unique story, coming to the United States a refugee, being a Muslim, and a woman. &quot;You are everything that President Trump seems to be against. And you are in government. What&rsquo;s the plan?&quot; Noah asked Omar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am America&rsquo;s hope and the president&rsquo;s nightmare,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/video-clips/9v7o0u/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-ilhan-omar---fighting-for-a-better-life-for-all-americans---extended-interview\">Omar responded</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At no point in that interview did Omar say anything about white men in chains as slaves for not submitting to Islam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Omar also did not say in the <a href=\"http://time.com/collection/firsts/4898550/ilhan-omar-firsts/\">Time magazine interview</a>, even though the meme uses the photo from that interview.
