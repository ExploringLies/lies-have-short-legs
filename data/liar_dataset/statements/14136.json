Most of the presidents studied -- nine, starting with Coolidge and ending with George W. Bush -- oversaw inmate increases on their watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Schumer was cherry-picking data from the much smaller pool of federal inmates. In 2015, the number of inmates in state-run prisons was almost seven times larger than the number of federal inmates, and the total number of inmates in state and local facilities was more than than 10 times larger than the number in federal custody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we found that the same trends held for state and local inmate populations -- the number declined under Obama for the first time since at least the Carter years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the trend lines for state inmates (dark blue) and local inmates (lighter blue), which we compiled from federal prison statistics:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a credible argument can be made that Obama&rsquo;s policies made a difference in driving the decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/414/send-first-time-nonviolent-drug-offenders-to-rehab/\">reported</a>, Obama signed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/1789\">Fair Sentencing Act of 2010</a> into law. It dramatically reduced a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine. And his administration advocated for, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission approved, the retroactive application of some of the new sentencing guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, Sessions was among a number of Senate Republicans who spoke in favor of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. &quot;I will not favor alterations that massively undercut the sentencing we have in place, but I definitely believe that the current system is not fair and that we are not able to defend the sentences that are required to be imposed under the law today,&quot; he <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/politifact/obameter/drug-sentencing/\">said</a> in a 2009 Senate speech about the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he sees no significant omissions from Schumer&rsquo;s statement. &quot;The assertion is correct,&quot; Fox said. &quot;The reasons are partly strategic and partly being in the right office at the right time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;During Obama&#39;s administration, prosecutors were discouraged from seeking unnecessarily long prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders, a practice that the Trump administration wants to change. In addition, the cumulative impact of a declining crime rate had an impact on prison populations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer said, &quot;President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistics bear out Schumer&rsquo;s assertion, so we rate it True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-18T16:36:12.693422", "ruling_date": "2017-05-18T17:21:53", "ruling_headline": "Did federal inmate population drop under Obama for first time since Carter?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-federal-inmate-population-drop-under-obama-fir", "ruling_link_text": "The data is clear", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Charles Schumer, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?428720-1/us-senate-votes-associate-attorney-general-nomination&amp;start=940\">floor speech</a>, May 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/05/federal-prison-population-fell-during-obamas-term-reversing-recent-trend/\">Federal prison population fell during Obama&rsquo;s term, reversing recent trend</a>,&quot; Jan. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Justice Statistics, <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=kfdetail&amp;iid=487\">inmate population statistics index page</a>, accessed May 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/sessions-criminal-charging-memo/\">AG Sessions paves way for stricter sentencing in criminal cases</a>,&quot; May 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff Sessions, <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/05/12/ag.memo.on.department.charging.and.sentencing.policy.pdf\">memo to federal prosecutors</a>, May 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with James Alan Fox, criminologist at Northeastern University, May 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Justin Goodman, spokesman for Charles Schumer, May 18, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Charles", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "New York", "id": 138, "last_name": "Schumer", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "charles-schumer", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Schumer.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/138/", "total_count": 19, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Senate floor speech", "statement_date": "2017-05-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 177, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/177/", "subject": "Criminal Justice", "subject_slug": "criminal-justice", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Jeff", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Alabama", "id": 414, "last_name": "Sessions", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "jeff-sessions", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/sessions_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/414/", "total_count": 24, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": "Did federal inmate population drop under Obama for first time since Carter?"}
