Wouldn&rsquo;t St. Petersburg logically follow that trend?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, it does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjR_9M-1WtJTdHNOc0RUUzhRRXp5SXJXWjRpS0VBYkE&amp;usp=sharing\"><u>Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data</u></a> for the city of St. Petersburg, rough as they may be, do not support Kriseman&rsquo;s point. The numbers are taken from the government&rsquo;s monthly survey of 60,000 households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foster took office in January 2010, several months after the recession officially ended in <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/cycles.html\"><u>June 2009</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Foster took office, just over 103,000 St. Petersburg residents were working -- lower than it had been in any point since at least 2003, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjR_9M-1WtJTdHNOc0RUUzhRRXp5SXJXWjRpS0VBYkE&amp;usp=sharing\"><u>BLS data</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the most recent federal data for July 2013 show the number of people with jobs is up over 115,000. State data offer a more up-to-date figure, showing 116,127 employed residents for August. Granted, that&rsquo;s still short of the size of the city&rsquo;s workforce pre-recession. But it&rsquo;s certainly not a reduction from when Foster took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raymond James chief economist Scott Brown cautioned these figures are not consistent or fixed to match trends in population, &quot;but in general, you would expect to see some improvement because we tend to mirror the national and state economy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At the city level, especially St. Petersburg, little places like that are just slots in the overall economic cycle,&quot; Snaith said. &quot;They&rsquo;ve just got to ride what&rsquo;s happening. They&rsquo;re not going to be able to buck global and national swings that are just incredibly dramatic as they were in this cycle.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-17T15:07:48.941351", "ruling_date": "2013-10-17T16:59:28", "ruling_headline": "Rick Kriseman says fewer residents are working since Bill Foster took office", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-kriseman-says-fewer-residents-working-bill-fo", "ruling_link_text": "City rides national wave of recovery", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjR_9M-1WtJTdHNOc0RUUzhRRXp5SXJXWjRpS0VBYkE&amp;usp=sharing\"><u>Series data</u></a> for St. Petersburg from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Google doc)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Scott Brown, Raymond James chief economist, Oct. 16, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Sean Snaith, University of Central Florida professor and director of the Institute Economic Competitiveness, Oct. 16, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Stanley Smith, director of population studies at the University of Florida&rsquo;s Bureau of Economic and Business Research, Oct. 16, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jessica Sims, Florida Department of Economic Opportunity spokeswoman, Oct. 16, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Timothy Ewing, Bureau of Labor Statistics researcher, Oct. 17, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "State Representative", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 1440, "last_name": "Kriseman", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "rick-kriseman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rick-kriseman1a.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1440/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.kriseman.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Unfortunately, since Mr. Foster&#39;s been mayor ... there are less people employed in the city of St. Petersburg than there were prior to his taking office.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Tampa Bay Times/mayoral debate", "statement_date": "2013-10-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
