Martin O&rsquo;Malley, &quot;acknowledged that we are not better off than we were four years ago,&quot; Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Chris Devaney wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.tngop.org/wordpress/2012/09/04/tngop-monthly-review-9/\">posting</a> on the party&rsquo;s web site on Sept. 4.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back up the claim, the party&rsquo;s state executive director, Adam Nickas, directed us to O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s Sept. 2, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyh9gfznuEM\">appearance </a>on CBS News&rsquo; &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; The program, moderated by Bob Schieffer, was broadcast live on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead of paraphrasing the exchange in question, we&rsquo;ll let a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57504994/face-the-nation-transcripts-september-2-2012-omalley-cutter-richardson/?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">transcript </a>from that pertinent segment of the broadcast speak for itself:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSchieffer: Can you honestly say that people are better off today than they were four years ago?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Malley: No, but that&rsquo;s not the question of this election. The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses, the Bush recession, the Bush deficits, the series of desert wars, charged for the first time to credit cards, the national credit card &hellip;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Schieffer pointed out that Bush is not on the ballot, O&rsquo;Malley replied: &quot;Yeah. But we are making progress&quot; and are coming out of &quot;the deep, deep hole.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s remarks lit up the web and the blogosphere. But the next day, he gave a different answer during a CNN <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2012/09/03/exp-point-martin-omalley.cnn\">panel discussion </a>when moderator Soledad O&rsquo;Brien referenced his earlier response on &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, here is a transcript of the pertinent exchange:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Malley: Here&rsquo;s the reality of our situation as a country. We are clearly better off as a country because we are now creating jobs rather than losing them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Brien: But you said no &hellip;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Malley: But Soledad, we have not recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession. That&rsquo;s why we need to continue to move forward. Is there anybody on this panel that thinks we&rsquo;ve recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession? I don&rsquo;t think anybody could say that. But clearly, we&rsquo;re moving forward. We&rsquo;re creating jobs. Unemployment is down. Job creation is up. And those positive movements would not have happened without the president&rsquo;s leadership.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few days later, on Friday, Sept. 7, O&rsquo;Malley appeared on MSNBC&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48939473/ns/politics/t/md-gov-omalley-says-americans-are-better/\">&quot;Morning Joe&quot; </a>and said he didn&rsquo;t mean to say that Americans were not better off when he made his earlier remarks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Malley said he had been &quot;word-spliced&quot; on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and that Americans are indeed doing better.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yes, of course we&rsquo;re doing better when America is creating jobs, and we are creating jobs,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe again said the United States has not recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession and insisted that is what he was talking about on &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fairness to Devaney, O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s appearance on &quot;Morning Joe&quot; happened three days after Devaney had posted his comments on the GOP web site. But O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s CNN appearance, in which he backed off of his earlier statement, came the day before Devaney had posted his comments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring his &quot;Face the Nation&quot; appearance, O&rsquo;Malley did, in fact, say Americans are not better off than they were four years ago, but he made clear he felt this was the fault of the Bush administration, not Obama&rsquo;s. He further clarified his beliefs in a CNN interview the next day and in another television interview three days later. In those follow-up interviews, O&rsquo;Malley said that while not all jobs lost during the recession have been recovered, Americans are still better off because the country is creating jobs instead of losing them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChairman Devaney correctly cited O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s original remarks but failed to mention that the governor had said the opposite in subsequent interviews. We understand that, especially in the hyper-partisan atmosphere surrounding a presidential election, politicos are going to cherry-pick comments that make their side look good and the other guy look bad. Still, we rate Devaney&rsquo;s claim as Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-21T14:52:45.894674", "ruling_date": "2012-09-21T14:50:21", "ruling_headline": "Tennessee GOP chairman says Obama surrogate admits the country is not better off than four years ago", "ruling_headline_slug": "tennessee-gop-chairman-says-obama-surrogate-admits", "ruling_link_text": "He said it, but ...", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tChris Devaney, posting on Tennessee Republican Party web site, <a href=\"http://www.tngop.org/wordpress/2012/09/04/tngop-monthly-review-9/\">TNGOP Monthly Review</a>, Sept. 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdam Nickas, email to PolitiFact, Sept. 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Face the Nation,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyh9gfznuEM\">clip</a>from Martin O&rsquo;Malley appearance on Sept. 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Face the Nation,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57504994/face-the-nation-transcripts-september-2-2012-omalley-cutter-richardson/?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">transcript </a>from broadcast on Sept. 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2012/09/03/exp-point-martin-omalley.cnn\">video </a>of Martin O&rsquo;Malley appearance during panel discussion on Sept. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Associated Press, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48939473/ns/politics/t/md-gov-omalley-says-americans-are-better/\">Md.
