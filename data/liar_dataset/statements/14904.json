This story mimics earlier reports that have circulated for at least a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly before Trump&rsquo;s inauguration, a similar story surfaced on<a href=\"http://archive.is/KPe55\"> therightists.com</a> that said celebrities were calling for a strike within the movie industry in hopes that it would urge Trump to resign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/hollywood-strike-trump-resigns/\">Snopes</a> found that the rumor stemmed from an ad in the <em><a href=\"https://refusefascism.org/wp-content/uploads/nyt-no-16-1-4.pdf\">New York Times</a></em> by the group Refuse Fascism. The group, which included O&rsquo;Donnell, called for millions to hold a protest to &quot;create a political crisis that prevents the Trump/Pence fascist regime from consolidating its hold on the governance of society.&quot; <a href=\"https://refusefascism.org/2017/01/06/congress-certifies-trump-growing-1000s-say-no-vow-to-stop-trumppence-fascist-regime-before-it-starts/\">Thousands of people</a>, including musicians, actors, professors and authors, signed the petition as of Jan. 6, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The celebrities were not calling for a strike barring Trump&rsquo;s resignation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&#39;Donnell told <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/11/04/rosie_odonnell_ive_been_in_a_severe_depression_since_trump_won.html\">NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers</a> in November 2017 that she has been in a &quot;severe depression&quot; since Trump won the presidency and that she spends &quot;90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards&quot; Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pair have bad blood going back to O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s time on ABC&rsquo;s <em>The View</em>, when she criticized Trump on multiple personal and professional fronts after his decision not to fire a Miss USA accused of drug use and other wrongdoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We messaged O&rsquo;Donnell on Facebook to ask if she had threatened to strike and received an automated message: &quot;Please use my memes and articles as a resource to fight against Trump. I read all of my messages. #LoveTrumpsHate #ResistTrump Please don&#39;t leave hateful comments or memes on my page. Stay Rosie.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Nourtey.com said, &quot;Hollywood celebs: We will go on &lsquo;total strike&rsquo; if Trump does not resign.&quot; While O&rsquo;Donnell was among the celebrities who signed a Refuse Fascism petition calling for protests leading up to Trump&rsquo;s inauguration and has continued to criticize Trump, we found no evidence that there was a plan for a mass strike among celebrities.
