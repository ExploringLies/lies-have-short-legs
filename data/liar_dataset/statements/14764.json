He has said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should be listed as a terrorist organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, during a speech at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Monday, Gorka took it a step further in saying that militant groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State whose leaders are fundamentalist Sunni Muslims are less dangerous than Iran, led by fundamentalist Shiite Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The far larger threat to America is, in fact, Shia jihadism &ndash; meaning Iran, and meaning the mullahs. Not the people of Iran or Persians, but the Iranian Republican regime,&quot; Gorka said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why? &hellip; this is a regime which every Friday declares war on us &ndash; war and destruction. That America and Israel must be destroyed.&quot; He raised his voice to emphasize &quot;every Friday.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do Iran&rsquo;s leaders declare war on the United States &quot;every Friday,&quot; as Gorka suggests?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump and Iran&rsquo;s supreme leader have certainly engaged in a war of words recently, with Trump calling a branch of the Iranian armed forces the leader&rsquo;s &quot;corrupt personal terror force and militia.&quot; Ayatollah Ali Khamenei jabbed back, telling local media that Trump is &quot;foul-mouthed&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/19/middleeast/iran-khamenei-trump-foul-mouth/index.html\">pretends to be an idiot</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But PolitiFact wondered if it&rsquo;s possible that Iran has been at war with the United States. (We&nbsp;feel like we would&rsquo;ve heard about that by now.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Gorka by email and Twitter to ask what he meant. He doesn&rsquo;t appear to elaborate on Iran&rsquo;s war declarations in a <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155148169708437&amp;id=138516403436#_=_\">video</a> of the speech posted by the Christians United for Israel Facebook group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gorka responded by email after this fact check was published online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is this meant to be a joke?&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&lsquo;Death to America&rsquo; is not a declaration of war? According to your &lsquo;experts?&quot; he continued. &quot;Get real experts or just stop wasting my time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Death to America&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible &ndash; even likely &ndash; that Gorka was referring to Iranian officials chanting &quot;Death to America&quot; during Friday prayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time PolitiFact has looked into the chants of &quot;Death to America&quot; by Iranian officials, or the country&rsquo;s views on America. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2015 claimed that Iran celebrates &quot;Death to America Day&quot; every year &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/mar/13/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-iran-annually-has-death-america-holi/\">a claim we ruled Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty/gary-sick\">Gary Sick</a>, a scholar at Columbia University&rsquo;s Middle East Institute, told PolitiFact at the time that the chant &quot;is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran.&quot; In fact, experts say some Iranians have been chanting &quot;Death to America&quot; in Friday prayers for decades, dating back to the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/iran-hostage-crisis\">Iran hostage crisis</a> in 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As recently as August, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/df9effcf83a441528b845c8dfd426629\">Associated Press reported</a> that members of Iranian parliament chanted it when they voted to increase spending on the country&rsquo;s ballistic missile program and the foreign operations of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts say the chant isn&rsquo;t meant to project the country&rsquo;s intentions to physically harm Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interpreting chants</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foad Izadi, an assistant professor in the Faculty of World Studies at the University of Tehran, told <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-17/iran-death-america-doesn-t-mean-what-you-think-it-means\">Public Radio International in 2015</a> that the slogan should be interpreted as &quot;death to American foreign policy.&quot; Iranians &quot;have problems with the American government, not the American people,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevan Harris, assistant professor at UCLA and author of a book on Iranian politics, agreed: &quot;To me &ndash; and I&#39;ve been to the &lsquo;revolution day&rsquo; parades in Tehran as well as the Friday prayers in University of Tehran where the main political sermoning is given &ndash; it is political theater.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris compared it to Trump&rsquo;s claims in August that he&rsquo;ll unleash &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/world/asia/north-korea-un-sanctions-nuclear-missile-united-nations.html\">fire and fury</a>&quot; against North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States. Harris said there are &quot;lots of Iranian politicians&quot; who are moderates that favor diplomacy. But&nbsp;often the statements that make American news headlines are from &quot;some politician in Iran with a megaphone who is trying to outcompete his rivals by saying something scandalous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alireza Nader, senior policy analyst for the <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/about.html\">RAND Corporation</a>, echoed Harris&rsquo; view.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While hostile, this does not mean Iran is declaring war against the U.S. every Friday,&quot; Nader said. &quot;The U.S. and Iran may be rivals, but there is also a history of cooperation between the two as well, including on the nuclear issue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Declaring war</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to wish ill of your political enemies. It&rsquo;s another to formally declare war on another country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris, the UCLA professor, says Article 110 of the <a href=\"http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/constitutionislamic\">Iranian constitution</a> gives the powers of war to the supreme leader&rsquo;s office &ndash; which has not declared war on the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In reality, Iran&#39;s Supreme National Security Council makes decisions on foreign policy -- even Foreign Minister Zarif points this out when he&#39;s asked by journalists,&quot; Harris said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And PolitiFact couldn&#39;t find news reports of the supreme leader declaring war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could Iran&rsquo;s actions be interpreted as war? Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council, notes that Iranian money and resources are involved in battles across the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the U.S. State Department has listed Iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism for many years. Iran, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-still-top-state-sponsor-terrorism-u-s-report-says\">PBS reports</a>, has backed &quot;anti-Israel groups as well as proxies that have destabilized already devastating conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.&quot; The country has also &quot;continued to recruit in Afghanistan and Pakistan for Shiite militia members to fight in Syria and Iraq.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Marashi points out none of that activity means the country has declared war on the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s fair to point out that Iran has participated in proxy wars, like in Syria for example,&quot; Marashi said. &quot;But frankly in that regard they&rsquo;re no different than Saudi Arabia or even the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gorka said the Iranian regime &quot;declares war&quot; on America &quot;every Friday.&quot; The government-sanctioned prayers on Fridays sometimes include chants of &quot;death to America.&quot; Experts say those chants are rhetoric and not serious declarations of war. Iran has never formally declared war on the US even once, let alone on a weekly basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Gorka&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-16T18:35:23.894773", "ruling_date": "2017-11-16T18:19:17", "ruling_headline": "Former White House aide Gorka says Iran 'every Friday declares war on us'", "ruling_headline_slug": "fact-check-former-white-house-aide-says-iran-every", "ruling_link_text": "There's been chanting, but no declaration", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>A <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155148169708437&amp;id=138516403436#_=_\">video</a> of the speech posted by the Christians United for Israel Facebook group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email correspondence with <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/about/people/n/nader_alireza.html\">Alireza Nader</a>, Senior Policy Analyst for the RAND Corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email correspondence with Kevan Harris, <a href=\"http://www.soc.ucla.edu/faculty/kevan-harris\">assistant professor at UCLA</a> and author of the book &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520280823\">A Social Revolution: Politics and the Welfare State in Iran</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview with <a href=\"https://mborouje.expressions.syr.edu/\">Mehrzad Boroujerdi</a>, professor of political science at Syracuse and visiting fellow at California State University &ndash; Northridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview with <a href=\"https://www.niacouncil.org/about-niac/staff-board/reza-marashi/\">Reza Marashi</a>, research director at the National Iranian American Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments made to PolitiFact in 2015 by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty/gary-sick\">Gary Sick</a>, a scholar at Columbia University&rsquo;s Middle East Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/df9effcf83a441528b845c8dfd426629\">story by the Associated Press</a> on Aug. 13: &quot;Iran lawmakers raise missile, Guard spending to challenge US&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-17/iran-death-america-doesn-t-mean-what-you-think-it-means\">story by Public Radio International</a> on Aug. 15, 2015: &quot;In Iran, &lsquo;death to America&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean what you think it means&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-still-top-state-sponsor-terrorism-u-s-report-says\">PBS story</a> on July 17 on the U.S. State Department&#39;s 2017 &quot;Country Reports on Terrorism&quot;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Deputy assistant to the president", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Sebastian", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 3997, "last_name": "Gorka", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "sebastian-gorka", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gorkamug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3997/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://whitehouse.gov"}, "statement": "<p>Iran&rsquo;s regime &quot;every Friday declares war on us.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at UNC-Chapel Hill", "statement_date": "2017-11-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 330, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/330/", "subject": "Iran", "subject_slug": "iran", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/58/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Former Trump aide Gorka says Iran 'declares war' on America 'every Friday'"}
