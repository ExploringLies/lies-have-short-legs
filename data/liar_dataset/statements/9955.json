I wonder what mine is worth?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An updated version is making the rounds again, urging people to vote this November. A<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/\"> PolitiFact Oregon </a>reader received it from an acquaintance and passed it along to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The claim:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email focuses on Robinson, who is first lady Michelle Obama&rsquo;s brother and <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/#get-the-latest\">President Barack Obama&rsquo;</a>s brother-in-law. The piece alleges that Oregon State officials in 2010 were &quot;seriously considering&quot; firing Robinson after his team&rsquo;s &quot;dismal&quot; start to the 2009-10 basketball season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When word reached Washington, D.C.,&quot; it continues, &quot;<a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/news/staff/bios/kanter.html\">Undersecretary of Education Martha Kanter</a> was dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university. Craig Robinson&rsquo;s job is safe for another year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It notes the first family connections and closes: &quot;If this doesn&rsquo;t anger you, nothing will &hellip; remember to vote this fall!!!!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The analysis:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crux of the claim involves the charge that Bob DeCarolis, Oregon State&rsquo;s athletic director, was preparing to fire Robinson after a &quot;dismal 8-11 start (2-5) in the Pac 10 Conference.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The university changed its mind, supposedly, only after Kanter, formerly the Obama administration&rsquo;s highest-ranking higher education official, was &quot;dispatched&quot; to Corvallis with oodles of stimulus money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We called Steve Clark, OSU&rsquo;s vice president for university relations and marketing. &quot;It&rsquo;s interesting that it comes up again now,&quot; he said, &quot;just a few months before the elections.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for stimulus money -- from the <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/arra/Pages/default.aspx\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a>, passed by Congress and signed by Obama after the 2008 onset of the Great Recession -- Oregon State did receive some.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As did public universities throughout the nation,&quot; Clark said. OSU&rsquo;s share totaled $26.4 million. &quot;That funded 61 research projects and some infrastructure,&quot; he added, &quot;all associated with issues consistent with Oregon State&rsquo;s research mission.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a problem of timing surfaces immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Oct. 12, 2009, OSU had already received and spent $17.8 million in stimulus money, <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2009/10/most_stimulus_jobs_in_educatio.html\">according to a story</a> by education reporter Betsy Hammond of the Oregonian (the remainder was spent later, on a rolling basis).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s likely where the $17 million referred to in the chain email came from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when OSU&rsquo;s 2009-10 basketball season came along, that money was already gone. The Beavers didn&rsquo;t get to two wins and five losses in league play -- the point at which DeCarolis, according to the email, was mulling firing Robinson -- until their Jan. 23, 2010, road loss to California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should also be noted that the funds came through the <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/recovery/factsheet/stabilization-fund.html\">State Fiscal Stabilization Fund</a>, a program set up to help educational institutions retain top teachers and professors. Individual states, not the federal government, chose the recipients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed Kanter, <a href=\"http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty_bios/view/Martha_Kanter\">now a visiting professor at New York University Steinhardt.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have no idea where this rumor stems from,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I never traveled to Corvallis to award $17 million in stimulus money in 2010, nor do I personally know Craig Robinson.&quot; She also provided a link to another fact-checking site that debunked the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OSU officials said they have no record of Kanter showing up in Corvallis around that time, nor is there any evidence of news stories detailing a trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeCarolis has flatly denied the story several times. It would also be highly unusual for any major college program to fire a coach so early in a season, especially considering that Robinson&rsquo;s team the year before finished with an 18-18 win-loss record and earned OSU&rsquo;s first post-season championship by winning the 2009 College Basketball Invitational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Robinson, the run didn&rsquo;t last forever. DeCarolis fired him May 5, 2014, after six seasons and a win-loss record of 94-105.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ruling:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recycled chain email claims OSU basketball coach Craig Robinson -- Michelle Obama&rsquo;s brother and the president&rsquo;s brother-in-law -- avoided losing his job in March 2010 only because a high-ranking administration official was &quot;dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Records show that OSU had spent $17.8 million in stimulus funds months before the point when Robinson&rsquo;s job was supposedly on the line. And there is no evidence that an administration official was &quot;dispatched&quot; to Corvallis. The state, not the feds, also chose how to spend the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/oregonstate.asp\"> has been debunked repeatedly</a>, but keeps cropping up with nothing changed but the date. It&rsquo;s not only false, but ridiculously so.
