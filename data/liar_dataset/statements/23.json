(Think of your son/daughter marrying your cousin's daughter/son.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Giuliani at different points labeled the family connection as \"second cousins once removed\" and \"third cousins,\" before he was corrected, according to news reports.\r\n\r\nIn a 1993 memo for his mayoral campaign, a Giuliani strategist noted the \"weirdness\" factor of the marriage, according to a copy posted on the Smoking Gun Web site. But such a marriage is completely legal. In New York, even first cousins can wed.\r\n\r\nRobin Bennett, senior genetic counselor at the University of Washington, said little scientific research exists about the risk of developmental difficulties for the offspring of second cousins. But she said, \"for second cousins, the risks are likely similar to the risks of couples from the same ethnic population who also may have common ancestors.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Giuliani and Peruggi did not have any children, and the marriage ended after 14 years.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:38.549281", "ruling_date": "2007-09-06T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Giuliani's first wife was his second cousin", "ruling_headline_slug": "giulianis-first-wife-was-his-second-cousin", "ruling_link_text": "Giuliani's first wife was his second cousin", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Interviews with Robin Bennett, senior genetic counselor at the University of Washington.\n<p>\n The Los Angeles Times: May 7, 2007 \"Private lives and public tolerance; Giuliani, with two marriages and a messy divorce behind him, hopes the post-Clinton era will be kind to him.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E4D61E3FF93AA25753C1A961958260\">\n  New York Times, \"RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Republican Candidate; A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey\"\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18108978/\">\n  The Associated Press, \"Rudy Giuliani in a dress: Will voters care?\"\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n The Smoking Gun,\n <a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0212072giuliani1.html\">\n  Rudy Giuliani's \"Vulnerabilities\" Memo\n </a>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 21, "last_name": "Obama Girl", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "obama-girl", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-obamagirl.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/21/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "\"At least Obama didn't marry his cousin,\" as Giuliani did.
