Kyrsten Sinema voted to weaken the federal agency responsible for executing immigration laws within the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a dangerous agenda coming out of the Democrats, and again my opponent voted to cut ICE. ... I support ICE and my opponent voted for cuts to ICE, voted not to support the Department of Homeland Security,&quot; McSally said in the interview that aired Sept. 16. &quot;She is associated with this dangerous agenda, don&rsquo;t be fooled by it. And that&rsquo;s a real contrast in this race as well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McSally is on the House Homeland Security Committee and chairs the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it true that Sinema &quot;voted to cut ICE&quot;?

That amendment, sponsored by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., sought to reduce ICE funding by $100 million and give that money to the U.S. Coast Guard. (The amendment failed.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correa argued on the House floor that the Coast Guard should use the money for additional ships to interdict drugs coming to the United States by sea. Despite record-breaking efforts against drug trafficking, the Coast Guard&rsquo;s cocaine seizures accounted for less than 10 percent of all attempted shipments, Correa said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $100 million represented &quot;additional support for our border security, our high seas,&quot; Correa <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?433518-3/house-session-part-2&amp;start=36849\">said</a>. He was responding to Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, who argued that the Coast Guard program was already robust and ICE money should go toward the detention of immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sinema&rsquo;s campaign argued that the $100 million redirection would have reduced an overall increase in ICE funding, but not necessarily cut it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That September, Sinema also voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll527.xml\">in favor of a motion</a> introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, to recommit a bill to the House Appropriations Committee. The intention was to get the committee to amend the bill by allocating $2.4 billion to FEMA&rsquo;s National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://jacksonlee.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-sheila-jackson-lee-offers-motion-to-recommit-to-protect\">About $840 million</a> would have come from ICE&rsquo;s budget and $1.6 billion from U.S. Customs and Border Protection&#39;s allocation for border barriers. (The motion failed.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson Lee argued that instead of funding a border wall and ICE detention facilities, more money was needed for pre-disaster funding, especially in light of Hurricane Harvey&#39;s aftermath in Texas and Louisiana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention centers; but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters,&quot; <a href=\"https://jacksonlee.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-sheila-jackson-lee-offers-motion-to-recommit-to-protect\">said</a> Jackson Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Sinema&rsquo;s counter argument</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of those votes, Sinema&rsquo;s spokeswoman Helen Hare said McSally&rsquo;s claim ignores a big part of the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sinema <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1625/actions\">voted in favor</a> of a <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R44919.pdf\">10 percent</a> funding increase for ICE, compared to fiscal year 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sinema over her years in Congress also has <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll211.xml\">voted </a><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/244\">in favor</a><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/actions\"> of other appropriation bills</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/83/actions\">funding</a><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3547/actions\"> ICE</a>, her campaign said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Sinema was one of 18 Democrats who <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/990/titles\">voted in favor</a> of a July resolution stating explicit support for ICE officers and personnel&nbsp;and denouncing calls to abolish the agency.
