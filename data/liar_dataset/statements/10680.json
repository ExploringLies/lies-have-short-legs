At least 45 states already allow such sales, mostly in response to the growing popularity of breweries and brew pubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Versions of the beer bill (Senate Bill 63) have cleared the Senate and House. But the much-talked-about bill won&rsquo;t make it to the desk of the governor this year unless the Senate signs off today on House changes &mdash; including a March 23 subcommittee move that killed efforts to allow to-go sales at brew pubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That followed testimony from Martin Smith, a lobbyist for the Georgia Beer Wholesalers, that opening the door to such sales could result in giant conglomerates dominating the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you allow producers to have access and allow retail, you allow that slide into what happens in the rest of the world where large producers own everything,&quot; Smith testified. &quot;In Mexico, 90 percent of the market is controlled by one entity. It allows the manufacturer to own the retail.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia wondered, was Smith right to suggest that allowing brew pubs to sell beer for off-site consumption would set the stage for a tightly controlled beer market on par with Mexico&rsquo;s? We decided to take a deeper look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a little background about this country&#39;s craft brewing as well as the Mexico beer market. Small and independent craft brewers in the United States reported producing 22.2 million barrels of beer in 2014, worth about $19.6 billion, or about 19 percent of an otherwise flat national beer sales network. The criticism of the Mexican beer market for years was that it effectively had largely two players and a duopoly, Modelo (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev) and FEMSA (owned by Heineken).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith told PolitiFact that his comments about the Mexican beer market came in response to a lawmaker&rsquo;s question. (He also clarified that he wrongly told the committee there was one major producer in Mexico, rather than two.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith said he was describing the advantages of America&rsquo;s three-tier system of beer industry brewers, distributors and retailers, which some consider the most powerful antitrust measure ever established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It provides equal market access for all brewers as the system restricts producers from controlling shelves or taps at retail, thus preventing market domination by a few producers,&quot; Smith said in an email. &quot;I referenced Mexico as an example of a country where producers are allowed to directly control the retail market, and thus two producers control 90 percent of the beer market, which essentially blocks out all new, small, &lsquo;craft&rsquo; producers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, Craig Purser, president of the National Beer Wholesalers Association. said policymakers&nbsp; &quot;need only look to America&rsquo;s neighbor to the south, Mexico, to see what can happen without a three-tier system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot; As Joni Mitchell sang, &quot;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;til it&rsquo;s gone,&quot; Purser wrote in a column.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bart Watson, the chief economist for the Colorado-based Brewers Association, the craft brewers trade association, called the Mexico argument &quot;a red herring.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument is one the National Beer Wholesalers Association constantly uses to try to forestall even minor changes to the three-tier system, Watson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Georgia&rsquo;s proposed changes &quot;are small, reasonable and would likely be beneficial for the state and consumers,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watson said there&rsquo;s no evidence that any state &mdash; including Georgia &mdash; has or would develop into a Mexico with only a couple of producers dominating the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All states that allow brew pub to-go sales have limits on production, sales or most often both, Watson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least 42 states allow &quot;to-go&quot; brew pub sales, said Nancy Palmer, the executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four &mdash; Georgia, Alabama, Florida and New Mexico &mdash; don&rsquo;t allow customers to leave with beer in a resealable container, Watson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in the states with what are considered the laxest laws, the result has been more, not less, consumer choice, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The NBWA&rsquo;s opposition to these laws by comparing them to what has happened in Mexico is nonsensical,&quot; Watson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palmer, from the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, said the Mexico argument &quot;is just one in a series of straw-man arguments that the wholesalers and their crew of lobbyists use to confuse, obfuscate and distract from the actual issues at hand.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia&rsquo;s proposed law has strict sales limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As introduced, it would allow breweries to sell up to 72 ounces per person per day on-site and up to a 12-pack to go. It would lift a prohibition on bottling by brew pubs, which are now restricted to making draft beer only, and allow them to have to-go sales of up to 144 ounces of beer per day per person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate version bars brewery sales but would allow them to sell tours and give away &quot;free tastings&quot; of up to 36 ounces per person per day, plus a &quot;free souvenir&quot; of 64 ounces in a to-go container.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ruling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vast majority of states have allowed breweries and brew pubs to sell directly to their consumers in a segment of the beer market that is flourishing. There&rsquo;s no evidence that they could become consumer-unfriendly market-rulers under existing state laws or Georgia&#39;s proposed law. To say otherwise is beyond a stretch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-01T17:20:48.752399", "ruling_date": "2015-04-02T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Fact-checkers find beer will not transform Georgia into Mexico", "ruling_headline_slug": "fact-checkers-find-beer-will-not-transform-georgia", "ruling_link_text": "Beer is big business", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&#39;&#39;Beer jobs&#39;
