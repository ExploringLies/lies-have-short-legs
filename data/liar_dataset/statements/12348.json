So we felt compelled to look into a statement by Joe Roman, the CEO and president of the <a href=\"http://www.gcpartnership.com/\">Greater Cleveland Partnership</a>, a regional pro-business organization, on a proposal to raise the city&rsquo;s minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 25, the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em> reported that <a href=\"http://raiseupcleveland.com/\">Raise Up Cleveland</a>, a union-affiliated PAC, delivered<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ma3z7tygMo\"> 28,000 signatures</a> to the city council from registered Cleveland voters who support a minimum wage of $15 per hour. The current minimum wage across Ohio is $8.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have serious concerns about a Cleveland-only wage hike that could put the city in a competitive disadvantage in the region and state,&quot; Roman said, according to the <em>Plain Dealer</em>. &quot;As proposed, the hike is the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National awareness of the movement called Fight for $15 has been boosted by Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and $15 minimum wage increases have been enacted by cities in California, Washington and New York. So what could make the Cleveland proposal the &quot;most aggressive?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we found out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judith Malone, the director of communications at the Greater Cleveland Partnership, sent us this statement, expanding upon the CEO&rsquo;s definition of &quot;most aggressive:&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>According to our examination, no other municipality or state has enacted a +80% increase in their minimum wage. If passed, Cleveland would have the highest broadly applied municipal minimum wage in the nation on January 1, 2017....If the current proposal is approved, Cleveland&rsquo;s minimum wage would be two times higher than 24 states in the nation and by far the highest in the Midwest region.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chart created by the left-leaning National Employment Law Project backs up this claim. A $15 per hour minimum wage has been enacted by the Washington cities of Seattle, SeaTac (a suburb of Seattle that&nbsp;went to $15.24 in 2013) and Olympia. California cities that approved the $15 minimum include San Francisco, Emeryville, Los Angeles, Mountain View, El Cerrito and Santa Monica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As proposed, the Raise Up Cleveland increase would go into effect Jan. 1, 2017. This is a departure from the way other states and cities have imposed new minimum wage hikes, according to Allison Laffen, a policy associate with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which studies state labor and wage policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Often in legislation, the increases are proposed incrementally, as in New York and California, where it reaches $15 by 2018 and 2022,&quot; Laffen said. &quot;A one-step increase to $15, effective immediately, could be described as more aggressive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laffen also pointed out that Cleveland&rsquo;s minimum wage, at $8.10, is lower than any other municipality that has passed or is considering a $15 minimum hike. Only Flagstaff, Arizona, at $8.05, is lower than Cleveland&rsquo;s, and their $15 per hour proposal would phase in by 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the low cost of living in Cleveland is another factor to consider. For example, the cost of living in San Francisco is &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/cleveland-oh/san-francisco-ca/25000\">206 percent</a> pricier than in Cleveland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A $15 minimum wage in a city like San Francisco would only be equivalent to about a $5 minimum wage in Cleveland,&quot; Perry said. &quot;Therefore, adjusted for the cost of living, it would be hard to justify a $15-an-hour minimum wage in a city like Cleveland, with a cost-of-living that is about 20 percent below the national average.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the union pushing the Fight for $15 in Cleveland defends its stance. Anthony Caldwell, the director of public affairs for SEIU District 1199, said in an email, &quot;Our Fight for $15 movement has broad support among members of the community. When <a href=\"http://ohio.onlineactions.org/page/-/20160419_LRP_Memo_RaiseUpCleveland.pdf\">polled on support for a $15 per hour minimum wage</a> beginning this January and indexing it to inflation, 77 percent of Cleveland voters supported our cause. And that support crossed all racial, gender and geographical lines within Cleveland.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked whether the Greater Cleveland Partnership would be more supportive of a minimum wage increase that stepped up gradually, or was more in line with Cleveland&rsquo;s cost of living, they declined to comment further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proposed $15 minimum wage in Cleveland is the &quot;most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country,&quot; according to the head of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, a chamber of commerce group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that Cleveland, with a minimum wage of $8.10, is at the lowest starting point of any municipality that has passed or is considering a $15 hike. &nbsp;Also, the Cleveland proposal would increase the wage to $15 at once instead of building up gradually, as most other cities have done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e1eee872-2aa8-40b6-860e-9ce97fbe2ca3\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e1eee872-2aa8-40b6-860e-9ce97fbe2ca3</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-06T15:40:35.443332", "ruling_date": "2016-05-09T14:24:30", "ruling_headline": "$15-per-hour proposal in Cleveland 'most aggressive' increase in US?", "ruling_headline_slug": "15-minimum-wage-proposal-cleveland-most-aggressive", "ruling_link_text": "\"Grrr!\" goes the minimum wage", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Mark Perry, American Enterprise Institute, May 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Allison Laffen, National Conference of State Legislatures, May 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Marty McGann, Greater Cleveland Partnership, May 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fact sheet, &quot;City Minimum Wage Laws: Recent Trends and Economic Evidence,&quot;
