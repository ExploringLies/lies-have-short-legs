Next, you see Hurd, talking on MSNBC&rsquo;s Morning Joe, saying: &quot;A wall absolutely makes sense.&quot; Text under the snippet says: &quot;Rep. Hurd Talks Trump&rsquo;s Idea to Build A Wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hold on there. Far as we can tell, Hurd has stopped far short of saluting Trump&rsquo;s championed border-long wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a March 2016 interview with the <em>San Antonio Express-News</em>, <a href=\"http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/A-Trump-nomination-could-have-congressional-6923792.php\">Hurd said</a>: &quot;Building a wall is the most expensive, least effective way to do border security.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Gallego&rsquo;s campaign for factual backup of the idea that Hurd is aboard with Trump on a border-long wall, campaign spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez initially declared by email that Gallego &quot;never said that Rep. Hurd backs Trump&rsquo;s border wall.&quot; Rather, she wrote, &quot;our ad states that they share many of the same bad ideas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Rodriguez later said: &quot;What we are saying in the ad is they both support some form of the wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rodriguez also provided a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8wi4mrtettrk92/9.08.15%20Hurd%20MSNBC%20Interview.mp4?dl=0\">web link to a video excerpt</a> from the MSNBC interview in which Hurd talked about a wall. The 10-second excerpt shows Joe Scarborough, a host of the Morning Joe show, saying: &quot;Why do they all resort to that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, you need a wall in some places, all right,&quot; Hurd replied. &quot;In heavily populated places, a wall absolutely makes sense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took our own look at the full <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/texas-congressman-refutes-trumps-wall-idea-520884291875\">Sept. 8, 2015 </a>Morning Joe interview of Hurd, which was pointed out to us by Hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Headlined &quot;Texas congressman refutes Trump&rsquo;s wall idea,&quot; MSNBC&#39;s five-minute video shows Hurd endorsing a border wall in heavily populated places. But he otherwise was clear about a border-long wall not making sense--meaning Gallego&rsquo;s ad misrepresented Hurd&rsquo;s declared view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our transcript below begins with Scarborough asking Hurd about how much of the border with Mexico is in the 23rd Congressional District he represents:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCARBOROUGH: &quot;I want to start with Donald Trump&rsquo;s wall. So (addressing Hurd) you have, what, 800 miles--&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HURD: &quot;Over 800 miles--&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCARBOROUGH: &quot;--bordering Mexico.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HURD: &quot;Right.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCARBOROUGH: &quot;So tell me what you think when you hear Donald Trump and other people talking about building a giant wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HURD: &quot;You can&rsquo;t build a wall from sea to shining sea, it just doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s the most expensive way to do border security and it&rsquo;s the least effective.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A moment later, Hurd said: &quot;What we need to do is we need to allow the men and women in Border Patrol to adjust their tactics, techniques and procedures as they see fit. You can&rsquo;t have a one-size-fits-all solution in San Diego. It&rsquo;s not going to necessarily work in Tucson and you need something different in El Paso.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCARBOROUGH: &quot;Right, so why is it, though, that Republican candidates always--remember, John McCain turned to the cameras and said, &lsquo;Build the dang wall.&rsquo; Why do they all resort to that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HURD: &quot;Well, you need a wall in some places, all right. In heavily populated places, a wall absolutely makes sense. A wall is just one more tool in your toolkit in order to solve the problem.&quot; Hurd went on to stress his support for closer collaboration with &quot;some of our Mexican partners on the other side.&quot; Hurd also said the U.S. needs to make countering the drug cartels and human smuggling efforts a national priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an ad, Gallego accuses Will Hurd of declaring that a border-long U.S.-Mexico wall &quot;absolutely makes sense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Hurd has twice spurned Trump&rsquo;s idea. Still, he told MSNBC a wall makes sense in heavily populated places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Gallego&rsquo;s claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
