Islanders mostly tend to head to&nbsp;the mainland, however, countries in Latin America, the Dominican Republic and Spain have been attracting Puerto Ricans as well. So the total number of migrants leaving the island is actually larger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent qualitative interviews by researchers from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies found that the people leaving Puerto Rico in the greatest numbers are nurses, paramedics, police officers, teachers, college professors and lawyers. They are often recruited and going to states with growing Hispanic populations in need of bilingual professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surge in departures has led to the&nbsp;social media tag&nbsp;#yonomequito (&quot;I am not going anywhere&quot;).

Airline data suggests about 89,000 more people departed Puerto Rico for the United States then entered it in 2015. While that&rsquo;s not a perfect estimate to measure out-migration, all the population trends suggest Puerto Rico is experiencing a surge in out-migration, as residents leave for better jobs and prospects in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lew&rsquo;s statement is Mostly True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/560a7d4a-b482-4617-b070-ebed036363f7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/560a7d4a-b482-4617-b070-ebed036363f7</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-16T16:53:47.761527", "ruling_date": "2016-05-17T10:38:46", "ruling_headline": "Treasury Secretary Lew says about 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year", "ruling_headline_slug": "treasury-secretary-lew-says-about-100000-people-le", "ruling_link_text": "Lots of 1-way tickets out", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Government Development of Puerto Rico, <a href=\"http://www.gdbpr.com/documents/PuertoRicoAWayForward.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Puerto Rico: A&nbsp;Way Forward</u></a>, June 29, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/state-to-state-migration.html \" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>State-to-State Migration Flows</u></a>, accessed on May 16, 2016 &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation statistics, <a href=\"http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Passengers, All carriers - All Airports</u></a>, and email interviews with David Smallen&nbsp;and Connie Tang, Public Affairs Office, May 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/24/historic-population-losses-continue-across-puerto-rico/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Historic population losses continue across Puerto Rico</u></a>, March 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Treasury, <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/We-Must-Avoid-Another-Lost-Decade-in-Puerto-Rico.aspx \" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>We Must Avoid Another Lost Decade in Puerto Rico</u></a>, February 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Harry Franqui-Rivera, historian, Center for Puerto Rican Studies, Hunter College, City University of New York, May 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Jens Manuel Krogstad, editor, Pew Research Center, May 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Daniel Watson, spokesman, U.S. Treasury Department, May 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Virginia Hyer, spokeswoman, U.S. Census Bureau, May 11, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Treasury secretary ", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Jack", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.
