Evan Jenkins, and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Each is running for the nomination to face Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in the general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll fact-check one of several assertions Morrisey made about Jenkins&rsquo; past Democratic affiliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/patrick-morrisey/do-joe-manchin-and-evan-jenkins-support-clinton-ca/\">previously noted</a>, Jenkins was initially registered as a Democrat, then switched to Republican, then back to Democratic when he sought a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he became a Republican to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate, Morrisey addressed Jenkins and said, &quot;You said your philosophy was &lsquo;progressive mainstream&rsquo; back in 2003.&quot; (It&rsquo;s at about the 5:10 mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gJDjPnvLvo\">here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Jenkins did use those words, although Morrisey glossed over some context about the comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey&rsquo;s camp pointed us to an Aug. 13, 2003, article in the <em>Herald-Dispatch </em>newspaper of Huntington, W. Va. The article addressed West Virginia&rsquo;s 2004 gubernatorial election, in which incumbent Democratic Gov. Bob Wise declined to seek another term. Manchin easily won the Democratic primary and the governorship that fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the headline, &quot;Some say governor is right not to run,&quot; the story quotes Jenkins about the still-developing candidate field for the governorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Jenkins was a Democratic state senator. Here&rsquo;s the relevant part:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;This is an opportunity for Democrats, who I hope will put forth a nominee who can chart a course that gets away from the politics of the past and talk about addressing some of our tough economic development challenges,&quot; Jenkins said. &quot;I hope the end result is a candidate who will talk about progressive mainstream issues and not talk about coalition building of special interest groups. I think voters in the mainstream are tired of politics of the past and ready for some new, strong leadership.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Jenkins definitely said the words &quot;progressive mainstream.&quot; But Morrisey&rsquo;s characterization of the comments are somewhat off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenkins didn&rsquo;t exactly say the term described his own &quot;own philosophy,&quot; as Morrisey charged during the debate. Rather, Jenkins was using the phrase to describe the philosophy a hypothetical gubernatorial candidate might pursue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that, unlike today, the term &quot;progressive&quot; was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/02/05/465671983/democrats-debate-what-is-a-progressive-and-who-wants-to-be-one\">not used as widely</a> as a near-synonym for &quot;liberal&quot; back in 2003. The specific policies that Jenkins mentioned in the 2003 exchange were not ones considered central to the &quot;progressive&quot; agenda today, such as abortion rights and gun control, but rather economic development, which is not an issue with support that&rsquo;s exclusive to either the left or the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the overall gist of Jenkins&rsquo; remarks focuses on ditching the &quot;politics of the past&quot; and not kowtowing to &quot;special interest groups.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey said to Jenkins, &quot;You said your philosophy was &lsquo;progressive mainstream&rsquo; back in 2003.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenkins did use those words in an aspirational tone for a&nbsp;2003 newspaper article. But Jenkins was talking about issues a hypothetical Democratic gubernatorial candidate should run on, not his own political philosophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-02T14:01:10.378165", "ruling_date": "2018-05-02T18:02:12", "ruling_headline": "Did Evan Jenkins once say his philosophy was 'progressive mainstream'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-evan-jenkins-once-say-his-philosophy-was-progr", "ruling_link_text": "Some context missing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gJDjPnvLvo\">West Virginia Senate debate part 3</a>, May 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/02/05/465671983/democrats-debate-what-is-a-progressive-and-who-wants-to-be-one\">Democrats Debate: What Is A Progressive And Who Wants To Be One?</a>&quot; Feb. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/patrick-morrisey/do-joe-manchin-and-evan-jenkins-support-clinton-ca/\">Do Joe Manchin and Evan Jenkins support Clinton, cap-and-trade, Planned Parenthood and tax hikes?</a>&quot; Nov. 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Nachama Soloveichik, spokeswoman for Patrick Morrisey, May 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Andy Ser&eacute;, spokesman for Evan Jenkins, May 2, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Patrick", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 4088, "last_name": "Morrisey", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "patrick-morrisey", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/morrisey_photo.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/morrisey_photo.jpg", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4088/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;You (Evan Jenkins) said your philosophy was &lsquo;progressive mainstream&rsquo; back in 2003.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate", "statement_date": "2018-05-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Evan", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 4079, "last_name": "Jenkins", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "evan-jenkins", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/jenkins.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4079/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": "Did Evan Jenkins once say his philosophy was 'progressive mainstream'?"}
