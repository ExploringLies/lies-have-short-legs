And there are smaller measures, like creating working groups and encouraging local leaders to commit to end veteran homelessness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Woolley, a political science professor at University of California Santa Barbara, outlined three types of executive actions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Officially enumerated orders and proclamations;</li>\r\n\t<li>Presidential orders conveyed in writing in forms other than executive orders and proclamations;</li>\r\n\t<li>Discretionary actions by executive agencies that a president encourages or tolerates and could stop or reverse.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Woolley noted, though, that while the federal register catalogs executive orders, there is not a consolidated tally of all executive actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This makes comparing Obama&rsquo;s use of unilateral action to other presidents&rsquo; difficult, said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no single metric you can point to and say, &lsquo;This president has executed more unilateral actions than other presidents,&rsquo; &quot; Mayer said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, some scholars and politicians might disagree on what counts as unilateral presidential action and how important that particular action is, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But based on his research, Mayer said Obama has done nothing exceptional in terms of unilateral actions, compared to other presidents. Similar criticisms have been thrown at presidents from the opposing party for centuries, starting with George Washington&rsquo;s decision to proclaim neutrality in the war between England and France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unless agencies or scholars start to tally and examine all executive actions, not just orders, it may be impossible to quantify a president&rsquo;s use of unilateral power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People who say Obama has issued fewer (or certainly no more) executive orders than his immediate predecessors are correct,&quot; Woolley said. &quot;However, the claim that he has directed fewer executive branch discretionary actions is far less certain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s office provided us evidence about executive orders, not executive actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke said, &quot;This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People often point to the number of a president&rsquo;s executive orders to indicate his use of unilateral action, and by that metric, Obama has a lower record than most presidents in recent history. That&rsquo;s likely what O&rsquo;Rourke meant when he said &quot;executive action.&quot; But executive action includes much more than just orders, and there&rsquo;s no way to definitively calculate how many Obama has carried out in order to compare him to other presidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke is right when it comes to one type of executive action -- executive orders -- but the rest of the record is unclear.
