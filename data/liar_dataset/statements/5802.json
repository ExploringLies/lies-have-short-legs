Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, and Steve LaTourette, the Ohio Republican.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Unfortunately, we&#39;re again waiting for leadership from the Democrats who run Washington,&quot; Boehner added, and then refreshed a favorite GOP talking point: &quot;The Democrat-controlled Senate, it hasn&#39;t passed a budget in more than 1,000 days.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately the House approved the Ryan budget by a near party-line 228-191 vote, but it isn&rsquo;t expected to go anywhere in the Senate. PolitiFact Ohio, though, thought it&rsquo;d check out the speaker&rsquo;s claim about Senate budgets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt is similar to other statements that have been rated by PolitiFact national, PolitiFact Ohio, PolitiFact Wisconsin, PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact New Hampshire. Among them:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t&quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jun/16/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-chides-senate-democrats-not-passin/\">The Democrat-led Senate has failed to pass a budget for 750 days ...

(Ryan)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEach of those statements cites the same starting point as Boehner&rsquo;s claim of 1,000 days -- April 29, 2009. That was, &nbsp;according to the Congressional Research Service and news sources, when the Senate passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo budget resolution has passed since then, so Boehner&#39;s time tally -- like those of the previously checked statements -- is accurate. The day his video statement was posted, March 28, 2012, was 1,064 days from that date.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe PolitiFact rulings on these and other similar statements depended on their phrasing, but none was rated entirely True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKnowing how Congress comes up with its federal budget helps to explain why.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBudget resolutions are policy plans. They are not appropriations bills, or spending bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf a budget resolution doesn&rsquo;t pass, the federal government won&rsquo;t go dark. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, as a previous PolitiFact story said, &quot;the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority&#39;s organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if the Senate, under Democratic control, had neglected its basic responsibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur PolitiFact colleagues in Wisconsin, Florida and at PolitiFact national had the same question, and concluded that neither party can claim superiority on budget resolutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, the then Democratic-controlled House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution or adopt a single spending bill &quot;because the Democrats were afraid of being labeled big spenders,&quot; said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSenate Democrats didn&rsquo;t pass a fiscal 2011 budget because &quot;Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people&rsquo;s time with pointless political votes,&quot; a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told PolitiFact Florida. &quot;Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people&rsquo;s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur Florida colleagues also found that the House and Senate have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four earlier occasions since 1983.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. For fiscal 1999, 2005 and 2007, the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose facts lend perspective to Boehner&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut on its face, Boehner&rsquo;s statement is accurate. And it is more precisely worded than those that we&rsquo;ve previously checked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-25T16:00:02.357805", "ruling_date": "2012-04-26T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "John Boehner says Senate Dems haven't passed a budget in more than 1,000 days", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-boehner-says-senate-dems-havent-passed-budget", "ruling_link_text": "Truth-O-Meter rewards this claim for precision", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRep.
