It is likely that the Supreme Court will decide this matter for us, one way or another. Let&#39;s wait to see what the highest court of the land says about this issue which is so very important to many Rhode Islanders.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWe were interested in Tobin&rsquo;s assertion that any legislative action that is taken now by the General Assembly might become &quot;completely null and void&quot; after the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling on its two cases.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWe asked Tobin&rsquo;s office for an explanation. His spokesman said the bishop was out of town and unavailable.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tSo we started making inquiries.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThe<a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText13/SenateText13/S0038.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> first Rhode Island proposal</a> would, as a matter of law, replace the civil same-sex unions already legal in Rhode Island with same-sex marriage. That proposal has already passed the Rhode Island House.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText13/SenateText13/S0708.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">The second</a>, if approved by the General Assembly and signed by the governor, would call for a referendum on whether to enshrine same-sex marriage into the <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/RiConstitution/constfull.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Rhode Island Constitution</a>, a document that doesn&#39;t mention marriage at all.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tSupporters of same-sex marriage oppose this bill, in part, because it includes protections for businesses that would refuse, on religious grounds, to provide goods and services for same-sex ceremonies.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWe asked legal experts on both sides of the debate whether any action by the U.S. Supreme Court in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/mar/25/supreme-court-marriage-cases-primer/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">the two cases it is considering</a> could nullify action by the Rhode Island legislature. All said that passage of either Rhode Island bill would not be affected by a Supreme Court ruling.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThat&#39;s because neither bill is proposing to make same-sex marriage illegal. The Supreme Court, in contrast, is weighing the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriages, said <a href=\"http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=19\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Jesse Choper</a>, professor of public law at the University of California Berkeley School of Law.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tIn the case heard March 26, the issue was whether a successful voter initiative passed in California, known as Proposition 8, can lawfully ban same-sex marriages in that state.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tIn the case heard the next day, the issue was whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act, commonly called DOMA, is discriminatory because, like the California law, it &nbsp;restricts the definition of marriage to a union between one man and one woman. DOMA denies federal benefits to same-sex couples.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;There is absolutely no chance that the Supreme Court will nullify a Rhode Island law adopting same-sex marriage, either by referendum or by action of the General Assembly,&quot; said <a href=\"http://law.rwu.edu/jared-goldstein\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Jared Goldstein</a>, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;The issue in the two cases before the Supreme Court this term is whether laws against same-sex marriage violate the Constitution&#39;s guarantee of equal protection, not whether laws allowing same-sex marriage violate the Constitution,&quot; he said in an e-mail.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/faculty/FacultyProfiles/David%20Cohen/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">David S. Cohen</a>, a constitutional law and gender issues expert at Drexel University in Philadelphia, agreed: &quot;Rhode Island still has every reason to go forward if they want marriage equality,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tIf the Supreme Court were to broadly rule in the Proposition 8 case that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the right to marry -- a ruling most of our experts said seems unlikely given comments made by the justices during oral arguments -- that &quot;would legalize same-sex marriage in every state across the country no matter what the state is currently doing,&quot; Cohen said. A ruling on DOMA would only apply to federal law.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tEven if DOMA and the California proposition are upheld, &quot;It doesn&#39;t preclude [Rhode Island] from recognizing same-sex marriage either way,&quot; said <a href=\"http://law.rwu.edu/emily-j-sack\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Emily Sack</a>, also a professor at Roger Williams.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tIn theory, if the Supreme Court were to require every state to accept same-sex marriage, that would make the proposed referendum on the Rhode Island Constitution a meaningless ballot question.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;If the court rules that Prop 8 is invalid because same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry in every state, the ruling would effectively block a state referendum on the subject because we don&#39;t put constitutional rights to a vote,&quot; said Goldstein. But &quot;a decision granting same-sex marriage is under no threat of Supreme Court nullification, and the only realistic threat of nullification is if Rhode Island keeps the law as it is.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tBishop Thomas Tobin urged the General Assembly to delay consideration of any same-sex marriage legislation in Rhode Island because, &quot;Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tBut the question of whether to allow same-sex marriage -- the topic of the bills being considered by the state legislature -- is not what the U.S. Supreme Court is considering. The court is looking at the constitutionality of laws intent on blocking same-sex marriage.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThat&#39;s a key difference.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAs a result, except for an unexpected decision by the court to allow same-sex marriage nationwide, approval of either General Assembly bill is not going to be affected by what the justices decide in June.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWe rule Tobin&#39;s statement False.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
