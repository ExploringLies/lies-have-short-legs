The law makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and  requires law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status  of suspicious persons or risk being sued.<br /><br />In a recent television  interview with a South Florida CBS affiliate, Scott defended his  position that the legislation doesn't allow law enforcement officers to  stop immigrants based on skin color.<br /><br />\"No one believes in racial  profiling. I clearly don't believe in racial profiling,\" Scott said.<br /><br />\"But   the Arizona law permits it,\" interjected CBS4 reporter Gary Nelson<br /><br />\"Absolutely   not,\" Scott countered. \"It says you cannot do that. If you read the  Arizona law, what it says is if you are stopped for violating the law  and they have a suspicion that you're illegal, they can ask you if  you're legal. That's what it says.\"<br /><br />PolitiFact has already taken a  look at the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/04/jan-brewer/arizona-immigration-law-rewrite-lays-rest-worries-/\" target=\"_blank\">racial   profiling aspect of the law.</a> For this item, we'll analyze whether  Scott's summary of the law is accurate and complete.<br /><br />The key part  of the law reads, \"For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a  law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a  law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city,  town or other political subdivision of this state in the enforcement of  any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state where  reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is  unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be  made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the  person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an  investigation.\"<br /><br />We began by looking at whether the wording of the  law -- \"for any lawful stop, detention or arrest\" -- is equivalent to  Scott's formulation, \"stopped for violating the law.\"<br /><br />Not  exactly, say the legal experts we consulted, such as Michael M. Hethmon,  director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which helped write  the Arizona law.<br /><br />Arizona's law allows people to be questioned if  they are lawfully stopped or questioned for any reason, whether it's a  traffic stop, or a municipal violation like letting your grass grow too  tall in a community that requires frequent mowing. And suspects only  need be involved in a possible or potential violation, Hethmon said.<br /><br />Karl   Manheim, a law professor at Loyola Law School, agreed, saying that Scott's statement doesn't accurately convey the authority law  enforcement officers have under the law.<br /><br />\"If you are lawfully  stopped for any reason, they can demand immigration status,\" he said. He  said he doesn't consider Scott's formulation to be false, but rather  \"incomplete.\"<br /><br />There's a second discrepancy between the law and  Scott's explanation. Scott said law enforcement officials \"can ask you  if you're legal\" -- but the law uses the word, \"shall,\" which means it  isn't really an option, according to our experts.<br /><br />The law states  that a person can prove their immigration status by flashing valid  identification, such as an Arizona driver license or identification  card. It continues, \"Any person who is arrested shall have the person's  immigration status determined before the person is released.\"<br /><br />\"It  is not that 'they can ask,'\" said Jack Chin, a law professor at the  University of Arizona. \"It is that they 'shall' make an investigation if  practicable when there is reasonable suspicion. It is a requirement,  not an authorization.\"<br /><br />Scott is not alone -- many political  leaders have stumbled over the often-convoluted layers of the Arizona  immigration law. And with judicial challenges already underway, it's too  soon to say for sure how the law will be carried out in practice.  Ultimately, Scott's statement falls short on two counts -- on failing to  communicate the full range of violations that could trigger a police  stop, and on suggesting that the law gives wider discretion to officers  on when it should be enforced. So we find Scott's statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-17T13:06:53.146494", "ruling_date": "2010-06-17T13:36:53", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott says Arizona law allows police to ask about immigration status", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-immigration-arizona-status-illegal", "ruling_link_text": "He glosses over details", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rick Scott, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP0IAOJTUoU\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"interview on CBS 4\">interview with CBS 4</a>, June 3,  2010.<br /><br />CBS4, \"<a href=\"http://cbs4.com/local/rick.scott.gop.2.1730979.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rick Scott Fighting Checkered Past\">Rick Scott Fighting Checkered  Past</a>,\" June 3, 2010.<br /><br />Rick Scott, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ScottForFlorida?v=MqNnDvvv7Zg&amp;feature=pyv&amp;ad=5339901778&amp;kw=rick%20scott\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Arizona Immigration Law\">Arizona Immigration Law</a>,\"  May 23, 2010.<br /><br />Revised <a href=\"http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/HB_2162Signed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">text</a> of Arizona immigration law (HB 2162)<br /><br />Original  <a href=\"http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/SB_1070_Signed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">text</a> of Arizona immigration law (SB 1070) <br /><br />PolitiFact,  \"<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/04/kyrsten-sinema/under-arizona-immigration-law-overgrown-lawns-bark/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Under the Arizona immigration law, police are required  to check immigration status if someone's &quot;lawn is overgrown&quot;  or if a dog is &quot;barking too loudly\">Under the Arizona immigration  law, police are required to check immigration status if someone's \"lawn  is overgrown\" or if a dog is \"barking too loudly</a>,\" April 30, 2010. <br /><br />Christian  Science Monitor, \"<a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2010/0503/Arizona-immigration-law-revised-backtracking-or-fine-tuning\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Arizona immigration law revised: backtracking or  fine-tuning\">Arizona immigration law revised: backtracking or  fine-tuning</a>?\" May 3, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone interview,&nbsp; Michael M.
