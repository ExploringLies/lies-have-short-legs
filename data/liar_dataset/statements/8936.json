But he doesn&rsquo;t have the executive power to do the same for all workers, so the debate among the White House, Congress, economists and business leaders continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN <em>State of the Union</em> host Candy Crowley asked Steve Forbes, chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes Media, if raising the minimum wage would be good or bad for the bottom line, economically speaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Remember, in terms of minimum wage, they are often with businesses with small margins, and two-thirds of the people who start out in minimum wage are above the minimum wage within a year, when they get skills,&quot; said Forbes, a former Republican presidential candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll leave it to the economists to debate whether or not raising the minimum wage would help or hurt these workers. PunditFact wanted to know if two-thirds of minimum wage workers do start earning more within a year. Forbes didn&rsquo;t return our request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two papers that directly address his claim. In 2004, economists William Even and David Macpherson <a href=\"http://www.epionline.org/studies/macpherson_06-2004.pdf\"><u>published their findings</u></a> for the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative nonprofit think tank. Using federal labor statistics from the Current Population Survey, they did find that about two-thirds of workers see wage growth within a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, since that&rsquo;s pre-recession data, we&rsquo;ll place more emphasis on a <a href=\"http://econweb.tamu.edu/jmeer/Meer_West_Minimum_Wage.pdf\"><u>2013 report</u></a>. Two Texas A&amp;M University economics professors, Jonathan Meer and Jeremy West, updated Even and Macpherson&rsquo;s findings using the same data source from 1979 to 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meer and West reported the following trends of minimum wage workers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>16.55 percent leave the labor force</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>5.85 percent become unemployed</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those that remained in the workforce, Meer and West found that 65.85 percent receive higher wages the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s not that two-thirds of minimum wage workers earn more money the following year. It&rsquo;s two-thirds of those who continue to work, or 51 percent of all minimum wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimum wage earners may choose to leave the labor force because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, but with government benefits, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economics professor. There&rsquo;s a lot of flow in and out of the labor market that complicates Forbes&rsquo; claim, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sinclair also pointed out that there&rsquo;s selection at play in this statistic. Individuals who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving that they&rsquo;re dedicated employees who can hold down jobs. That might speak more to why they&rsquo;re getting a raise than anything else, Sinclair said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes said two-thirds of people working for the minimum wage earn more money within a year. The real figure is 51 percent, because some people leave the labor force or lose their job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes&rsquo; claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-16T10:20:20.919657", "ruling_date": "2014-02-16T13:41:12", "ruling_headline": "Steve Forbes says two-thirds of people who earn the minimum wage get a raise within 1 year", "ruling_headline_slug": "steve-forbes-says-two-thirds-people-who-earn-minim", "ruling_link_text": "Closer to half", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN <em>State of the Union</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://sotu.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/16/is-it-time-to-raise-the-minimum-wage/\"><u>Is it time to raise the minimum wage?</u></a>&quot; Feb. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jonathan Meer, Texas A&amp;M University economics professor, Feb. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employment Policies Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.epionline.org/studies/macpherson_06-2004.pdf\"><u>Wage growth among minimum wage workers</u></a>,&quot; June 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heritage Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/01/most-minimum-wage-jobs-lead-to-better-paying-opportunities\"><u>Most minimum-wage jobs lead to better-paying opportunities</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 21, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economics professor, Feb. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/12/us-usa-obama-wages-idUSBREA1B0PZ20140212\"><u>Obama signs order to raise minimum wage for federal contractors</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas A&amp;M University, &quot;<a href=\"http://econweb.tamu.edu/jmeer/Meer_West_Minimum_Wage.pdf\"><u>Effects of the minimum wage on employment dynamics</u></a>,&quot; December &nbsp;2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice of San Diego, &quot;<a href=\"http://voiceofsandiego.org/2014/02/10/fact-check-pay-hikes-for-minimum-wage-workers/\"><u>Fact check: Pay hikes for minimum wage earners</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 10, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Steve", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2644, "last_name": "Forbes", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "steve-forbes", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Steve-Forbes-37588-1-402.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2644/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Two-thirds of the people who start out in minimum wage are above the minimum wage within a year.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on CNN's \"State of the Union\"", "statement_date": "2014-02-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 29, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/29/", "subject": "Poverty", "subject_slug": "poverty", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
