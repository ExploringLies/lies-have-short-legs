Ted Budd is accusing his Democratic opponent Kathy Manning of benefiting from a development in Greensboro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budd represents North Carolina&rsquo;s 13th Congressional District, which covers much of the Greensboro-High Point area as well as the mostly rural area south of Winston-Salem and north of Charlotte. Manning is an attorney, and Budd has criticized her for donating more than $500,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mycmag.kantarmediana.com/KMIcmagvidbin2/HOUSE_NC13_BUDD_PARKING_DECK.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent Budd ad</a>, though vague on details, accuses Manning of profiting off a government project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A parking deck that nobody needed, benefiting a luxury hotel and Kathy Manning,&quot; a narrator says in the ad. &quot;$30 million of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year to Kathy Manning and her husband, filling the Manning&rsquo;s swanky hotel and their own French castle.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It concludes: &quot;From her castle, it&rsquo;s no surprise Queen Kathy doesn&rsquo;t care about doubling parking rates for workers and commuters because Kathy Manning makes government work for her and we pay the price.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manning called on Budd to remove the ad because, she says, it&rsquo;s nearly identical to a video&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=J4GSym54p4I\" target=\"_blank\">ad by the America First Action Super PAC</a>&nbsp;that was removed from a pair of Triad-area radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact contacted the Budd campaign about the claim. Budd&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Oglesby, cited several stories about the Westin Hotel being built in Greensboro by Elm Street LLC. Randall Kaplan, Manning&rsquo;s husband, is a part of the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those stories don&rsquo;t support the ad&rsquo;s claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the project</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaplan is described as a leader of Elm Street LLC, which is developing the Westin Hotel project. The city of Greensboro agreed to reimburse developers up to $30 million to build a parking deck adjoining the hotel, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greensboro.com/news/local_news/despite-accusations-and-threats-greensboro-council-votes-to-build-downtown/article_61e5ea80-a9be-59c9-a863-c827a00d8b4f.html\" target=\"_blank\">Greensboro News &amp; Record</a>&nbsp;reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deck is expected to be six stories tall and have 850 parking spaces, according to Jake Keys, communications manager for the city of Greensboro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $30 million isn&rsquo;t pure profit for developers. It&rsquo;s to pay developers to build the deck. That includes material, labor and other costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Under the reimbursement agreement, the developer will build a new public parking deck for the City in conjunction with the development of their hotel project. Once complete, the City will fully own and operate the new public parking deck,&quot; Keys said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An overestimation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city would own the deck and spend an estimated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greensboro-nc.gov/departments/transportation/gdot-divisions/business-parking/parking/general-information/parking-deck-development\" target=\"_blank\">$2.6 million a year</a>&nbsp;to maintain it and pay down the debt, according to the city&rsquo;s website. The operating cost will include general deck maintenance, cleaning it and keeping the lights on, Keys said. The city would raise yearly parking spot rental rates from $65 to $128 by 2025, according to another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greensboro.com/news/local_news/monthly-parking-fees-in-downtown-greensboro-could-almost-double-by/article_5ce52d1b-d60e-586f-a41d-7b1630a2659f.html\" target=\"_blank\">News &amp; Record story</a>&nbsp;provided by the Budd campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t go to Kaplan&rsquo;s group, either, Keys said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The City will maintain the deck, thus any amount (whether it is $2.3M or much less) will be completely an internal expense of the City paid for through revenues associated with the deck,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In the end, the hotel will pay for parking spaces in the City owned and operated deck just as any other business or individual.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever money Kaplan does receive from the project will be donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cfgg.org/blog/donor-story-randall-kaplan\">foundation announced</a>&nbsp;on Aug. 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The donations will be used to support a range of charitable programs, including economic and workforce development, health care, education, arts, poverty alleviation and social services in the Central Piedmont region of North Carolina and elsewhere,&quot; the foundation wrote on its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budd&rsquo;s ad said Kathy Manning got $30 million &quot;of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year&quot; from a luxury hotel and parking lot. While Manning&rsquo;s husband was involved in the project, Manning was not. And the $30 million represents the entire cost of the parking deck project &mdash; not gross profit for Manning or her husband. In fact, Kaplan is donating his profits. And the $2.3 million isn&rsquo;t going to Manning or her husband&rsquo;s group, either.
