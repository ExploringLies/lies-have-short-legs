Our head count showed pretty clearly that they didn&#39;t have the votes and he had to make the decision he did,&quot; he said. &quot;Similarly, the people of Rhode Island don&#39;t want same-sex marriage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNOM-RI has been quick to cite the polls it has commissioned as part of its campaign to press the governor and General Assembly to put the question of gay marriage to a statewide referendum. So we wondered whether any polls show that Rhode Islanders, in fact, don&#39;t want same-sex marriage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Plante to see if he had any updated numbers. He didn&#39;t. He said he was basing his assertion on the belief that a majority of residents had contacted their legislators to object to same-sex marriage, which is why Fox said there weren&#39;t enough votes in the House to pass a bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPeople who call their legislators don&#39;t necessarily reflect the opinion of the general public, just as legislators don&#39;t always vote with the majority of their constituents. (In this case, House spokesman Larry Berman told us that the calls coming in to Fox&#39;s office &quot;were fairly evenly divided between those in favor of same-sex marriage and those opposed.&quot; )<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven opinion polls aren&#39;t perfectly reflective because they usually only survey likely voters. But opinion polls are the best indicator we have, so we reviewed recent polls that addressed the issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNOM-RI itself has done surveys in Rhode Island. In its most recent, in December 2009, respondents were asked: &quot;As far as you are concerned personally, do you favor or oppose same-sex marriage in Rhode Island? And do you feel strongly about this?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA majority of those with an opinion actually endorsed same-sex marriage -- 42.6 percent said they strongly or somewhat favored it. &nbsp;Another 32.2 percent strongly or somewhat opposed it -- clearly not a majority, even among those who responded. Just under 23 percent were undecided and the rest had no opinion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was up from a poll the group conducted <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/2009/pdf/profughi_same_sex_marriage_poll.pdf\">six months earlier</a>, when support for gay marriage was 36 percent and opposition was pegged at 43 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(In an example of how you can get a different answer if you word the question differently, NOM-RI turned the question on its head in both surveys by asking respondents whether they supported or opposed this statement: &quot;Only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in Rhode Island.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(In the December 2009 survey, 44.9 percent expressed support for the statement [and, by implication, opposition to gay marriage], 43.6 percent felt the other way, and 9.7 were undecided. But even that question showed a significant increase in support for gay marriage compared to the poll six months earlier, when 52 percent agreed with the anti-gay-marriage statement and 38 percent expressed opposition to it.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSupporters of gay marriage have done their own polling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a July 2010 <a href=\"http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/news/ri-marriage-survey-instrument-2010.pdf\">poll commissioned by Rhode Island Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (RI-GLAD)</a>, 59 percent of 502 likely voters said they strongly or somewhat favored &quot;allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally.&quot; Thirty-one percent were somewhat or strongly opposed. In a <a href=\"http://www.greenbergresearch.com/articles/2506/5918_Rhode%20Island%20Marriage%20Equality-Analysis.pdf\">2008 RI_GLAD poll</a>, 49 percent favored same-sex marriage; in 2006, 45 percent approved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, when we looked closer at the 2010 RI-GLAD survey, we found that it initially primed respondents by telling them in an earlier question that, &quot;Churches, clergy and other religious institutions would NOT be required to perform same-sex marriages.&quot; That reassurance might have bumped up the approval rating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe only independent Rhode Island poll we found was <a href=\"http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2009/05/survey\">released by Brown University</a> in May 2009, before the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls. Its survey of 593 registered voters found that 60 percent of registered Rhode Islanders expressed support when asked, &quot;Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married?&quot; Thirty one percent said they would oppose it. About half of the opposition was hard core - 17 percent said they would even oppose civil unions for gay couples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe mentioned those results to Plante.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Would I repeat that I believe the majority of Rhode Islanders don&#39;t want gay marriage? Yeah, I&#39;ll repeat that,&quot; he said when we spoke with him. &quot;Can I give you a definitive poll that shows that? No.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he also said that his claim is justified because House Speaker Fox couldn&#39;t get enough votes for gay marriage in his own chamber. That, he asserted, is because people were &quot;calling their representatives and saying &#39;We don&#39;t want this.&#39; . . . I wasn&#39;t making a statistical claim.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe disagree. Of course it&rsquo;s a statistical claim. When you say &quot;the people of Rhode Island don&#39;t want same-sex marriage&quot; you&#39;re saying that more than 50 percent would oppose such legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent polls from Brown, RI-GLAD and even NOM-RI -- Plante&rsquo;s organization -- show the opposite.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot only did the trends in the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls show opposition to same-sex marriage evaporating, the Brown and RI-GLAD polls showed that the public wants gay couples to have the right to marry, even if you assume that every voter who didn&#39;t express an opinion was opposed to gay marriage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlante&#39;s assertion isn&#39;t just false. It&#39;s ridiculous.
