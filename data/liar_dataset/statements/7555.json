Not so fast.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Not your money</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloggers had noticed a March 19 &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=214d83bf95c4de5cbc11f33aa2f667e9&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">request for information</a>&quot; from an Air Force contracting office &quot;seeking sources for providing the Air Force installations a Fantasy Football Program.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Air Force&rsquo;s original request for information included some clues that taxpayers might not be involved.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt mentioned the personnel center services division, and the Air Force&rsquo;s &quot;nonappropriated&quot; purchasing office.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe personnel center <a href=\"http://www.afpc.af.mil/services/index.asp\">services division </a>runs recreation and leisure programs for Air Force members and their families around the world, including clubs, bowling, golf, fitness, arts and crafts, and recreational shooting. It also manages the Air Force&rsquo;s &quot;nonappropriated funds&quot; &mdash; money that comes from fees and other cash collected from airmen and their families who take part.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat is to say: Money that doesn&rsquo;t come from Congress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s not taxpayer money, and it&rsquo;s not subject to budget cuts under the sequester.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s not a small amount of money, with <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2007-05-22/us/military.gambling_1_slot-machines-military-personnel-gaming-machines?_s=PM:US\">tens of </a><a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2007-05-22/us/military.gambling_1_slot-machines-military-personnel-gaming-machines?_s=PM:US\">millions</a> of dollars from overseas on-base <a href=\"http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/afman34-229/afman34-229.pdf\">slot machines</a> alone.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt even supports a <a href=\"https://www.nafjobs.org/about.aspx\">different type of federal employee</a>, not considered federal civil servants because they&rsquo;re not funded through normal congressional appropriations. Those employees run the activities and programs that also include things like restaurants, youth centers, and auto and wood shops.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe goal of all these programs, sometimes called &quot;MWR&quot; for morale, welfare and recreation, is just what it sounds like: to boost troop morale.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd, for 17 years, they&rsquo;ve included an annual program called the &quot;Football Frenzy,&quot; said Air Force spokesperson Laurel Tingley. In 2011, for example, airmen who joined the Air Force Services Clubs could <a href=\"http://www.afclubs.net/IMG/FrenzyBanner_Fnl.2011.jpg\">win a trip to the Super Bowl</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis year, the personnel center services division wanted to find out what it would take to add fantasy football to the Frenzy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThus, <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=214d83bf95c4de5cbc11f33aa2f667e9&amp;_cview=0\">the request</a> for &quot;information and pricing on providing product branding, hosting, managing, and delivering all programs and materials related to running a Fantasy Football League,&quot; that would serve airmen, civilians and family members at &quot;over 100 installations worldwide.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;What we&#39;re looking at doing is enhancing a program that airmen have enjoyed for 17 years,&quot; Tingley said. &quot;And the entire program is funded through (nonappropriated funds).&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTingley didn&rsquo;t have details about exactly what the Air Force sought to create, but a fantasy football league wouldn&rsquo;t have been unplowed ground in the world of military morale &mdash; the Navy organized a <a href=\"http://www.jointbasemdl.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123218576\">fantasy football contest</a> with commercial sponsors in 2010 that offered a grand prize of $100,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn March 21, 2013, the Air Force <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=95a0ad6a2d8868a90953e533bd18d650&amp;_cview=0\">updated its request</a> to say:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>&quot;This RFI is issued by the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO). All requirements, solicitations and subsequent contracts, if any, awarded through AFNAFPO are funded wholly with Nonappropriated funds.

Meanwhile, any money at stake wouldn&rsquo;t have come from taxpayers, but &quot;nonappropriated funds&quot; generated by Air Force clubs and other activities designed to boost morale.
