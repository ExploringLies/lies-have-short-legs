Police are still investigating the altercation, which left Sir Christopher Meyer bloodied but in stable condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some bloggers have connected the attack with President Donald Trump&rsquo;s visit the next day and the protests that went alongside it. On July 13, protesters gathered in the city, guiding a large, baby Trump balloon past Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Meanwhile, Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May at a military demonstration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier that week, Meyer was beaten in the Victoria London Underground Station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An article, posted on clickbait site <a href=\"http://www.neonnettle.com/news/4514-british-politician-beaten-by-protestors-for-welcoming-trump-to-the-uk-\">Neon Nettle</a>, claimed that Meyer was &quot;savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he &lsquo;welcomed&rsquo; the U.S. president to the United Kingdom.&quot; This seemed out of line with other reports of the event, which did not mention political motives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to investigate whether Trump&rsquo;s visit was tied directly to Meyer&rsquo;s attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The editorial</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days before the protests, the Independent published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-uk-visit-nato-london-us-ambassador-national-security-a8440536.html\">an editorial</a>&nbsp;written by Meyer. That same day, he was attacked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the piece, Meyer cautioned protesters against angering Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our security and prosperity depend in large measure on keeping our close and long-standing partnership in good working order,&quot; he writes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meyer argued that in spite of Trump pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement on climate change,&nbsp;engaging with the president and maintaining close ties between the countries is imperative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neon Nettle hypothesized that this show of support was enough to rile up &quot;a gang of anti-Trump protestors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The attack</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Meyer&rsquo;s wife told The Times that she suspected the attack was politically motivated: &quot;He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, London police said <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/former-british-ambassador-sir-christopher-meyer-brutally-attacked-at-victoria-station-a3885386.html\">it is more likely that Meyer&rsquo;s assailants wanted to rob him</a>. There has been no evidence released thus far to tie the attack to the protests or to suggest that Meyer was targeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Neon Nettle article says that Meyer was attacked by &quot;a mob of thugs&quot; involved with the protests against Trump. However, only two suspects were arrested: a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy. They were released from custody while the investigation into their involvement continues, according to a press release by the British Transport Police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the attack took place on Wednesday, July 11, two full days before the official protests and <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-uk-visit-itinerary-date-times-and-full-schedule-plus-everything-you-need-to-know-a3886636.html\">a day before Trump arrived in the country</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Neon Nettle also alleges that &quot;violent riots&quot; have occurred throughout London in response to Trump&rsquo;s visit. While there were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/uk/trump-visit-london-protests-intl/index.html\">massive protests</a> against Trump in the capital, there were few news reports of violence. In a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/13/in-london-pro-trump-counter-protesters-hit-with-abuse-some-violence.html\">single altercation outside of a pub</a>, one man was arrested for hitting a Trump supporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been no evidence released linking the attack of a former ambassador&nbsp;to Trump&rsquo;s visit to the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meyer was beaten by two teenagers, not a &quot;gang of anti-Trump protestors,&quot; as Neon Nettle alleges. The protests against Trump, which took place two days after the attack, were relatively uneventful as far as violence goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because police are still investigating the incident, we cannot conclusively say that it was not motivated by politics. However, for that same reason,&nbsp;Neon Nettle goes too far to say that it was. Further, it&nbsp;is an overstatement to say that the anti-Trump protests were &quot;violent riots.&quot; Our ruling is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-17T14:03:06.857844", "ruling_date": "2018-07-17T15:22:45", "ruling_headline": "No evidence of political motives in ambassador attack", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-evidence-political-motives-ambassador-attack", "ruling_link_text": "Police still investigating", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Neon Nettle, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.neonnettle.com/news/4514-british-politician-beaten-by-protestors-for-welcoming-trump-to-the-uk-\">British politician beaten by protestors for &#39;welcoming Trump to the&nbsp;UK</a>,&quot; July 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Independent,&nbsp;</em>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-uk-visit-nato-london-us-ambassador-national-security-a8440536.html\">As the former ambassador to the US, believe me when I say we should care what Trump thinks on his visit to London</a>,&quot; July 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evening Standard, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/former-british-ambassador-sir-christopher-meyer-brutally-attacked-at-victoria-station-a3885386.html\">Sir Christopher Meyer attack: Former British ambassador </a><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/former-british-ambassador-sir-christopher-meyer-brutally-attacked-at-victoria-station-a3885386.html\">brutally beaten</a><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/former-british-ambassador-sir-christopher-meyer-brutally-attacked-at-victoria-station-a3885386.html\"> by thugs at Victoria Station</a>,&quot; July 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evening Standard, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/donald-trump-uk-visit-itinerary-date-times-and-full-schedule-plus-everything-you-need-to-know-a3886636.html\">Donald Trump UK visit itinerary</a>,&quot; July 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/uk/trump-visit-london-protests-intl/index.html\">London protests send </a><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/uk/trump-visit-london-protests-intl/index.html\">clear</a><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/uk/trump-visit-london-protests-intl/index.html\"> message to Trump: You&#39;re not welcome</a>,&quot; July 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/13/in-london-pro-trump-counter-protesters-hit-with-abuse-some-violence.html\">In London, pro-Trump counter-protesters hit with abuse, some violence</a>,&quot; July 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press Release from the British Transport Police, July 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;An elderly British politician has been savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he &lsquo;welcomed&rsquo; the U.S. president to the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-07-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
