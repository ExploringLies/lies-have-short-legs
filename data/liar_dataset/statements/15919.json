Kavanaugh denies the allegations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kavanaugh accuser&rsquo;s husband breaks his silence, exposes &lsquo;sick issue&rsquo; his wife has,&quot; said the headline on a <a href=\"http://virginiapress31.site/kavanaugh-accusers-husband-breaks-his-silence-exposes-sick-issue-his-wife-has/\">Sept. 25 story</a> posted on a website operating under the banner &quot;Virginia Press.&quot; Its URL is virginiapress31.site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;According to Russell Ford, his wife Christine has long had issues with not getting &lsquo;the attention or respect she felt she deserved.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s certainly getting a lot of attention now, which calls into question the validity of her claims that Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her during a drunken high school party 36-years-ago. Were Christine Ford&rsquo;s unbelievable accusations rooted in her incessant need for attention all along?&quot; said the Virginia Press story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story accurately quotes Russell Ford&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/christine-blasey-ford-wanted-to-flee-the-us-to-avoid-brett-kavanaugh-now-she-may-testify-against-him/2018/09/22/db942340-bdb1-11e8-8792-78719177250f_story.html?utm_term=.bb87659bfd3d\">comments to the Washington Post</a> about his wife not getting the attention or respect she felt she deserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Virginia Press site misrepresents what he said to paint it in a negative light. Russell Ford did not make those comments in efforts to expose a &quot;sick issue.&quot; That&rsquo;s a conclusion the website makes. Russell Ford&rsquo;s comments in the Washington Post story are in the context of how they met and built a relationship. Christine Blasey Ford grew up on the east coast and now lives in California, where she is a professor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She didn&rsquo;t always get along with her parents because of differing political views,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/christine-blasey-ford-wanted-to-flee-the-us-to-avoid-brett-kavanaugh-now-she-may-testify-against-him/2018/09/22/db942340-bdb1-11e8-8792-78719177250f_story.html?utm_term=.8702d9335549\">Russell Ford told the Washington Post</a>. &quot;It was a very male-dominated environment. Everyone was interested in what&rsquo;s going on with the men, and the women are sidelined, and she didn&rsquo;t get the attention or respect she felt she deserved. That&rsquo;s why she was in California, to get away from the D.C. scene.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also claims that Christine Blasey Ford has been berated by online student reviews. Bloggers made those claims based on reviews for another professor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Virginia Press website features several elements associated with websites promoting false information. There&rsquo;s no indication who&rsquo;s behind the website, where it&rsquo;s based or who are its authors.
