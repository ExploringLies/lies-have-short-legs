Rick Perry from his seat, took a swing at the agency during the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&#39;ve got to look at transparency, efficiency and accountability in all areas of state government,&quot; she said. &quot;We have seen sloth, if you will, sloppy management in the Texas Youth Commission, in criminal justice, in the Texas Department of Transportation, where they misplaced a billion dollars.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA billion dollars, MIA?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChris Lippincott, TxDOT director of media relations, said: &quot;That&#39;s not correct.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn October 2007, TxDOT officials accidentally counted $1.1 billion in bonds revenue twice, he said &mdash; a mistake that led the agency to commit an extra billion to road projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChief Financial Officer James Bass realized the agency had erred by a billion dollars when it approved $4.2 billion for construction in fiscal 2008. Because of the mistake, the department announced huge cuts in spending that froze some road projects that were ready to go.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There was an accounting error,&quot; Lippincott said. &quot;A miscalculation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tActually, there were two accounting errors, according to an August 2008 state audit of the agency. In adding up what was available for projects, department forecasters added $581 million of bond money that was already in a $3.1 billion total. Then, they lumped in another $488 million from the Texas Mobility Fund, money that was actually already tabbed to pay for past projects. Taken together, that was $1.069 billion that at least some people in the agency counted twice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTxDOT didn&#39;t announce its gaffe until a February 2008 legislative hearing, where lawmakers were skeptical that it was just a number-crunching error and not a tactical move to create a financial crisis and thus pressure legislators to ease the limits on private toll road contracts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe audit concluded that &quot;ineffective communication, a complex reporting structure, and misunderstanding of reported data led the Department of Transportation to overschedule $1.1 billion in planned contract awards for fiscal year 2008.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo one has shown that any money was misplaced, as Medina claimed. The money never existed in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut she didn&#39;t miss the point. The transportation behemoth did make a billion-dollar mistake, a misstep that hobbled crucial road projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Medina&#39;s claim Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-22T16:40:26.711527", "ruling_date": "2010-01-22T06:38:47", "ruling_headline": "Medina says TxDOT lost $1 billion ", "ruling_headline_slug": "medina-said-txdot-lost-1-billion", "ruling_link_text": "Double-counted funds crippled road projects", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tState Auditor Office, <a href=\"http://www.sao.state.tx.us/reports/main/08-045.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">An audit report on the Department of Transportation&#39;s Financial Forecasting and Fund Allocation,</a> August 2008</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.texasdebates.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Debates,</a> Jan. 14</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Chris Lippincott, Texas Department of Transportation director of media relations, Jan. 22</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAustin American-Statesman, State road officials say they were erred by $1 billion, by Ben Wear, Feb. 6, 2008</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAustin American-Statesman, Audit explains TxDOT error, by Ben Wear, Aug. 29, 2008</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Businesswoman", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Debra", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 303, "last_name": "Medina", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "debra-medina", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/MedinaPolimug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/303/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;The Texas Department of Transportation... misplaced a billion dollars.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "statement_context": "a debate.", "statement_date": "2010-01-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
