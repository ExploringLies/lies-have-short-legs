Rand Paul took exception to claims that budget cuts have hurt the National Institute of Health&rsquo;s efforts to find a cure for Ebola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kentucky Republican was the headliner at an Oct. 15 rally in Ashland for Dave Brat, the GOP nominee for the 7th District congressional seat. Paul, a Tea Party favorite, said NIH has money to waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you know what the NIH spends money on?&quot; he asked the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul listed a series of NIH projects he viewed as profligate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on &lsquo;origami&rsquo; condoms,&quot; &nbsp;he said. &quot;This is a family crowd, so I&rsquo;m not getting into what that means.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we will. We wondered if his claim is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper to form animals, flowers and other designs, according to Webster&rsquo;s New World College Dictionary. We struggled to imagine how this centuries-old craft might improve the condom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul&rsquo;s office backed the senator&rsquo;s statement by sending us several articles about NIH&rsquo;s funding of condom research, the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/issues/taxpayers-paid-2-4-million-to-develop-origami-condoms/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>earliest one</u></a> published by the Washington Free Beacon this March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out, there&rsquo;s a California company, named <a href=\"http://www.origamicondoms.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>ORIGAMI</u></a>, that&rsquo;s vowing to reinvent the condom, a contraceptive that many men don&rsquo;t like. The company believes the popularity of condoms &nbsp;-- which must be unrolled and are typically made of latex -- would greatly improve if they were more pleasing, less cumbersome and safer to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ORIGAMI is developing condom with accordion-like pleats. They&rsquo;re made of silicone and, because they&rsquo;re loose-fitting and don&rsquo;t have to be unrolled, can be put on faster than traditional condoms. The company is seeking FDA approval and hopes sell its product next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of global health organizations are encouraging condom research and development, convinced that greater use of devices will lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2006, NIH has awarded <a href=\"http://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter_searchresults.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>seven grants</u></a> totaling almost $2.5 million to help develop male and female ORIGAMI condoms. The money was provided to Strata Various, a product design firm headed by Danny Resnic, ORIGAMI&rsquo;s founder. Resnic is listed on the grant documents as the project leader of the research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ORIGAMI&rsquo;s work has been praised by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which last year handed out <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/253231/meet-the-11-condoms-of-the-future-selected-by-bill-gates\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$1.1 million in grants</u></a> other entrepreneurs seeking to improve condoms. The Foundation <a href=\"http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2013/03/Reinventing-The-Condom\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> ORIGAMI &quot;provides an excellent example of a private enterprise focused on new condom design to promote consistent use by emphasizing the sexual experience.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s return to Paul&rsquo;s speech. The senator, in lamenting the use of public funds to develop &nbsp;&quot;origami&rsquo; condoms,&quot; never defined the difference between the folded paper art and the name of a company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, whether his boss was referring to Origami with a capital &quot;O,&quot; meaning the company, or a small &quot;o,&quot; meaning the art form. &quot;The senator&rsquo;s words speak for themselves,&quot; Darling replied in an email. &quot;I don&rsquo;t understand the confusion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day before he appeared in Ashland, Paul spelled origami with a small &quot;o&quot; in Facebook post and a tweet assailing NIH&rsquo;s spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;NIH blames tightening federal budget for its inability to produce <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ebola\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">#Ebola</a>vaccine, but somehow found $2.4 million to develop &#39;origami&#39; condoms designed with Japanese folding paper in mind,&quot; Paul wrote on his Facebook page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He tweeted, &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NIH\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">@NIH</a> cant afford<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hash\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> #Ebola</a> vaccine bc of &#39;budget cuts&#39; but can spend $2.4 mill to develop &#39;origami&#39; condoms<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Priorities?src=hash\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> #Priorities</a><a href=\"http://t.co/UblqXl2Amp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does the company have to say about all this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Bardwell, an ORIGAMI spokesman, defended the grants, saying they are given out &quot;based on scientific merit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Condoms are considered a medical device. As such, it must pass FDA safety testing standards through clinical trials that are very expensive,&quot; Bardwell said. &quot;An innovation condom could take 3-4 years and several million dollars for R&amp;D and human testing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In trying to document waste at NIH, Paul said the health agency spent $2.4 million on &quot;origami&quot;&nbsp;condoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul didn&rsquo;t provide any more information in his speech, leaving the crowd to wonder whether tax dollars are going to the development of paper condoms folded into fancy shapes. What he didn&rsquo;t say is that ORIGAMI is the name of a company that has received the NIH grants to develop an improved condom that is made of silicone and has fold-out pleats. NIH has long encouraged &nbsp;condom use to reduce unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t find much fault with Paul, however. The company, by its very name, suggests the principles of origami drive its design. So we rate Paul&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-24T17:48:13.753068", "ruling_date": "2014-10-27T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rand Paul says NIH spent $2.4 million on 'origami' condoms", "ruling_headline_slug": "rand-paul-says-nih-spent-24-million-origami-condom", "ruling_link_text": "But not your traditional origami", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rand Paul&rsquo;s comments at Ashland, Va. rally, Oct. 15, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails from Brian Darling, spokesman for Sen.
