People who play scratchers and video poker are, in a roundabout way, sending some of their cash to schools and parks and other ventures even as they hope to win the big one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what piece of the overall Lottery revenues does that represent? Well, according to the Lottery website, billboards, TV spots and print ads, it&rsquo;s about 97 cents on the dollar.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what the Lottery said in a recent print ad that appeared in the June 17, 2012 Oregonian:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Every time a dollar is played on a Lottery game, think about ninety-seven cents of that dollar helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all. Ninety-seven cents represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds. Ninety-seven cents really adds up.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;d seen this same messaging several times before (some variation of the 97-cent ad has been in circulation since October 2010). And so had at least one of our readers who wrote in asking us to take a look at this claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called the Oregon Lottery&rsquo;s spokesman, Chuck Baumann, to see where they got the figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe pointed us to a lengthy report on the Lottery&rsquo;s home page that <a href=\"http://oregonlottery.org/About/docs/2011cafr.pdf\">details the operation&rsquo;s finances</a> for fiscal year 2011. The pertinent table, he said, was on Page 24 and showed that the Lottery had net sales of some $9.8 billion in 2011. Of that cash, about $300 million -- or 3 percent -- went to administrative expenses, which left 97 percent for the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe thing is, not all of that leftover 97 percent is going to community development. The same chart shows just $523 million going to the economic development fund -- the pot of money that helps schools and parks and other areas of the state. But, as most any math student can tell you, $523 million is not 97 percent of $9.8 billion -- it&rsquo;s a bit more than 5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe majority of it -- more than $9 billion -- went to &quot;prizes to the public.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter looking through the report, we found another breakdown of expenses that seemed to tell a different story altogether. This one, on Page 14, showed the Lottery&rsquo;s total operating revenue at just over $1 billion. Of that money, $514 million went to operating expenses -- prizes, salaries and wages, game vendor charges, market research, public information, etc.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother $550 million went to the economic development fund -- about 52 percent of the the total operating revenues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Baumann what the difference was between the two tables.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe one he showed us, which has nearly $10 billion in revenues, counts something called &quot;churn,&quot; he said. See, the state&rsquo;s biggest source of income (as far as gambling goes) comes in the form of video Lottery. Let&rsquo;s say you sit down to play and put $20 into the machine. You play the full $20 dollars and you wind up with $10 in winning credits and you play them and lose. Well, that all gets added up in the chart as $30 of revenues -- even though that subsequent $10 never existed as real cash into the system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConversely, the operating revenues chart that we looked at only represents the initial $20 that you played -- the actual cash into the system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the end though, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter which way you look at it, the Lottery&rsquo;s ads are clearly misleading. The way the ads read, you&rsquo;d think 97 cents of each dollar goes to &quot;helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, the Lottery does note that $500 million dollars is returned &quot;to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds.&quot; But, however you slice it, that $500 million is not 97 cents of each dollar played.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you look at the big total, which includes the churn, that $500 million is about 5 percent of the Lottery revenues. With the smaller operating revenues budget, it&rsquo;s a bit over 50 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the Lottery were really returning 97 percent of every dollar played to those programs, the state&rsquo;s budget problems would be smaller by at least a billion dollars a biennium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Lottery argues that the prize money going back to players ultimately benefits the state&rsquo;s economy -- that&rsquo;s why some earlier ads simply said &quot;97 cents of every dollar played comes back to Oregon.&quot; But even those ads mislead by highlighting state services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd what&rsquo;s more, winnings don&rsquo;t necessarily stay here. If you win $1 million in the Oregon Lottery, would you spend it all in Oregon?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaumann defended the earlier version but acknowledged that you could &quot;certainly misconstrue&quot; the meaning of the ad we&rsquo;re ruling on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think it&rsquo;s more than a matter of misconstruing meaning. For nearly two years, the Oregon Lottery has been running a disingenuous ad campaign that tries to paint playing the Lottery as giving back to schools, parks and other economic development projects. Yes, a piece of the revenue goes there -- but not 97 cents of every dollar played. &nbsp;We think a state agency that deals with money in billions -- and spends nearly $13 million a year on advertising, market research and public information &nbsp;-- should know better.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/06/does_97_cents_of_every_lottery.html\">Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-20T20:04:21.130828", "ruling_date": "2012-06-20T17:03:17", "ruling_headline": "Do 97 cents of every Lottery dollar played go back to the state?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-97-cents-every-lottery-dollar-played-go-back-", "ruling_link_text": "No matter how you dice it, the statement misleads", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tOregon Lottery, &quot;<a href=\"http://oregonlottery.org/About/docs/2011cafr.pdf\">Comprehensive annual financial report</a>,&quot; Nov. 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Oregon Lottery spokesman Chuck Baumann, June 19 and 20, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 1769, "last_name": "Oregon Lottery", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "oregon-lottery", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Oregon_Lottery_logo.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1769/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays 97 cents of every dollar played &quot;represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an advertisement", "statement_date": "2012-06-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 291, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/291/", "subject": "Lottery", "subject_slug": "lottery", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/14/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
