They always like to say &#39;oh that&#39;s a conspiracy theory.&#39; Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people, and it&#39;s very hard because the state guards their records. They don&rsquo;t want to see it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is there evidence that millions and millions of people have voted many times? No, there&#39;s not. But we will summarize the research on this topic. National experts have said that voter fraud is isolated and rare -- and the same holds true for voting multiple times, a phenomenon called double voting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Double voting -- a person casting more than one ballot in an election -- is not the same thing as a person being registered in more than one state, which often happens when people move. Pew found in 2012 that approximately <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/pewupgradingvoterregistrationpdf.pdf\">2.75 million people</a> have registrations in more than one state. But as we&rsquo;ll see, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that 2.75 million people actually voted more than once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Trump&rsquo;s spokesman to ask for evidence and didn&rsquo;t get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Research on double voting</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of experts in computer science and political science from Stanford and University of Pennsylvania published a<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bbzgpeo1rh1s7dy/OnePersonOneVote.pdf?dl=0\"> paper </a>in 2017 that estimated the prevalence of double voting in the 130 million ballots cast in the 2012 presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers estimated that 33,000 votes, or .02 percent of the votes cast, could have been double votes, but they called that an upper-bound estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We would expect to estimate there were around 33,000 double voters even if there were no actual double votes cast,&quot; they wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper concluded that there was almost no chance that double votes could affect the outcome of a national election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers explained in an essay in <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/11/we_looked_at_130_million_ballots_from_the_2012_election_and_found_zero_fraud.html\">Slate</a> that double voting is hard to detect because voting records cannot be easily linked across state lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state of Kansas, who helped lead <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/05/donald-trump/trump-blames-democratic-states-providing-voter-d/\">Trump&rsquo;s now defunct voter fraud commission</a>, promotes the <a href=\"http://www.nased.org/NASED_Winter_2013_PP_Presentations/KANSAS.pdf\">Interstate Crosscheck Program</a>, an ongoing program that coordinates the collection of registration records across states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 2014, 28 participating states provided the program with their registration records. The states received a list of registrations in their own state that matched the first name, last name, and date of birth recorded on a registration in another member state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2012 election, Crosscheck flagged more than 1.4 million registrations as potential duplicates that member states should further scrutinize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the key word there is <em>potential.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In a country where 130 million votes are cast in a presidential election, there is a surprisingly high chance that two ballots cast under the same first name, last name, and date of birth actually belong to two different people,&quot; the researchers wrote. &quot;While it is unlikely that any two randomly selected vote records would share a common first name, last name, and birthdate, a sizable number of these cases will occur once we aggregate over the 10 quadrillion pairs of vote records in the population. This phenomenon is what statisticians call the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem\">birthday paradox</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Investigations of double voting</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been some investigations into double voting, some of which led to prosecutions, but they are rare -- far, far less than millions of votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conservative <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/voter-fraud-database-tops-1000-proven-cases\">Heritage Foundation</a> keeps a <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud\">voter fraud database</a> which said it showed 1,071 proven instances of fraud including 961 criminal convictions between the 1980s and 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the database, we counted 80 criminal conviction cases for duplicate voting between 2001 and 2017. (In a few cases, two individuals were convicted.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The California Secretary of State was investigating 56 allegations of double voting as of March 2017, according to its response to a public records request by <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/articles/valid-voter-fraud-complaints-in-california-dozens-not-millions/\">CALmatters</a>, a nonprofit journalism venture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety said in the fall of 2017 that <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-nh-speaker-jasper-report.pdf\">196</a> people were being investigated as possibly having voted in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/15/kris-kobach/there-evidence-voter-fraud-new-hampshire-kris-koba/\">New Hampshire </a>and one other state. This information is still under view, and the state expects to announce findings in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News 21, a national investigative reporting project, found that there had been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/01/voter-fraud-is-not-a-persistent-problem/?utm_term=.0a0a255f063f\">13 cases in Arizona prosecuted for double voting</a>, according to a 2016 report.
