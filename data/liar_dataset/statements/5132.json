With a little reporting, we found that four Georgia residents are challenging Obama&rsquo;s eligibility for the state presidential preference primary and general election ballots.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey&rsquo;re saying Obama isn&rsquo;t a natural-born citizen, which would mean that under the Constitution, he&rsquo;s not eligible to be president. Critics of this line of thought call some of these people &quot;birthers,&quot; a term these challengers by and large reject.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Farrar of Cedartown in west Georgia thinks Obama&rsquo;s biggest problem is that there needs to be proof in addition to the president&rsquo;s birth certificate confirming he was born in the U.S.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKevin Powell of Duluth, Carl Swensson of Morrow and David Welden of Powder Springs think that Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen. Powell and Swensson say they can cite U.S. Supreme Court precedent to prove it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA fifth challenger rescinded his complaint, said Kim Beal, a staff attorney with the Office of State Administrative Hearings, which is handling the challenges. A hearing is set for Jan. 26.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Man up,&quot; Swensson&rsquo;s challenge told Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp&lsquo;s office administers the state&rsquo;s elections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia has addressed such arguments before, and they didn&rsquo;t do well on the Truth-O-Meter. The claims about Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate range from <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/apr/27/birthers-obama-certificate-live-birth/\">False to Pants on Fire</a>. PolitiFact Georgia also found problems with an argument that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/mar/09/loren-collins/birther-foe-says-ga-bill-gets-constitution-wrong/\">Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut these theories aren&rsquo;t the focus of this inquiry. We&rsquo;re trying to figure out whether Democrats are right that Republicans are trying to knock Obama off the ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObviously, these concerned citizens all want him gone. But are they Republicans? And is this a GOP-sanctioned effort? &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked into the challengers&rsquo; Republican bona fides.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey emphasized that the Republican Party is not coordinating their efforts. Swensson told &nbsp;PolitiFact Georgia that he reached out to the party for its support and got none.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Basically, what I get from them is crickets,&quot; Swensson said. &quot;Lots and lots of crickets.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Republican Party Chairwoman Sue Everhart distanced the state party from the challenges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Georgia Republican Party is not a party to any of those challenges, and had no knowledge of them before they were filed,&quot; Everhart said in a statement released by a party spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe challengers all said their efforts have nothing to do with their party affiliations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s an entirely nonpartisan effort. It has nothing to do with politics, only to do with the Constitution,&quot; said Welden, who said he has voted Republican but leans independent. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, challenges do have significant GOP ties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Rep. Mark Hatfield, a Republican attorney from Waycross, represents Powell and Swensson in their challenge. He is vice chairman of the state House&rsquo;s Judiciary Non-Civil Committee and is listed as the Republicans&rsquo; deputy majority whip.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast year, Hatfield sponsored legislation that would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state&rsquo;s ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSwensson is chairman of the Clayton County Republican Party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTennessee lawyer Van Irion represents Welden. He ran for Congress in 2010 and won the backing of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. Irion lost in the Republican primary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrly Taitz, a California lawyer, represents Farrar. She ran unsuccessfully in 2010 to be the Republican nominee for California secretary of state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFarrar told PolitiFact Georgia he considers himself a Republican. Voter records show Powell voted in six Georgia primaries between 1996 and 2008 and chose a Republican ballot in all of them. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow do we rule?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are efforts to &quot;remove Barack Obama from Georgia&rsquo;s Presidential Ballot in 2012,&quot; as Democrats said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether &quot;Republicans&quot; are trying to do this is a dicier issue. The Georgia Democrats&rsquo; language could lead a reasonable person to think that the effort is organized by the GOP.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s not. Nevertheless, these challenges are dyed bright red. A GOP state representative does represent two of the challengers, and two unsuccessful Republican candidates from Tennessee and California represent the rest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne challenger is chairman of his county GOP. Three of the four challengers consider themselves Republicans, and all of them have voted Republican.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause the state party is not involved in the challenge, but individual Republicans are leading the charge, we rate the Georgia Democrats&rsquo; statement Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-13T12:33:33.304814", "ruling_date": "2012-01-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Georgia Democrats say Republicans trying to knock Obama off ballot", "ruling_headline_slug": "georgia-democrats-say-republicans-trying-knock-oba", "ruling_link_text": "Not the party, just the party faithful", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGeorgia Democrats website, &quot;<a href=\"http:// www.georgiademocrat.org/2011/12/21/republicans-attempt-to-remove-president-obama-from-georgia-ballot/\">Republicans Attempt to Remove President Obama from Georgia Ballot</a>,&quot; Dec. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOffice of State Administrative Hearings, Challenges to Candidate Qualifications, filed Nov. 21, 2011, through Dec. 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/obamas-inclusion-on-georgia-1262319.html\">Obama&#39;s inclusion on Georgia ballot challenged</a>,&quot; Dec. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRockdale Citizen, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rockdalecitizen.com/news/2011/dec/18/5-challenge-obamas-inclusion-on-ga-ballot/\">5 challenge Obama&#39;s inclusion on Ga. ballot</a>,&quot; Dec. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution voter database, accessed Jan. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLos Angeles Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/13/local/la-me-taxday14-2010apr14\">Activist who challenges Obama&#39;s citizenship is booted from Tax Day Tea Party</a>,&quot; April 13, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia General Assembly 2011,<a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display.aspx?Legislation=33230\"> House Bill 401</a>, accessed March 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChattanooga Times Free Press, &quot;Irion promotes strict views on market, U.S. Constitution,&quot; Aug. 6, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Eric Gray, communications director, Democratic Party of Georgia, Jan. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Vincent Russo, general counsel, Office of Secretary of State Brian P.
