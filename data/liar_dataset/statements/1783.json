Greece is not too big to fail -- it has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. It&#39;s too connected.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wondered whether the Dallas-Fort Worth&#39;s gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced -- could really be larger than that of an entire European nation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the World Bank, Greece&#39;s gross domestic product in 2008 was $355 billion, ranking it 26th in the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, statistics calculated for the same year by the U.S. government&#39;s Bureau of Economic Analysis determined that the metro area consisting of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, Texas, had a gross domestic product of $379 billion -- close enough in our view to make Will&#39;s statement correct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDallas-Fort Worth-Arlington actually ranked sixth among highest-GDP metro areas in the United States. Will could have just as easily pointed to five other metro areas that have bigger GDPs than Greece -- the ones based (in ascending order) in Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. New York City&#39;s economy, in fact, was about three and a half times the size of Greece&#39;s in 2008.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust to be sure, we also compared statistics for GDP adjusted by &quot;purchasing power parity&quot; -- a tweak that eliminates distortions based on the relative value of currencies and the local costs of commodities. The adjusted GDP for Greece is $330 billion, which is smaller than Greece&#39;s unadjusted GDP, but only by a modest amount. (The adjusted GDP uses the U.S. as its yardstick for comparison, so its GDP number does not change.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll in all, we rate Will&#39;s comment True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-11T16:55:00.785914", "ruling_date": "2010-05-12T11:00:52", "ruling_headline": "Will says Greece's economy is same size as Dallas-Fort Worth's", "ruling_headline_slug": "will-says-greeces-economy-same-size-dallas-fort-wo", "ruling_link_text": "Correct--and five other U.S. metro areas are bigger", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>George Will, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-holder-giuliani/story?id=10596448&amp;page=4\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> during a roundtable discussion on ABC&#39;s This Week, May 9, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorld Bank, &quot;Gross domestic product 2008&quot; (<a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">table</a>), accessed May 11, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorld Bank, &quot;Gross domestic product 2008, PPP&quot; (<a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP_PPP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">table</a>), accessed May 11, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBureau of Economic Analysis, &quot;News Release: GDP by Metropolitan Area, Accelerated 2008, New 2007, and Revised 2005-2006&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/2009/xls/gdp_metro0909.xls\" target=\"_blank\">table attachment</a>), Sept. 24, 2009</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "Columnist", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "George", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Maryland", "id": 155, "last_name": "Will", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "george-will", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 18, "party": "Columnist", "party_slug": "columnist", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/18/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gwill.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/155/", "total_count": 34, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/03/24/LI2005032402294.html"}, "statement": "<p>Greece &quot;has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a roundtable segment on ABC's This Week", "statement_date": "2010-05-09", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
