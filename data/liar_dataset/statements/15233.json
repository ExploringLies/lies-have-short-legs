Robert Pittenger faces a challenge from Rev. Mark Harris, who lost the 2016 primary against Pittenger by only 134 votes. The duo has traded barbs over Pittenger&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/15/mark-harris/robert-pittenger-among-most-liberal-republican-con/\">voting record</a>, whether Harris&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/16/robert-pittenger/pittenger-misleads-about-his-opponents-support-tru/\">worked to stop Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;from becoming president and now&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/05/mark-harris/did-nc-republican-oppose-funding-border-wall/\">over the omnibus bill</a>&nbsp;that Congress passed and Trump signed in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris thinks Pittenger should&rsquo;ve opposed the bill since it&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-claims-border-wall-under-cons/\">didn&rsquo;t fully fund a border wall</a>, among other reasons. Pittenger, meanwhile, has touted its benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the bill&rsquo;s positives, Pittenger said in a recent newsletter, is that the bill &quot;does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked about the newsletter, Pittenger&rsquo;s staff pointed to a breakdown of the omnibus bill that was circulated by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican Conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her summary of the bill, emailed to House Republicans, says &quot;there has never been a line item for Planned Parenthood in the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pittenger campaign also pointed out a congratulatory letter he received from the National Right to Life organization &ndash; which the campaign included in its statement about Planned Parenthood funding.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nrlc.org/site/\">National Right to Life</a>&nbsp;is an anti-abortion group that has endorsed Pittenger and gives him a 100 percent &quot;pro-life&quot; voting record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Funding remains</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s letter supports Pittenger&rsquo;s claim that the bill doesn&rsquo;t include any &quot;line item&quot; money specifically for Planned Parenthood. But, the NRL letter notes that Planned Parenthood affiliates &quot;are able to tap into funds from the various long-standing health programs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The greatest amount of federal money to Planned Parenthood flows through so-called &lsquo;mandatory spending programs,&rsquo; mostly Medicaid,&quot; the letter says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, recent estimates show that the organization about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-planned-parenthood-survive-without-federal-funds/\">40 percent of its funding</a>&nbsp;from the government. Planned Parenthood receives more than&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/may/09/barry-loudermilk/would-gop-bill-expand-womens-health-care-curbing-p/\">$500 million</a>&nbsp;in combined state and federal government funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a Medicaid patient comes to Planned Parenthood, the organization can bill the organization for services the patient chooses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another portion can come through the government&rsquo;s Title X Family program, which subsidizes birth control and tests for sexually-transmitted diseases. But Congress and President Donald Trump last year passed a law that allows states to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/us/politics/planned-parenthood-trump.html\">withhold that funding</a>&nbsp;for groups like Planned Parenthood. Pittenger&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIXcsYnR-TU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\">voted for that law</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawrence Shaheen, a spokesman for the Pittenger campaign, argued that the newsletter isn&rsquo;t deceptive because it included the National Right to Life letter explaining that Planned Parenthood still receives funding through other means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some tried to cut all funds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the omnibus bill&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/breaking-whats-in-the-massive-omnibus-spending-deal\">doesn&rsquo;t end funding</a>&nbsp;for Planned Parenthood, even if the health organization isn&rsquo;t specifically mentioned as a funding recipient. But it wasn&rsquo;t for a lack of trying by some Republicans in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some House Republicans &ndash; including several from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/19/congress-spending-bill-government-shutdown-471884?lo=ap_c1\">House Freedom Caucus</a>&nbsp;&ndash; tied their support for the spending bill to cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/07/planned-parenthood-defunding-government-spending-package-392513\">Politico</a>. However, the effort died largely because the bill wouldn&rsquo;t garner enough support in the Senate to pass, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/8/17095904/planned-parenthood-defund-congress-spending-bill\">Vox.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood&#39;s continued eligibility for federal funding prompted Senate Minority Leader&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/trump-obama-omnibus-spending-budget/556436/\">Chuck Schumer to tout the bill</a>&nbsp;as a victory for Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&rsquo;t have the House. We don&rsquo;t have the Senate. We don&rsquo;t have the presidency,&quot; Schumer said, &quot;but we produced a darn good bill for the priorities that we have believed in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the omnibus bill gives no new funding to Planned Parenthood and doesn&rsquo;t designate money for the organization by name, it does allow Planned Parenthood to continue receiving money from the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pittenger said the spending bill &quot;does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood.&quot; Technically, in the very literal sense of the word &quot;designate,&quot; Pittenger is right. The bill doesn&rsquo;t specifically direct funding to Planned Parenthood by name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the federal government continues to pay for Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s services through Medicaid and other programs. And since voters are more likely to care about whether their tax dollars go to an organization &ndash; not whether the organization is specifically named in legislation &ndash; we rate Pittenger&#39;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-06T13:03:21.435661", "ruling_date": "2018-04-06T13:00:52", "ruling_headline": "Pittenger says bill doesn't designate money for Planned Parenthood", "ruling_headline_slug": "pittenger-says-bill-doesnt-designate-money-planned", "ruling_link_text": "They still get Medicaid reimbursements", "ruling_state": "North Carolina", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>A newsletter distributed by Rep.
