Rob Andrews.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce those visas expire, the individuals go from being welcomed visitors to outlaws, vanishing into the population, the Democratic congressman said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAndrews, who represents parts of southern New Jersey, made that point during an interview posted online on Sept. 12 with Townsquare Media New Jersey. Andrews is seeking re-election this November against Republican challenger Gregory Horton.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The number-one source of undocumented people in this country is not people coming across the Mexican border,&quot; Andrews said. &quot;It is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPinning an exact number on a hidden population remains challenging, but most available estimates suggest Andrews is overstating how many illegal immigrants first arrived legally and stayed past the valid time limits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat &quot;overstay&quot; population typically represents about one-third to roughly half of the country&rsquo;s illegal immigrants. Therefore, about half to roughly two-thirds of illegal immigrants are generally those who entered the country illegally.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in April that people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent of illegal immigrants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That may be a high number, because what we have found is a lot of people who were marked as visa overstays had, in fact, left,&quot; according to a transcript of Napolitano&rsquo;s remarks at a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDefending Andrews&rsquo; statement, his chief of staff, Fran Tagmire, argued there are more visa overstayers than people who illegally crossed the Mexican border. But we told Tagmire that Andrews&rsquo; statement did not directly compare those two groups, but instead claimed overstayers are the &quot;number-one source&quot; of all illegal immigrants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s review the estimates we found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA common measure for estimating the overstay population has been analyzing data from the immigration forms visa holders must file when they enter and leave the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on that methodology, in January 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that out of the 7 million illegal immigrants in January 2000, 33 percent were individuals who stayed after their temporary visas had expired.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a May 2004 report, the U.S. General Accounting Office argued overstayers also include certain groups who had entered the country legally without visas and did not fill out those immigration forms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing three alternative data sources, the GAO report estimated the overstay population at 31 percent, 27 percent and 57 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent estimate we found was released in May 2006 by the Pew Hispanic Center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe center estimated that out of between 11.5 million and 12 million illegal immigrants in 2006, &quot;between 33% and 50% are visa overstayers.&quot; That estimate is based in part on the immigration form data used in the January 2003 analysis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, data on overstayers has been considered unreliable, in part because of the incomplete collection of those immigration forms when foreign visitors leave the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe majority of illegal immigrants appears to be due to illegal border crossings, but it&rsquo;s difficult to reach a precise number, said Edward Alden, an expert in immigration policy for the Council on Foreign Relations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview with Townsquare Media New Jersey, Andrews claimed the &quot;number-one source&quot; of illegal immigration &quot;is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tData on the overstay population has been labeled unreliable, but most available estimates suggest such individuals are not the &quot;number-one source.&quot; Those estimates indicate most illegal immigrants had entered the country illegally.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost studies have said overstayers range from about one-third to roughly half of all illegal immigrants, and the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary said people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/politifact_nj_rep_rob_andrews.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-20T18:58:23.143773", "ruling_date": "2012-09-23T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
