Scott Walker claimed Jan. 22, 2014 in his State of the State speech is of particular interest to students attending college in the University of Wisconsin System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After years of 5.5 percent average tuition increases,&quot; Walker said, &quot;we now have a two-year tuition freeze for the first time in the history of the UW System.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is likely a statement Walker will repeat as the campaign for the November 2014 gubernatorial election picks up steam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing that tuition rates vary among the different UW System institutions -- four-year universities vs two-year colleges, for example -- we wondered if the increases have averaged 5.5 percent and if there has never before been a two-year tuition freeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The system</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wisconsin.edu/about/\">UW System</a> is made up of 13 four-year universities, 13 freshman-sophomore colleges and the statewide UW-Extension. Altogether, the system serves some 181,000 students each year and employs more than 39,000 faculty and staff, with an annual budget of $6 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system was <a href=\"http://www.uwsa.edu/cert/publicat/factbook.pdf\">created in 1974</a> by a law that merged the state&rsquo;s two public university systems under an 18-member <a href=\"http://www.wisconsin.edu/bor/\">Board of Regents</a>. That board -- 16 members are appointed by the governor and two are state school officials -- sets tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Informational-Papers/Documents/2013/34_UW%20tuition.pdf\">Generally speaking</a>, the regents request that 65 percent of instructional funding come from state general fund money and the remaining 35 percent from tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Freezing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we dive into the numbers, it&rsquo;s important to note there are four tuition rates within the UW System: one for UW-Madison; one for UW-Milwaukee; one for the other four-year schools, such as Superior, Eau Claire and La Crosse; and one for the two-year colleges, such as UW-Fox Valley and UW-Waukesha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two-year tuition freeze Walker highlighted in his speech has gotten plenty of <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/plan-to-expand-voucher-schools-in-racine-county-suddenly-dropped-b9937499z1-212146211.html\">news coverage</a>. It was included in his 2013-&rsquo;15 state budget, which became law in June 2013. The governor had <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-proposes-uw-tuition-freeze-much-smaller-funding-increase-ns9v8bm-207619231.html\">proposed the freeze</a> the previous month amid anger over how the UW System cash reserves had grown in recent years even as tuition kept increasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.uwsa.edu/budplan/tuition/tuitionHistory.pdf\">table listing tuition rates</a> that was posted by the UW System in January 2014 shows that once before, in 2000-&rsquo;01, there was an across-the-board freeze for all four tuition rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have never been back-to-back, across-the-board tuition freezes until the current one, which covers 2013-&rsquo;14 and 2014-&rsquo;15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for the<a href=\"http://uwc.edu/about\"> two-year colleges</a>, tuition was locked for four straight years, from 2007-&rsquo;08 through 2010-&rsquo;11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.5 percent</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the 5.5 percent part of Walker&rsquo;s claim, here&#39;s a look at each of the four rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UW-Madison:</strong> Tuition rose 7.9 percent to $9,273 in 2012-&rsquo;13, the table shows. Over the previous five years, tuition increases ranged between 5.5 percent to 9.73 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That includes a base tuition increase of 5.5 percent each year, plus an additional &quot;differential&quot; approved by the regents and UW-Madison students, UW System spokesman David Giroux told us. Money from differentials, which are also done by other UW campuses, gets targeted to needs such as high-demand classes that need more instructors, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UW-Milwaukee:</strong> Tuition rose 5.5 percent to $8,091 in 2012-&rsquo;13. The increases were also 5.5 percent in each of the previous five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other four-year schools:</strong> The rates of increase were the same as at UW-Milwaukee. Tuition for 2012-&rsquo;13 was $6,298.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two-year colleges:</strong> After the four-year freeze, tuition rose 5.5 percent in each of the next two years, and was $4,750 in 2012-&rsquo;13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said: &quot;After years of 5.5 percent average tuition increases, we now have a two-year tuition freeze for the first time in the history of the UW System.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuition increases were 5.5 percent or more for at least the two years before the current two-year freeze, depending on whether you&rsquo;re considering tuition at the four-year universities or the two-year colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current freeze is the first two-year freeze system-wide, but not the first for the system&rsquo;s two-year colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Walker&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-23T12:07:13.522764", "ruling_date": "2014-01-23T13:48:10", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin college tuition: Average increases 5.5%, never before been frozen two straight years?", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-college-tuition-average-increases-55-nev", "ruling_link_text": "2-year schools enjoyed a 4-year freeze", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>University of Wisconsin System, <a href=\"http://www.uwsa.edu/budplan/tuition/tuitionHistory.pdf\"><u>&quot;UW System Resident Undergraduate Tuition 1967-68 Through 2013-14,&quot;</u></a> Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Gov.
