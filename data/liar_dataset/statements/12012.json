Each state gets to decide how poor a household must be in order to qualify.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Missouri covers children newborn to age 1 at 196 percent of the poverty level, meaning babies qualify as long as their families make just less than $40,000 dollars a year. For children 1 to 18 years old, Missouri covers them at 150 percent of the poverty level, or a yearly family income of about $30,000 dollars, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-state/missouri.html\" target=\"_blank\">Medicaid.gov</a>. However, their parents are only covered if they make less than about 18 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or about $3,600 dollars per year.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The Missouri Department of Social Services&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dss.mo.gov/fsd/pdf/mhk_mhf_ta_income_guidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">charts income guidelines for parents to qualify for Medicaid</a>; it shows the maximum income to qualify for a family of three is $301 dollars per month, or $3,612 dollars per year. We reached out to Koster&rsquo;s campaign, but did not get a response as to where he got the number he tweeted&nbsp;($3,504).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Carolyn Orbann, associate professor of health sciences at MU, said it&rsquo;s important to note that because Missouri has not expanded Medicaid, childless adults are not covered regardless of their poverty level. That&rsquo;s not the case in 32 other states. &quot;The states that have expanded Medicaid qualify adults without children who make 138 percent of the poverty level &mdash; in some states, even those who make more than that,&quot; Orbann said.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In other words, a woman without children in Illinois or Arkansas could make around $16,000 dollars per year and be covered by Medicaid, but a woman in Missouri with two children making above $3,600 would not.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Even among states that have not expanded Medicaid,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kff.org/medicaid/fact-sheet/where-are-states-today-medicaid-and-chip/\" target=\"_blank\">only Texas and Alabama had lower maximum income caps</a>&nbsp;for parents on Medicaid than Missouri, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan information source on health issues. Kansas, which also has not expanded Medicaid, covers parents at 38 percent of the poverty level &mdash; more than double Missouri&rsquo;s 18 percent of the poverty level standard.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Koster may be off by a little more than $100 when it comes to the maximum income a single mother of two can have and still qualify for Medicaid.
