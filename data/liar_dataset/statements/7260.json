Chris Christie made some ambitious financial predictions in 2012, generating both praise and controversy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPerhaps the boldest claim? New Jersey&rsquo;s revenues would rise 8.4 percent for the current fiscal year that began July 1, a forecast criticized by Wall Street analysts and New Jersey Democrats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Christie has held firm on his forecast and discussed what he said is the state&rsquo;s improving economic news during his Jan. 8 State of the State address in Trenton.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration&rsquo;s projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy,&quot; Christie said, citing other accomplishments such as job growth and increases in both consumer spending and industrial production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLooking strictly at numbers, the governor&rsquo;s claim is accurate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNew Jersey operates on a fiscal year that starts July 1 and ends June 30. Since Christie&rsquo;s comment references the current fiscal year and the months before Hurricane Sandy, which hit the state on Oct. 29, 2012, we&rsquo;re looking at gross income tax revenue for July through October, and comparing it with the same months in 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the current fiscal year, there was no growth in income tax revenue through August, with receipts falling nearly 1 percent to $780 million from $786 million the year before, according to a monthly report produced by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services to track growth and decline in state revenue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThings changed in September, when fiscal year-to-date income tax receipts climbed to $1.8 billion from $1.7 billion the year before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Income tax collections remain strong as the State&rsquo;s economy continues to grow,&quot; state Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said in a September news release about the revenue growth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFiscal year-to-date revenue through October jumped 9.8 percent to $2.69 billion from $2.45 billion for the same period a year ago, thanks to an extra payday that month and delayed tax payments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s why October&rsquo;s revenue jump was so high.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmployers in New Jersey pay withholding taxes to the state every Wednesday, generating between $100 million to $150 million, said David Rosen, chief budget officer for the OLS. October happened to have five Wednesdays, meaning an extra $100 million or so in revenue for the state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother accounting shift resulted in a $60 million increase because of Tropical Storm Irene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Irene hit in late August 2011, taxpayers were given until Oct. 30 to make their quarterly tax payment normally due in September. That payment was to generate $60 million for the state. As a result of the deadline extension, the money didn&rsquo;t show up in the state accounting system until November. So, the October ledger was minus $60 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe October 2012 ledger, however, shows $60 million because the usual Sept. 15 tax payment deadline applied this year and the money ended up in state coffers on time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Combined, these two effects artificially boost the current cash flow by about $160 million compared to last year&rsquo;s baseline,&quot; the October 2012 OLS revenue report states.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo technically, there was growth in income tax receipts -- with some help from bookkeeping measures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The statement is literally true,&quot; Rosen said of Christie&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreasury data showed similar growth in gross income tax receipts, but other revenue accounts aren&rsquo;t doing as well, according to numbers from both the Treasury and OLS. Overall, New Jersey faces a shortfall of $425.9 million for the first six months of the fiscal year. Adding in money left over from last year, the total shortall is $549 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChristie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not respond to a request for comment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring his State of the State address last week, Christie said, &quot;Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration&rsquo;s projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLooking at the current fiscal year, year-to-date gross income tax revenue increased year-over-year in September and October -- even though October&rsquo;s significant growth resulted primarily because of an extra payday that month and an accounting measure.
