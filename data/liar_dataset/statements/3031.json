Ted Strickland had used a theme song in his unsuccessful re-election bid, it might have been &quot;I&#39;ve Been Working on the Railroad.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJobs were the biggest issue of the fall campaign, and Strickland said that thousands would be created by his plan for a &quot;3C Corridor&quot; passenger rail system linking Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. He described Gov.-elect John Kasich&rsquo;s intention to kill the plan and return a $400 million federal grant as tragic and a job-killer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCritics of the plan claimed that its employment potential was exaggerated, its ridership forecasts were too optimistic and its cost projections too low.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, Plain Dealer columnist and former editorial director Brent Larkin wrote: &quot;Voters never warmed to the idea of spending hundreds of millions on a passenger rail project that would have taken riders from Cleveland to Cincinnati over a period an hour and 15 minutes longer than it would have taken on a New York Central train in 1935.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t usually look at remarks from columnists, but that comment stopped PolitiFact Ohio in its tracks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe knew that the 3C Corridor was not a high-speed rail plan. We had not realized it was more like a trip back in time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo PolitiFact Ohio asked Larkin where he got his figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe referred us first to a year-old feasibility report on the proposed Cleveland-to-Columbus-to- Cincinnati Amtrak service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is the schedule Amtrak said it would run, and the schedule Ohio included as part of its application to the feds for the $400 million,&quot; Larkin said. &quot;No other schedule was ever formally provided to the feds.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe proposed schedule shows a 255-mile Cleveland to Cincinnati trip taking 6-1/2 hours. The first daily train would leave Cleveland at 6:30 a.m. and arrive in Cincinnati at 1 p.m.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLarkin then shared a railroad timetable from New York Central Lines, effective Feb 3, 1935. It showed a departure time of 3:10 p.m. from Cincinnati and an arrival in Cleveland of 8:20 p.m., for a travel time of 5 hours 10 minutes -- an hour and 20 minutes faster than the 3C line.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCriticism of the 3C as &quot;snail rail&quot; with an average speed of 39 mph started as soon as the project was proposed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Ohio Department of Transportation responded in September with a new average estimate of 50 mph and &quot;speed up to 79.&quot; It shortened the Cleveland-to-Cincinnati trip to 5 hours 12 minutes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, not so fast.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs an October story in the Columbus Dispatch noted, ODOT itself had said a year earlier that the trip couldn&#39;t be made in less than 5 hours 20 minutes -- even if the trains didn&#39;t stop. ODOT&rsquo;s revised schedule hadn&#39;t even been seen by the three freight lines that own the tracks the 3C passenger trains would use, putting its feasibility in serious doubt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd, no matter how weak or strong its support, the optimistic revision still comes up longer than the best rail time of 1935.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The schedules speak for themselves,&quot; Larkin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-06T18:12:09.604939", "ruling_date": "2011-01-07T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Columnist Brent Larkin's claim about 1935 steam train stoked with truth", "ruling_headline_slug": "columnist-brent-larkins-claim-about-1935-steam-tra", "ruling_link_text": "Truth all aboard for this train story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, Brent Larkin, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2011/01/a_train_that_ohioans_were_luck.html\">A train that Ohioans were lucky to miss</a>,&quot; Jan. 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmtrak, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/Rail/Programs/passenger/3CisME/AmtracReport/FINAL_3C_QUICKSTART_AMTRAK_STUDY_FULL_REPORT_12_18_09.pdf\">Feasibility Report on Proposed Amtrak Service, Cleveland-Columbus-Cincinnati</a>,&quot; Dec. 18, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Central Lines timetable, Form 1001, effective Feb. 3, 1935<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, &quot;&#39;<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/04/snail_rail_criticism_dogs_supp.html\">Snail rail&#39; criticism dogs supporters of Ohio&#39;s 3C passenger rail plan</a>,&quot; April 3, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Department of Transportation, <a href=\"http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/Rail/Programs/passenger/3CisME/Pages/3CTrainRunTimeAnalysisandTrainPerformanceCalculations.aspx\">3C &quot;Quick Start&quot; Train Run Time Analysis and Train Performance Calculations</a>, September 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Columbus Dispatch, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/10/24/railroads-werent-in-on-new-3c-rail-study.html\">Railroads weren&#39;t in on new 3C rail study</a>,&quot; Oct. 24, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Columnist, retired director of The Plain Dealer's editorial page", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Brent", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 947, "last_name": "Larkin", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "brent-larkin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-brent-larkin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/947/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://connect.cleveland.com/user/brlarkin/index.html"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays the 3C Corridor train would have taken&nbsp; &quot;an hour and 15 minutes longer&quot; to carry passengers across Ohio &quot;than it would have taken on a New York Central train in 1935.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a newspaper column", "statement_date": "2011-01-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 150, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/150/", "subject": "Stimulus", "subject_slug": "stimulus", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
