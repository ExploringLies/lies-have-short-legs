The image used at the top of the story is taken from <a href=\"https://www.nbcuniarchives.com/compilations/healthandwellness/ambulances\">NBC footage</a> recorded after a shooting at the Capitol <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/28/politics/u-s-capitol-and-white-house-on-lockdown/index.html\">on March 28, 2016</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But FreedomCrossroads.us had a familiar feel to it &mdash; it shared a design template with TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That site was run by a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/may/31/If-youre-fooled-by-fake-news-this-man-probably-wro/\">man named Christopher Blair</a>, who has told us he was a self-described liberal troll living in Maine.

Its posts are archived back to <a href=\"http://freedomcrossroads.us/page/11/\">March 21, 2017</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tried to reach Blair to verify he was the site&rsquo;s owner but didn&rsquo;t get any response.
