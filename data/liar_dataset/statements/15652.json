New York City&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/temporary_housing_report.pdf\">Homeless Services Department&rsquo;s May survey</a> had 62,147 individuals staying in temporary housing. That stat overstates the number of apartments needed, because it includes children in families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless in New York City says the actual number of homeless households, both families and single adults, is <a href=\"http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/the-catastrophe-of-homelessness/facts-about-homelessness/\">closer to 32,000</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning to vacancies, the city&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdf/about/2017-hvs-initial-findings.pdf#page=17\">2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey</a> did find 247,977 &quot;vacant units, not available for sale or rent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before we dive into that big number, the survey found another 79,000 vacant apartments that were actually on the rental market. That&rsquo;s the number Giselle Routhier, the homeless coalition&rsquo;s policy director, focuses on. Routhier compared it to the number of apartments needed, not the number of homeless people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are about 2.5 vacant rental apartments for every homeless household in New York City,&quot; Routhier said. &quot;But the problem is even worse than the point-in-time data. New York City loses thousands of affordable apartment every year through rent increases and deregulation. Between 1996 and 2017, New York City lost more than 1.1 million housing units with contract rents below $800 per month.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Routhier&rsquo;s way of looking at the city&rsquo;s costly housing market is very different from Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s, but the final numbers are reasonably close. Routhier said about 2.5 and Ocasio-Cortez said about three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matthew Gordon Lasner, associate professor of urban studies at Hunter College, warned that the focus on math only takes you so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The comparison she&rsquo;s making &mdash; no matter the ratio or numbers &mdash; is really a rhetorical device, to point out that the city has the capacity to house all its residents,&quot; Lasner said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">When a vacancy isn&rsquo;t a vacancy</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So now let&rsquo;s get back to that big number of nearly 248,000 &quot;vacant units, not available for sale or rent.&quot; It&rsquo;s not what it might seem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total includes 58,000 units &quot;undergoing renovation&quot; and another 22,000 rented or sold &quot;but not yet occupied.&quot; All told, about 129,000 units are vacant due to one process or another that takes them out of the active housing market.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Total rental units</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,183,064</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Occupied</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2,103,874</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Vacant, available</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>79,190</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Vacant units, not available for sale or rent</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>247,977</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>74,945</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Rented, not yet occupied</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>10,960</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Sold, not yet occupied</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>11,156</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Undergoing renovation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>58,347</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Awaiting renovation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>20,283</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>In legal dispute</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>9,626</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Held pending sale of building</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>5,886</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Owner&rsquo;s personal problems (age, illness, etc.)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>12,719</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Held for other reasons</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>27,009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>But that still leaves nearly 75,000 units in the category of &quot;held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use.&quot; These are the pied-&agrave;-terre of the well-to-do, and sometimes, the super-duper-well-to-do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A bit of that is new &ndash; &nbsp;global billionaires parking money in Midtown condos,&quot; said Lasner. &quot;But New York&rsquo;s always had tens of thousands of suburbanites, U.S. out-of-towners, and foreigners keeping apartments.
