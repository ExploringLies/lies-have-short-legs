So did we.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>South Carolina&rsquo;s concern</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Forced home inspections&quot;? Um, no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flurry originated with <a href=\"http://benswann.com/obamacare-provision-forced-home-inspections/\"><u>BenSwann.com</u></a> blogger Joshua Cook on Aug. 13. He picked up the phrase &quot;forced home inspections&quot; from a state lawmaker in South Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in March, as a group of state legislators discussed a bill to fight the Affordable Care Act, Rep. Rick Quinn <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsTUKf87OSw#at=21\"><u>offered a specific example</u></a> of something in the law that worried him: &quot;The forced home inspections that I&rsquo;ve heard about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cook was there. And the comment nagged him. He noticed people weren&rsquo;t really writing about the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s just been bothering me,&quot; he told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So he wrote about it last week, talking with an attorney who spoke at the committee hearing and posting <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsTUKf87OSw#at=21\"><u>a video clip</u></a> of Quinn&rsquo;s comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The point is South Carolina legislators believe it, and are convinced this is going to happen,&quot; Cook told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quinn, indeed, had added <a href=\"http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess120_2013-2014/bills/3101.htm\"><u>an amendment</u></a> to the South Carolina Freedom of Health Care Protection Act to prevent state workers from conducting any &quot;involuntary &hellip; in-home visitation.&quot; It passed the House, but the Senate didn&rsquo;t have a chance to vote. Cook says lawmakers hope to revive the legislation in the next session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that Obamacare program that worries Quinn? It already is &mdash; by statute &mdash; voluntary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s literally nothing to suggest raids or weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Home visiting programs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerned bloggers pointed to an Obamacare-funded <a href=\"https://grants3.hrsa.gov/2010/Web2External/Interface/FundingCycle/ExternalView.aspx?&amp;fCycleID=9E7EA909-4562-4FBE-86DA-D5F383C3ACFB&amp;ViewMode=EU&amp;GoBack=&amp;PrintMode=&amp;OnlineAvailabilityFlag=True&amp;pageNumber=1\"><u>grant program</u></a> for &quot;maternal, infant and early childhood home visiting.&quot;<strong> </strong>In 2011, the government announced <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/09/20110922b.html\"><u>$224 million</u></a> in funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of those grants are going to <a href=\"http://ersrs.hrsa.gov/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/HGDW_Reports/FindGrants/GRANT_FIND&amp;ACTIVITY=D89&amp;rs:Format=HTML4.0\"><u>health departments</u></a> &mdash; none, so far, in South Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pewstates.org/projects/home-visiting-campaign-328065\"><u>The idea</u></a>: fund visits from nurses and social workers to high-risk families to help them develop skills to keep kids healthy, get them ready for school, and prevent child abuse and neglect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home-visit programs <a href=\"http://nccp.org/publications/pub_862.html\"><u>already existed in 40 states</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to Kent Masterson Brown, <a href=\"http://www.kentmbrown.com/\"><u>a health care litigator</u></a> invited by South Carolina lawmakers to help them avoid implementing Obamacare, the programs suggest overzealous nonprofits telling parents how to raise their children without their consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown raises the specter of a home-schooling family subject to &quot;intervention&quot; for school readiness, their children forced into schools and onto medications and vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The federal government will now set the standards for raising children and will enforce them by home visits,&quot; he wrote about the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But consent is built into the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A home visitor could no more compel a family to vaccinate kids than a pediatrician could, said Kay Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School who&rsquo;s one of the nation&rsquo;s experts on state home visiting policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what the <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3590enr.txt.pdf\"><u>Affordable Care Act </u></a>says: Home-visiting programs must assure they&rsquo;ll have procedures that ensure &quot;<em>the participation of each eligible family in the program is voluntary</em>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how that might work, according to Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, who supports such programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A low-income mom gets her prenatal care at a community health center. Her doctor asks if she would like visits from a nurse after the baby comes to offer tips and answer questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mom could say yes &mdash; or no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s like the old days of health care, Rosenbaum said, when nurses would visit families to show how to breastfeed, sterilize bottles, care for babies and cope when you&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s real health education in the home, is the purpose of it,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such programs have a long history backed by peer-reviewed research, she said. They work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They make sure that you don&#39;t go home to nothing. It&#39;s done to help families, not to police them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/child/PublicDocuments/visit_3.authcheckdam.pdf\"><u>classic randomized trial</u></a> in Elmira, N.Y., showed nurse visits to families of newborns reduced child abuse and neglect, even years later. They also reduced government spending for low-income unmarried women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, the lawyer, says he&rsquo;s concerned families have no protection from social workers. He&rsquo;s concerned workers won&rsquo;t be well-trained and will overstep families&rsquo; rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody should knock on your door without a badge, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What I see in this is a monster, frankly. And you can quote me on that,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law, however, specifies that programs be voluntary, their staffs trained and supervised, and the <a href=\"http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/\"><u>home-visiting models</u></a> they follow based on strong research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any &quot;forced home inspection&quot; wouldn&rsquo;t be under the law &mdash; it would be in direct opposition to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if a family welcomed help but later decided it made them uncomfortable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samantha Miller, a spokeswoman for the U.S. agency administering the program, said families could stop accepting services &quot;without consequence at any time and for any reason.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers passed around a claim last week that a provision of the new health care law will allow &quot;forced&quot; home inspections by government agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the program they pointed to provides grants for voluntary help to at-risk families from trained staff like nurses and social workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What bloggers describe would be an egregious abuse of the law &mdash; not what&rsquo;s allowed by it.
