W. Bush spoke at his inauguration in 1989 of &quot;individuals and community organizations spread like stars through the nation doing good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of that vision came the nonprofit Points of Light. And out of Points of Light came Michelle Nunn, a Georgia native with a do-gooder resume, political pedigree and desire to be the state&rsquo;s next U.S. senator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a new television ad, Nunn, a Democrat, criticizes the business tactics of millionaire David Perdue, her Republican opponent in the race to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TV ad begins by introducing Nunn as &quot;CEO of the world&rsquo;s largest volunteer organization.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That line gave pause to a PolitiFact reader, who contacted us to say he was pretty confident that the international Red Cross, not Points of Light, holds that distinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We truthfully had no idea but promised to investigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a little on the very different work undertaken by the two nonprofits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Red Cross, the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian organization, is best known for promoting blood donations and for being on the scene when disaster strikes with food, clothing and temporary housing assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Points of Light, President Bush&rsquo;s brainchild, mobilizes volunteers through a network of 250 volunteer action centers worldwide, through its programs for youth and national service alumni and through its partnerships with thousands of companies and nonprofits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn, daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, has been its CEO since 2007, when it merged with the Hands on Network, a nonprofit she helped create and ran. She&rsquo;s on leave from Points of Light while campaigning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On its website, Points of Light says it had 4 million volunteers worldwide in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, shows a volunteer force worldwide of about 17 million, including 501,208 in North America. (We got that data by adding up country-by-country data we found on its website.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benoit Matsha-Carpentier, a spokesman for the organization in Geneva, Switzerland, confirmed the accuracy of our math. He provided a Red Cross powerpoint presentation, showing the organization had 17.1 million volunteers around the globe in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can Points of Light claim to the &quot;world&rsquo;s largest volunteer organization?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Points of Light routinely provides a much more nuanced description of its work, although the campaign pointed us to at least two instances -- one in 2007 and one in 2012 -- where the nonprofit did refer to itself as the &quot;world&rsquo;s largest volunteer organization.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, on its web site and elsewhere, Points of Light is identified as &quot;the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a title the group is confident it can claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are unaware of any other organization solely dedicated to volunteer service that is using such a wide range of assets to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of the work they do,&quot; Stefanie Weiss, Points of Light spokeswoman, said in an email. &quot;We say that &#39;Points of Light is the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service.&#39; We work with millions of people and tens of thousands of partner organizations to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of the work they do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Pollak, senior research associate at the Urban Institute&rsquo;s Center for Nonprofits and Charitable Organizations, said the ad&rsquo;s description of Points of Light &quot;doesn&rsquo;t strike me as patently disingenuous or deceptive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he said Points of Light&rsquo;s description of itself as the &quot;the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service&quot; seems more accurate and &quot;a little less subject&quot; to being misconstrued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on volunteerism should be viewed with some skepticism, Pollak said. That&rsquo;s because some people can be involved in long-term volunteering. Others may be involved in a single event, such as a weekend helping to build a home for a needy family, and the organization may not be keeping careful track of the number of participants, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relying on data reported by non-profits on their federal tax forms, Pollak was able to provide us with a <a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/volunteers/\">list </a>of the 25 nonprofits reporting the highest number of volunteers, nationwide. No. 1 was the American Heart Association with 22 million volunteers, followed by the Muscular Dystrophy Association Inc. with 15 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pollak said he wasn&rsquo;t aware of information available to do a similar comparison on a worldwide scale. And the Red Cross&rsquo;s 17.1 million volunteers doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a record just based on the numbers U.S. organizations use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where does that leave us?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Points of Light has a unique mission carved out by President Bush -- mobilizing volunteers around the world. Nunn has used her stewardship of the non-profit to burnish her leadership credentials in the race against businessman Perdue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But her political ad undercuts how Points of Light describes itself on its website &nbsp;-- &nbsp;as &quot;the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service.&quot;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s substantially different from the world&rsquo;s largest volunteer organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.We rate the ad statement as Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-25T14:37:42.062511", "ruling_date": "2014-08-26T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Nunn's ad claim misses the mark", "ruling_headline_slug": "nunns-ad-claim-misses-mark", "ruling_link_text": "Worldwide, millions volunteer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Nunn ad, &quot;David Perdue&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.michellenunn.com/news/press-releases/new-ad-david-perdues-real-world-doesnt-include-you\">real</a> world doesn&rsquo;t include you.&quot;<br />\r\nEmails with Stefanie Weiss, chief communications and marketing officer, Points of Light, Washington D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Tom Pollak, program director, National Center for Charitable Statistics, senior research association, Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email with Benoit Matsha-Carpentier,team leader, public communications and outreach,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presentation from the International <a href=\"http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/22/35/23/Corporate_presentation.jpg\">Federation</a> of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International <a href=\"http://www.unhrd.org/?page_id=853\">organizations</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Merger of Hands On Network and Points of Light Foundation to Create World&rsquo;s Largest Volunteer Organization,&quot; July 16th, 2007 press <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081127103908/http:/www.pointsoflight.org/about/mediacenter/releases/2007/07-16-2.cfm\">release</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<strong>About Points of Light </strong>Points of <a href=\"http://www.pointsoflight.org/press-releases/points-light-itt-exelis-corporation-national-community-service-and-55-organizations\">Light</a> is the world&#39;s largest volunteer organization with more than 20 years of history and a bipartisan presidential legacy,&quot; Aug. 20th, 2012 press release</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Chief Executive Officer, Points of Light Foundation", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michelle", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2356, "last_name": "Nunn", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "michelle-nunn", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Michelle_Nunn2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2356/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p><strong>Points of Light is &nbsp;&quot;the world&rsquo;s largest volunteer organization.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "television ad", "statement_date": "2014-08-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
