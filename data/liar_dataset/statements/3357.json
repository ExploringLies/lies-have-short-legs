Allen West from District 22 and Rep. Frederica Wilson from District 17, both in Southeastern Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWilson, the Miami Democrat who was elected to Congress for the first time in November, recalled how, when she was principal at Skyway Elementary&nbsp;in the Carol City neighborhood outside Miami, Miami-Dade County permitted a garbage plant to be built across the street from her school.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe outcome, she said in the<em> Washington Post </em>article: &nbsp;&quot;We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe knew Wilson had a long track record as an educator before turning to politics. But she had a hand in closing a multimillion-dollar plant? We&nbsp;had to check it out.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe plant in question was called Agripost and was built in November 1988 across the street from Skyway,&nbsp;the Carol City&nbsp;elementary school. Wilson, a veteran with the school system, was the principal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCounty Hall had hoped that Agripost would help solve Miami-Dade&rsquo;s trash problems by turning household trash into compost through a process of shredding and fermenting. The plant was to use the composting technology to convert household garbage into a soil additive for agricultural use.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The county was looking for innovative ways to deal with the waste,&quot; Clerk of the Courts Harvey Ruvin, who then served as a commissioner, said in an interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it didn&#39;t turn out as planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter it opened, the plant at 20600 NW 47th Ave. emitted an odor that troubled Wilson and her students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It was awful,&quot; Wilson said by telephone. &quot;It smelled like rotting eggs and dog poo.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd so the students made phone calls, wrote letters to government officials, and showed up at commission and school board meetings in red &quot;Skyway&quot; T-shirts. They stood on their tiptoes to reach the microphones.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;She was very forceful on behalf of the children, as I recall,&quot; Ruvin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNewspaper accounts credit Wilson for leading the charge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What was the plant&#39;s biggest nemesis?&quot; a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>report asked in a December 1991&nbsp;article. &quot;The Skyway Elementary School across the street. Principal Frederica Wilson is a self-proclaimed environmentalist. But she claimed a stench from the plant permeated school grounds, causing children to vomit or have nosebleeds, and she led a revolt against the plant.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe plant closed in January 1991, barely two years after it opened. One report in the&nbsp;<em>Miami Herald</em>, on Nov. 25, 1990, said Agripost spent $20 million to build the plant. Another, on Dec. 23, 1990, said it was a $25 million plant.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAgripost appealed the commission&#39;s decision, and in 1994 sued the county for $140 million. According to a <em>Miami Herald </em>report on Oct. 4, 1994, the lawsuit claimed the company had&nbsp;invested $40 million in the plant and also sought $100 million in damages for the &quot;destruction of the company&quot; when county commissioners voted to revoke the company&rsquo;s zoning authorization. The decision threw Agripost into bankruptcy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWilson said, &quot;We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down.&quot; (As for the different estimates for the cost of the plant, Wilson said by phone: &quot;You know how long that&rsquo;s been? I don&rsquo;t remember everything.&quot;)&nbsp;But after 20 years, her memory in&nbsp;the <em>Washington Post </em>article was on target.
