In North Carolina, first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, is already facing attacks about Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab2E2lZzbH8\"><u>released an ad</u></a> against Hagan. It starts out with a series of claims praising women for being breadwinners and job creators. Then, it pivots: &quot;But Kay Hagan just doesn&rsquo;t get it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hagan supports waivers for friends of Obama and special treatment for Congress and their staffs,&quot; the video continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hagan did <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396\"><u>vote</u></a> to pass Obamacare in 2010, but does the law include &quot;waivers for friends of Obama&quot; and &quot;special treatment for Congress and their staffs&quot;? We&rsquo;ll look into both parts of this statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Waivers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/18/mick-mulvaney/rep-mulvaney-says-obama-gave-1100-special-waivers-/\"><u>fact-checked</u></a> the claim that the president handed out waivers to his friends. The law did lead to the granting of more than 1,000 waivers, but they weren&rsquo;t issued to groups on the basis of being Obama&rsquo;s friends or political allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the law allowed for groups to apply for an exemption so that they can keep their cheap insurance plans, even though they don&rsquo;t typically cover the &quot;10 essential benefits&quot; like maternity care and mental health care that Obamacare touts. These waivers expire on Jan. 1, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some but not all of these groups could be considered Obama&rsquo;s political allies, so using the term &quot;friends&quot; is at the very least<strong> </strong>misleading. Many unions, which typically lean Democratic, made the list. They make up about a third of the waivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Files/Downloads/Employer_01062012.pdf\"><u>recipients</u></a> also include groups like the Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina, Pepsi and McDonald&rsquo;s. The common denominator with most of those who received waivers<strong> </strong>seems to be low-wage workers. As far as we can tell, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that &quot;friendship&quot; played a role, or that these companies are Obama&rsquo;s political allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 100 groups, including several unions, were <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Files/Downloads/denials_01062012.pdf\"><u>denied waivers</u></a>. There&rsquo;s also a sizable number of groups that were denied waivers, then were accepted the second time around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health and Human Services issues these waivers. Hagan and other legislators don&#39;t have a say. Hagan&#39;s spokeswoman told us the senator has never spoken out in favor of the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Special treatment for Congress</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has also looked at claims <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-obama-just-granted-all-congress-/\"><u>similar</u></a> to Americans For Prosperity&rsquo;s assertion that Congress gets &quot;special treatment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That implies that legislators and their staffs aren&rsquo;t subject to the health care reform&rsquo;s individual mandate when in fact they are. It&rsquo;s more accurate to say that Congress is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/24/facebook-posts/congress-criminals-scientologists-and-other-groups/\"><u>one of several</u></a> special cases under the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this exception actually requires Congress to buy insurance on the marketplace instead of keeping&nbsp;employer-provided benefits from the federal government. Lawmakers still get a subsidy toward their policies. Without the subsidy, the change in coverage would have effectively been a pay cut of thousands of dollars per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words,<strong> </strong>the law singles out Congress and forces members off their employer-provided plan<strong> </strong>in favor of the marketplace options, even though all other Americans<strong> </strong>with employee-provided health coverage can keep it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In defense of the ad, Americans for Prosperity wrote, &quot;The &lsquo;subsidy&rsquo; is not the problem. &hellip; Congress and its staff are enjoying an option not available to the rest of the nation.&quot; They cite the fact that businesses with more than 50 employees can&rsquo;t yet access group plans on the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/what-is-the-shop-marketplace/\"><u>Small Business Health Options Program</u></a>, the marketplace the legislators will use. But this policy allows legislators to experience Obamacare&#39;s individual mandate alongside their constituents. We don&#39;t see a case that they&#39;re getting special treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 1,000 companies have received Obamacare waivers, but there&rsquo;s no evidence to suggest that those groups are all Obama&rsquo;s &quot;friends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Congress and their staffs do have to adhere to the reform&rsquo;s individual mandate, and in a key way are treated worse than other Americans by the law, which is a curious definition of &quot;special treatment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Americans For Prosperity&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-07T12:12:51.275389", "ruling_date": "2013-11-07T16:04:40", "ruling_headline": "Americans For Prosperity says Sen.
