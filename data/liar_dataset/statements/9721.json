Clarke Jr.&rsquo;s own words to suggest he&rsquo;s encouraging gun violence by discouraging use of the 911 emergency response system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t dial 911,&quot; Clarke says in a clip featured in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GS7ZpzUrCM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">the ad</a>. &quot;I will afterwards, to say &lsquo;Come get this dead guy out of my house, he&rsquo;s bleeding out and he&rsquo;s messing up my carpet.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad ends with another excerpt from that interview: &quot;Point that barrel (at) center mass and pull the trigger.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of the spot, a narrator says: &quot;Emergency responders. They risk their lives every day to help save ours. But <a href=\"http://www.thepeoplessheriff.com/\">Sheriff David Clarke</a> says 911 is not our best option.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does the new ad, paid for by the union-backed <a href=\"http://www.greaterwisconsin.org/\">Greater Wisconsin Committee</a>, accurately reflect Clarke&rsquo;s views?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, has Clarke advised citizens to &quot;point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger&quot; because &quot;911 is not our best option?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A familiar controversy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke faces Milwaukee Police lieutenant <a href=\"http://www.moewsforsheriff.com/\">Chris Moews</a> in the Democratic primary for sheriff on Aug. 12, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new ad resurrects a controversy that began in January 2013 when <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/sheriff-clarkes-ads-urging-people-to-arm-themselves-will-be-paid-by-taxpayers-0l8ssbk-192606571.html\">Clarke&rsquo;s office paid for a radio announcement</a> in which he said: &quot;With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. But are you prepared?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That prompted a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/sheriff-clarke-urges-residents-to-arm-themselves-with-guns-o38h47h-188375091.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story</a> with this online headline: &quot;Sheriff David Clarke&rsquo;s radio ad says 911 not best option, urges residents to take firearms classes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Clarke&rsquo;s radio spot, Milwaukee Mayor Tom <a href=\"http://fox6now.com/2013/01/26/mayor-barrett-responds-to-sheriff-clarkes-psa/\">Barrett criticized him</a>, saying if there&rsquo;s an emergency, &quot;I want people to call 911&quot; but Sheriff Clarke is &quot;discouraging people from calling 911, it&rsquo;s just wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About six weeks later, Clarke sat for a long interview with <a href=\"https://www.projectveritas.com/about/\">Project Veritas</a>, a conservative group. that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saBdw0VXk6g\">posted it online</a>. The snippets of Clarke speaking in the Greater Wisconsin ad are from this interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that interview, Clarke said that Barrett had &quot;contorted&quot; the message in his radio spot by suggesting that he was advising that nobody call 911.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheriff explained that it&rsquo;s up to individual citizens to decide for themselves what they will do when confronted with possible harm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, Clarke made it clear not only what he personally would do, but what he would advise as the best course of action for citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He spoke in the context of potentially immediate danger, an example being an intruder breaking into your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twice he said the &quot;advice&quot; he would give people was based on what he himself would do:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Use cover, because you don&rsquo;t know if that clown trying to break into your house is armed. Know who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He does not mention calling 911 in that sequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he concludes: &quot;You see, the thing is 911 in that situation is not going to help you and that&rsquo;s why I said it&rsquo;s not your best option.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the ad, notably, gets the &quot;not your best option&quot; context right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other Clarke quote in the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad is from a section of the Project Veritas interview in which Clarke talks more about what he personally would do in that situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke tells the interviewer that a sign hangs on his own home picturing the head of a Rottweiler and a semiautomatic handgun with the message: &quot;We don&rsquo;t dial 911.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t call 911,&quot; Clarke explained. &quot;I will afterwards, to say &lsquo;Come get this dead guy out of my house, he&rsquo;s bleeding out and he&rsquo;s messing up my carpet. And that&rsquo;s not to sound, you know &hellip; that&rsquo;s just the reality. I&rsquo;m not going to fool around with that. But that&rsquo;s the mindset I have but I&rsquo;ve been a cop for 35 years, so I live with that every day and it becomes second nature...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheriff, at that point in the interview, shifts back to what he&rsquo;d like law abiding residents to consider doing. Government shouldn&rsquo;t tell them what to do, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I trust them to make those decisions as to what to do,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;If they want to blow a whistle, fine, I don&rsquo;t tell them not to.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he made clear that he feels the best option is not waiting around for the police, or hiding under the bed, or running away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to be very effective in some of these situations,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;So I want people to think about what&rsquo;s going to be effective. If you want to run out of your house, fine, I&rsquo;m not running out of my house unless it&rsquo;s on fire. That&rsquo;s my house, and I&rsquo;m not running from it to give the bad guy carte blanche.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ad vs. reality</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does the Greater Wisconsin ad compare to Clarke&rsquo;s statements?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad, despite the length limitations, gets Clarke&rsquo;s message right and places it in the context -- using Clarke&rsquo;s own words -- of a home invasion situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither Clarke nor the ad is saying the sheriff suggests that calling 911 is never a good idea. (Clarke, in the interview, at one point seems to suggest he wants average citizens to call 911 if they can -- but then take matters into their own hands rather than wait for police to arrive).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other Clarke quote in the ad -- &quot;point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger&quot; -- is in fact Clarke&rsquo;s advice to citizens. He says a 911 call isn&rsquo;t &nbsp;always possible and by itself isn&rsquo;t effective because of long wait times for police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Clarke to respond to the ad, he said he stands behind what he said to Project Veritas and did not intend to watch the Greater Wisconsin ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke said he suspected the ad twisted his remarks, but he couldn&rsquo;t recall the specific context of his comments in the interview cited in the ad, and he offered no specific criticisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My position is clear,&quot; Clarke said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Greater Wisconsin Committee ad said Sheriff David Clarke advised citizens to &quot;point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger&quot; because &quot;911 is not our best option.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke did just that in an interview, and made similar comments in an earlier radio spot and in comments to PolitiFact Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-06T12:05:08.340404", "ruling_date": "2014-08-07T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Group says Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke said calling 911 not best option", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-says-sheriff-david-clarke-said-calling-911-n", "ruling_link_text": "Clarke stands by his position", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Greater Wisconsin Committee, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GS7ZpzUrCM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">TV ad</a>, Aug. 5, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Milwaukee County Sheriff David A.
