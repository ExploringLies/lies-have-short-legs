Jerry Brown&rsquo;s signature the bill will go into effect in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Golden State&rsquo;s per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked for evidence, Patterson&rsquo;s spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates<a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/state-gasoline-tax-rates-2016/\"> produced in March 2016</a> by the nonprofit Tax Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That map and its numbers, however, are outdated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A map<a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/state-gasoline-tax-rates-2017/\"> produced in January 2017</a> by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates.&nbsp;Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/8640286/Gas%20Taxes%20By%20State.JPG\" style=\"height:649px; width:725px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58&nbsp;cents. California&rsquo;s current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California&rsquo;s tax will trail Pennsylvania&rsquo;s by 8&nbsp;cents per gallon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You won&rsquo;t be No. 1, that&rsquo;s for sure,&quot; said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. &quot;Pennsylvania will still be the highest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.api.org/~/media/Files/Statistics/State-Motor-Fuel-Taxes-Report-Jan-2017.pdf\">chart produced in January 2017</a> by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation&rsquo;s figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on current rates, California&rsquo;s increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at that topic in a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2017/apr/06/could-gas-tax-hike-leave-california-highest-fuel-p/\"> recent article</a>. As of this week, California&rsquo;s average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii&rsquo;s $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state&rsquo;s gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which &quot;would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania,&quot; Henchman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California&rsquo;s recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the &quot;highest gas tax in the nation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patterson relied on outdated gas tax rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/state-gasoline-tax-rates-2017/\">Current figures</a> from the Tax Foundation show California&rsquo;s per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania&rsquo;s rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These figures are also <a href=\"http://www.api.org/~/media/Files/Statistics/State-Motor-Fuel-Taxes-Report-Jan-2017.pdf\">confirmed</a> by the American Petroleum Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, we rate Patterson&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California&rsquo;s new legislation. It concluded &quot;Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin.&quot; This latest update factors in <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/articles/2017/04/26/drivers-could-feel-more-pain-at-pump-than-expected-due-to-gas-tax-increase/\">an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase</a> that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The state&rsquo;s full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California&rsquo;s overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation&rsquo;s latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson&#39;s claim as False as the foundation concluded&nbsp;this higher&nbsp;California gas tax, even in 2019, would &nbsp;be &quot;just behind Pennsylvania&#39;s highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">more</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-11T14:19:43.622812", "ruling_date": "2017-04-11T11:55:07", "ruling_headline": "Will California soon have the highest gas tax in the nation?
