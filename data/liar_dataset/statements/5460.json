Among the officials was U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who praised the soldiers &nbsp;for &quot;serving with great distinction&quot; and then shared a fact about the Rhode Island National Guard.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite hailing from the smallest state in the nation, he said, &quot;they are the second most heavily deployed National Guard in the United States.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe have heard this claim made before about the Rhode Island National Guard -- in Journal stories and in speeches by state officials -- and decided to find out whether it&rsquo;s really true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be clear, although he didn&rsquo;t say it at the ceremony at Quonset, Whitehouse was referring to per-capita deployments. That phrase -- per-capita deployments -- is what he used in a<a href=\"http://whitehouse.senate.gov/newsroom/speeches/speech/?id=b5234649-5984-45f1-8c4f-35a15f1e909a\"> speech</a> on the Senate floor in November, and it is the same language used by other public officials, including former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhitehouse&rsquo;s office told us they got the information on deployments from the Rhode Island National Guard and directed us to a<a href=\"http://www.eastbayri.com/news/2011/dec/15/ri-national-guard-celebrates-375-years/\"> letter to the editor</a> published Dec. 15 in The Bristol Phoenix to mark the 375th anniversary of the National Guard.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Rhode Island, with slightly more than 3,200 National Guard members, has the nation&rsquo;s second highest per-capita deployment rate as we have answered the call to more than 5,600 deployment requests,&quot; Maj. Gen. Kevin R. McBride, adjutant general of the Rhode Island National Guard, wrote in the letter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLt. Col. Denis J. Riel, spokesman for the Rhode Island National Guard, told us the information came from a Department of Defense document that looked at per-capita deployments for each of the nation&rsquo;s 50 states and 4 territories. Specifically, the analysis, which Riel said was released before 2010, divided the number of deployments for each state or territory by its number of Guard personnel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRiel tried to track down a copy of the document for us, but couldn&rsquo;t find it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I can assure you that the Senator has heard us repeat this fact multiple times and we were likely the source of it,&quot; he said in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called the National Guard Bureau in Arlington, Va., &nbsp;and asked whether it or another branch of the Department of Defense had indeed done a state-by-state analysis of deployment rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile we waited for a response, we tracked down a per-capita analysis of Army National Guard deployments done in 2007 by the National Journal, a nonpartisan magazine on politics. (Air National Guard troops were not included because they typically deploy for short periods instead of the 12-month or longer deployments normal for the Army Guard, according to a<a href=\"http://www3.nationaljournal.com/scripts/printpage.cgi?/members/news/2007/12/1214nj2.htm\"> story</a> that explained the analysis.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe analysis used National Guard data to look at overseas deployments from Sept. 11, 2001, onward. It took into account multiple deployments by any individual service member -- if a soldier was deployed twice, he or she was counted twice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHawaii topped the<a href=\"http://www3.nationaljournal.com/img/pdfs/071214_deploy_rate.pdf\"> list</a> with 976 deployments for every 1,000 soldiers in its Army National Guard. Rhode Island came in second with 883 deployments per 1,000, followed by South Dakota, Maine and Washington state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the magazine, the 350,000-member Army National Guard had deployed soldiers a total of approximately 190,000 times nationwide, for a national average of about 550 deployments per 1,000 soldiers. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPopulous states, such as Texas or California, were far down the list of deployments per capita, while smaller states were generally near the top.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reason for the high rates of deployments in some states and not others had to do with the types of units in each state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;National Guard forces in different states have different kinds of units,&quot; the National Journal&rsquo;s story says. &quot;Some states have more infantry brigades or military police; others have more artillery or tank units. ... Historical accident, local tradition, and varying levels of education among a state&#39;s population also factor into the mix. Some kinds of units are in high demand for Iraq and Afghanistan; other types are called up much less frequently.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHawaii had a high rate because it has a concentration of combat arms units. South Dakota&rsquo;s rate was also high because it has engineers, artillery soldiers and transportation units, all of which were heavily needed in Iraq.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd what about Rhode Island and its 3,200 Guard members?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;... our force structure here in [Rhode Island] is unique in that we have what are commonly known as combat support units which are typically called into the fight with direct combat units,&quot; Riel, the Rhode Island National Guard spokesman, said in an email. &quot;These are Field Artillery, Military Police, Combat Engineers, General Purpose helicopters, and on the Air Guard side, Tactical airlift and combat communications units.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to Riel, more Rhode Island Guard members have been deployed since 9/11 than any other individual conflict since the Civil War. Seven Rhode Island Army National Guard units, totaling 540 soldiers, are currently deployed in Kuwait and Afghanistan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Journal analysis is five years old, but we couldn&rsquo;t find any new study of deployment rates that had been done since then. (We never heard back from the National Guard Bureau.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the rates in other states increased in a similar fashion to Rhode Island&rsquo;s -- and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe they didn&rsquo;t -- then the rankings in 2007, in all likelihood, are the same today. Rhode Island then would still have the second-highest number of deployments per capita in the nation. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLacking any evidence to the contrary, we rate Whitehouse&rsquo;s claim True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
