Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., criticized a Republican push for a balanced budget amendment. He said Congress should not be hasty about amending the Constitution and noted that only a tiny number of amendments ultimately pass.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;ve had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789. Twenty-seven amendments have been passed, 10 of them in one shot with the Bill of Rights. And so, we&rsquo;re now hearing that Republicans may want two, three days before they plunge us into the economic abyss, propose the eleven-thousand and first constitutional amendment so that in less than three days we pass that when it&rsquo;s taken over 230 years to pass 27 out of the 11,000 that were proposed,&quot; Rep. Becerra said, adding, &quot;That&rsquo;s the height of ridicule.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecerra was later named to the &quot;super committee&quot; that is developing a plan to comply with the budget cuts required by the debt ceiling vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we get to the numbers, it&rsquo;s worth reviewing the process for amending the U.S. Constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmendments can be proposed two ways: in Congress or by a national convention assembled at the request of the two-thirds of the states legislatures. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe national convention approach <a href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No3_Rogersonline.pdf\">has been attempted twice</a> but has never been successful. So the successful amendments have all originated in Congress. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd according to a congressional tally, Becerra is just about right on target: Congress has considered &quot;approximately 11,372 amendments&quot; from 1789 through December 31, 2008, the most recent tally available, according to the <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/measures_proposed_to_amend_constitution.htm\">Statistics and Lists</a> section of the United States Senate website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy is it &quot;approximately&quot; 11,372? The site says that&#39;s because of a number of factors, including inadequate indexing of legislation in the early years of Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf those 11,372 proposed amendments, only 27 have been approved by Congress and ratified by the states. Why such a low success rate? Senate Historian Donald Ritchie told us that amending the Constitution is &quot;an extremely complicated process&quot; and an amendment &quot;essentially only gets adopted when there&rsquo;s a broad national consensus on the issue.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt agreed, noting that &quot;the founders wanted the bar set high because they believed that most issues should be left to the ordinary political process. A constitutional amendment takes an issue away from the normal process of democratic politics, quite likely forever. So it makes sense to require an extraordinary consensus to resolve it permanently.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost proposals aren&rsquo;t inspired by a broad national consensus, however. The motivation for introducing a constitutional amendment is often political. &quot;Every time the Supreme Court makes a ruling some member of Congress doesn&rsquo;t like, someone pushes for a constitutional amendment on the matter,&quot; Ritchie told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, the day after the Supreme Court <a href=\"http://supreme.justia.com/us/491/397/case.html\">ruled</a> flag burning to be protected speech in 1989, U.S. Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., introduced an amendment <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.101hjres302\">outlawing desecration of the flag</a>. Amendments to ban flag burning have been introduced in every session of Congress since, spanning more than two decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany amendments are introduced many times. An amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman has been introduced numerous times in the last decade, including <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.110hjres89\">four times in a single session of Congress</a>. Some are introduced many times but with variations. Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, members of Congress introduced amendments that would <a href=\"http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/proposals/proposals.html#1\">provide for the continuity of Congress in the event of a sudden mass vacancy in the Capitol</a>. The amendments varied on what constituted that &quot;mass vacancy&quot; and how replacement lawmakers would be chosen. None of the amendments passed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBack to Becerra. He was correct that only a tiny percentage of amendments ultimately pass and are ratified. He said 11,000; the official count puts the number at approximately 11,372. That&#39;s close enough to earn a True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-30T11:25:52.825410", "ruling_date": "2011-08-30T11:38:21", "ruling_headline": "Of 11,000 attempts to amend U.S. Constitution, only 27 amendments have passed", "ruling_headline_slug": "11000-attempts-amend-us-constitution-only-27-amend", "ruling_link_text": "Only 0.2 percent of tries actually get ratified", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic Caucus, <a href=\"http://www.dems.gov/press/democratic-leaders-say-house-democrats-are-united-against-gop-default-act\">Transcript of Press Availability After House Democratic Caucus Meeting</a>, July 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Archives, <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html\">Constitution of the United States</a>, full text<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJames Rogers, <a href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol30_No3_Rogersonline.pdf\">&quot;The Other Way to Amend the Constitution: The Article V Constitutional Convention Amendment Process&quot;</a>, published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, pages 1009-1010, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnited States Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/stats_and_lists.htm\">Statistics &amp; Lists</a><a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/measures_proposed_to_amend_constitution.htm\">: Measures Proposed to Amend the Constitution</a>, &nbsp;Accessed Aug. 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnited States Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Constitution_vrd.htm\">Virtual Reference Desk</a>, Accessed August 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnited States Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/House_Member_Introduces_Resolution_To_Abolish_the_Senate.htm\">Art &amp; History: Historical Minutes</a>, Accessed August 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with United States Senate Historian Donald Ritchie, August 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Professor Kermit Roosevelt, August 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLibrary of Congress, <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.101hjres302\">H.J.
