Chuck Schumer was busted by his own daughter for having an affair with a teenager, according to a fake news story making the rounds on Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Update: Chuck Schumer&rsquo;s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed,&quot; stated a <a href=\"http://usainfront.com/update-chuck-schumers-steamy-affair-with-a-high-school-cheerleader-confirmed/\">headline</a> in USA In Front Dec. 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news. This fake story had been shared more than 30,000 times on Facebook within just a few days. Schumer&rsquo;s spokesman declined to comment to PolitiFact, and no one from the website responded to our email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story stated that Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with his daughter Lisa&rsquo;s best friend from high school, a 16-year-old who later committed suicide. Schumer&rsquo;s wife, Kaitlyn, paid the girl&rsquo;s mother $2 million, the article stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, <a href=\"https://www.schumer.senate.gov/about-chuck\">Schumer&rsquo;s wife is named Iris</a> and his daughters are <a href=\"https://www.schumer.senate.gov/about-chuck\">Jessica and Alison</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA In Front claims proof via the cheerleader&rsquo;s mother and Planned Parenthood records, but offers no actual evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article portrays Schumer as a hypocrite for opposing the candidacy of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost the Alabama race Dec. 12. In November, the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.c65aa6660dd6\">Washington Post</a> </em>reported that Moore, while he was in his 30s, had pursued relationships with teenage girls, according to the women. Several<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/11/fake-news-alabama-senate-race-surges-election-day/\"> fake news stories</a> have made up claims related to Moore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article appears to be a rip off of an earlier version on <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.online/2017/12/08/lisa-turns-on-daddy/\">Last Line of Defense</a>, a notorious <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/may/31/If-youre-fooled-by-fake-news-this-man-probably-wro/\">fake news website</a> that identifies itself as satire. That version had some more fictional details such as that Schumer spent a ton of money on the girl at Steak and Shake and Victoria&rsquo;s Secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These fake news stories about Schumer having an affair with a teenage teenager were posted a few days before an unrelated story in the <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/us/politics/schumer-fraudulent-document-harassment.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">New York Times</a></em> about false allegations by a former Schumer staff member of sexual harassment by Schumer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer&rsquo;s staff filed a report to the Capitol Police that a fraudulent document that resembled a court filing described false allegations. The former staff member told the <em>New York Times</em> that the harassment claims were &quot;completely false.&quot; The former staff member spoke to the <em>New York Times</em> on the condition of anonymity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline stated that &quot;Chuck Schumer&rsquo;s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed.&quot; There actually is no confirmation of such an event. Many of the alleged details in the story are flat-out wrong. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-17T14:29:12.293307", "ruling_date": "2017-12-18T11:04:11", "ruling_headline": "Fake news says Chuck Schumer had affair with teenage cheerleader", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-news-says-chuck-schumer-had-affair-teenage-ch", "ruling_link_text": "No cheers for fake news", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>USA In Front, <a href=\"http://usainfront.com/update-chuck-schumers-steamy-affair-with-a-high-school-cheerleader-confirmed/\">&quot;Update: Chuck Schumer&rsquo;s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed,&quot;</a> Dec. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Sen.
