Rub&eacute;n Hinojosa of<strong> </strong>Mercedes in the South Texas district. EMILY&#39;s List President Stephanie Schriock praised Elizondo&rsquo;s record, according to a Feb. 1, 2016, Texas Tribune <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2016/02/01/emilys-list-endorses-south-texas-congressional-rac/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news story</u></a>, and also suggested a greater significance to Elizondo&rsquo;s candidacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Texas is home to millions of Latinas,&quot; Schriock said, &quot;but the state has never elected a Latina to Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is all of that so?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Latina population</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a sense of Latina Texans, we reached out to the Office of the Texas State Demographer, which by email <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yIRfPw2M72f0X91S-r7GKallFYXIZiOAE3hWcGZpG68/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>provided us</u></a> with a few different data sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s one-year survey, Texas&rsquo; Hispanic or Latino population in 2014 numbered 10.4 million--with the female Hispanic population that year totaling nearly 5.2 million residents. Put another way, Latinos comprised about 39 percent of the state&rsquo;s nearly 27 million residents in 2014, <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>per the bureau</u></a>, with Latinas accounting for 19 percent of residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Texas State Data Center&rsquo;s own most recent population estimate, for 2013, put the female Hispanic population at 5.1 million, and the entire Hispanic population at 10.3 million. It&rsquo;s worth noting that that number included nearly 1.7 million minors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upshot: Texas has lately been home to more than 5 million Latinas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Texas representatives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To check Texas&rsquo; history of congressional representation, we asked EMILY&rsquo;s List for its backup for Schriock&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman, Rachel Thomas, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yIRfPw2M72f0X91S-r7GKallFYXIZiOAE3hWcGZpG68/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said by email</u></a> that Texas through history has elected three women of color to the House and none to the Senate--and each of the elected women were African-American.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A web search led us to a <a href=\"http://history.house.gov/Exhibition-and-Publications/WIC/Women-in-Congress/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>searchable history</u></a> of women in Congress, also cited by Thomas, posted at history.house.gov.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That history showed that through 2015, Texas, a state since 1845, had elected seven women to the House, including current Republican<strong> </strong>Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth and Democratic Reps.<strong> </strong>Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas and Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston. Historically, too, four of Texas&rsquo; congresswomen were white, three were black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a similar <a href=\"http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/HAIC/Hispanic-Americans-in-Congress/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>history of Hispanic Americans in Congress</u></a> on the House website:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--Seventeen Hispanic<strong> </strong>Texans, all men, have won election to Congress including current Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Houston as well as Republican Rep. Bill Flores of Bryan<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Democratic Reps. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio, Henry Cuellar of Laredo, Filemon Vela of Brownsville, and Hinojosa, whose seat Elizondo seeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--The first Latino elected to the House from Texas was Henry B. Gonz&aacute;lez of San Antonio, who served from 1961 into early 1999. With 37 years in the House, he also was the longest-serving Hispanic member of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--The first woman to represent Texas was Lera Millard Thomas of Nacogdoches, a Democrat who won 74 percent of the vote in a special election to serve out nine months remaining in<strong> </strong>her husband Albert Richard Thomas&rsquo; term upon his death in 1966. The first woman of color to represent Texas was Houston&rsquo;s Barbara Jordan, who was elected to the House in 1973 with 81 percent of the vote and served until 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--Nationally, 107 Latinos and 313 women have served in Congress, counting 11 Latinas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--The 11 Latinas to have served in Congress -- all in the House: Washington Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, New Mexico Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham, New York Democrat Nydia M. Vel&aacute;zquez, and California Democrats Grace Flores Napolitano, Gloria Negrette McLeod, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Loretta Sanchez, Linda T. S&aacute;nchez, Hilda L. Solis and Norma Judith Torres.
