Crist for  supporting the plan, which used tax cuts and federal spending to try to  jump-start the economy. Rubio has said that Crist \"breathed air into the  sails of the failed Democrat plan, while deflating Republican efforts  to rally behind an alternative.\"<br /><br />To turn the tables, Crist's  campaign issued a satirical news release written <a href=\"http://charliecrist.com/2010/02/remarks-by-speaker-rubio-before-cpac/\" target=\"_blank\">as a speech</a> that Rubio supposedly would give to the Conservative Political Action Conference. In it, Rubio would acknowledge that he had said in a recent interview that \"I would have accepted the stimulus money.\"</p>\r\n<p>The news release was satire, but the point was serious -- that Rubio said he would have accepted stimulus money. We were  surprised by that because Rubio has been so critical of the stimulus, so  we decided to see what he had actually said.</p>\r\n<p>The Crist campaign  is referring to a Rubio interview by Keith Cate of WFLA-TV in Tampa on  Dec. 9, 2009. Asked whether \"he would not have accepted the stimulus  money,\" Rubio said that \"ultimately I would have accepted those portions  of the money that would not have put Florida in a worse position off in  the future than it is right now.\"<br /><br />That's not exactly a hearty  endorsement, but Rubio is definitely saying that he would take at least  some of the money.<br /><br />When the statement set off blog frenzy, the  Rubio campaign tried to explain. Alex Burgos, Rubio's spokesman, told <em> Politico </em>that \"There&rsquo;s a big different (sic) between what Charlie Crist  did by accepting the Obama stimulus as the best that Congress could do,  actively promoting it, advocating for it among his fellow Republicans  ... and what other governors ultimately did &mdash; governors like Rick Perry,  Bobby Jindal, Sarah Palin, Haley Barbor &mdash; by reluctantly accepting  federal funds after the fact.\" <br /><br />Rubio told <em>National Journal's&nbsp;  Hotline on Call </em>that \"advocating for the stimulus plan and accepting  those dollars are not the same. The stimulus was a disaster and I would  have fought it in every way possible.\"<br /><br />As far as we can tell,  Rubio has been consistent with his position that there is a distinction  between accepting money and actually endorsing the stimulus. Speaking  with The Weekly Standard in May 2009, Rubio said that \"It's one thing to  say you'll accept the funds from the federal government ... it's  another to actively advocate those policies, which I think are  disastrous for America.\"<br /><br />And indeed, even in the aforementioned  interview, when asked whether he would have attended the presidential  visit from Barack Obama -- referring to a February 2009 town hall  meeting in Fort Myers, which Crist attended -- Rubio said he would have  avoided it \"because that rally was in support of a specific plan.\"<br /><br />To  recap: Crist's campaign claimed that Rubio admitted that he would have  accepted the stimulus money. And indeed, in the WFLA interview, Rubio  said he \"would have accepted those portions of the money that would not  have put Florida in a worse position off in the future than it is right  now.\"<br /><br />We rate this Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-16T10:34:17.141528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-16T13:39:21", "ruling_headline": "Crist says Rubio has said he would have accepted stimulus money", "ruling_headline_slug": "crist-says-rubio-has-said-he-would-have-accepted-s", "ruling_link_text": "Pot, meet kettle", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Political Slugfest, <a href=\"http://www2.tbo.com/video/2009/dec/09/political-slugfest-88039/video-news/\" target=\"_blank\">Keith  Cate Interview with Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist</a>, Dec. 9, 2010. <br /><br />The  Weekly Standard, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/481shezi.asp?page=2&amp;pg=2\" target=\"_blank\">The  Florida Underdog</a>, by John McCormack, May 18, 2009.<br /><br />National  Journal Hotline on Call, <a href=\"http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2009/12/rubio_would_hav.php\" target=\"_blank\">Rubio  Would Have Taken Stimulus Money</a>, by Reid Wilson, Dec. 10, 2009.<br /><br />Politico,  <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/scorecard/1209/Rubio_backtracking_on_stimulus.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rubio  backtracking on stimulus?</a>, by Jessica Taylor, Dec. 10, 2009.<br /><br />Marco  Rubio Campaign Website, <a href=\"http://www.marcorubio.com/crist-stimulus-flashback-a-year-ago-crist-was-actually-working-to-help-president-pass-the-stimulus/\" target=\"_blank\">Crist  Stimulus Flashback</a>, Feb. 3, 2010.</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 15, "current_job": "", "false_count": 9, "first_name": "Charlie", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 257, "last_name": "Crist", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "charlie-crist", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/crist.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/257/", "total_count": 90, "true_count": 15, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Rubio admitted he \"would have accepted the stimulus money.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a news release", "statement_date": "2010-02-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 36, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Marco", "half_true_count": 33, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 277, "last_name": "Rubio", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "marco-rubio", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Marco_Rubio.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/277/", "total_count": 168, "true_count": 20, "website": "http://www.rubio.senate.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": null}
