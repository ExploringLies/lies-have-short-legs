Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed,&quot; Lady Gaga tweeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the fake account, just hours after the offending tweet, Gaga and Melania Trump met face-to-face, with Gaga hurling insults while the future first lady ignored the enraged pop star. That&rsquo;s when Gaga threw something at Trump, according to fake witnesses, forcing the Secret Service to intervene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The New York Post tried to reach out to the NYPD after it was reported that GooGoo was taken away in a black Yukon in handcuffs, but as of yet there&rsquo;s no record of an arrest,&quot; the item read. &quot;You can rest assured if this incident isn&rsquo;t prosecuted by the corrupt liberals in the city government that the less-than-lady will be staring down the barrel of a multi-million dollar lawsuit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The item surfaced Sep. 3 on <a href=\"http://americanflavor.news/2017/09/03/lady-gagas-twitter-attack-melania-trump-lands-handcuffs-two-meet-face-face/\">American Flavor</a>, which we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/?platform=hootsuite\">previously labeled</a> a fake news site.

But as one eagle-eyed writer at <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/lady-gagas-arrested-for-twitter-attack-on-melania-trump/\">Snopes</a> points out, it&rsquo;s actually a screengrab of actress Amanda Bynes being escorted into a courthouse in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2tGlgntXZ9_u7ERgEQKNhNaQlsNnn2YK8g7oqHvjfetsXI-Xp1IfHf6uO3dmCp-1HYl3zfQQaYP-9pIkJyy_WpbSisH1TPxdrd6ylsJNtLVyGEPozMMDtxv_Kcpy4OUQ-gky1Tmm\" style=\"border:none; height:351px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-06T14:46:40.594154", "ruling_date": "2017-09-06T15:20:44", "ruling_headline": "No, Lady Gaga was not arrested for criticizing Melania Trump.
