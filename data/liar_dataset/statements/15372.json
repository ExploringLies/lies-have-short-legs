So I wanted to let you know. And, by the way &mdash; I know you don&rsquo;t care about this &mdash; but that also includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s flat wrong. In fact, the last time that service members didn&rsquo;t receive an annual pay increase was in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that was only because of a one-time technical quirk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump was &quot;totally incorrect,&quot; said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;The military has gotten a pay raise each and every year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full historical rundown is available in Table 5-12 <a href=\"http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2019/FY19_Green_Book.pdf\">here</a>. We summarized those figures in this chart:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The increase of 2.4 percent in 2018 represented the biggest bump since 2010. But there have been increases every year since then, ranging from 1 percent to 2.1 percent. For 2019, the White House is proposing a 2.6 percent increase; the bill to enact that pay raise is working its way through Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how about that missing increase in 1983? That was the year Congress began starting pay raises on Jan. 1 of the new year, rather than the first day of the government&rsquo;s fiscal year in October. So service members received their pay at the start of the fiscal year a few months earlier, just not during the calendar year, Harrison said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond that, you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without a military pay increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that recent legislation &quot;includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s wrong. Depending how you count it, the most recent year without a military pay raise was either 35 or 57 years ago &mdash; not 10. And the most recent pay raise wasn&rsquo;t even the biggest in the past 10 years; it was exceeded by raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, during the Bush and Obama administrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-10T12:58:12.266838", "ruling_date": "2018-05-10T13:43:56", "ruling_headline": "Did Donald Trump sign the first military pay raise in 10 years?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-donald-trump-sign-first-military-pay-raise-10-", "ruling_link_text": "Pay raises have come like clockwork", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-celebration-military-mothers-spouses-event/\">remarks at a celebration of military mothers and spouses</a>, May 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Department, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Military_Comp-2011.pdf\">Compensation Elements and Related Manpower Cost Items Their Purposes and Legislative Backgrounds</a>,&quot; November 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Department, <a href=\"http://militarypay.defense.gov/Pay/Basic-Pay/AnnualPayRaise/\">annual pay adjustment data</a>, accessed May 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2019/FY19_Green_Book.pdf\">National Defense Budget Estimates for Fiscal Year 2019</a>,&quot; April 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, May 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steven Cheung, White House spokesman, May 10, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says the 2018 defense authorization bill includes raises for the military &quot;for the first time in 10 years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "remarks at the White House", "statement_date": "2018-05-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Did Donald Trump sign the first military pay raise in 10 years?"}
