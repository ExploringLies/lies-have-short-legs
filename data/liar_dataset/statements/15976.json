In September, city Police Chief Michael DeLeo <a href=\"https://www.boarddocs.com/fla/talgov/Board.nsf/goto?open&amp;id=B4ATE6762642\">shared data with the city commission</a> showing that during the first six months of 2018 overall crime was down 10.3 percent and violent crime was down 24 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One caveat about crime data: it is only as good as the reporting by the local police agencies. An <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/05/18/audit-tpd-crime-data-incorrectly-reported/580397002/\">audit </a>the police chief sought found that the city incorrectly reported crime statistics at a higher rate due to various errors in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeLeo told PolitiFact a small percentage of the drop between 2016 and 2017 is attributed to the overreporting found in the audit. However, he said that even when comparing the first half of 2016 and 2017 before the reports were audited there was a decrease in crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Other side of the crime picture</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than focus on the more favorable trend of reduced crime, the Republicans focus on hard, scary recent numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, the city had 17 murders, the highest ever. In the same year, Leon County&rsquo;s crime rate was the highest in the state &mdash; as it was in <a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/UCR/2014/cnty_annual14.aspx\">2014</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/UCR/2015/cnty_annual15.aspx\">2015</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/FSAC/UCR/2016/cnty_annual16.aspx\">2016</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Leon County is a broader area than just the city of Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Police Department handles the <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/05/22/crime-rate-down-but-leon-still-tops-state/631783002/\">bulk of the county&rsquo;s crime</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Limitations of crime rate data</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI cautions about the <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use\">pitfalls of using crime statistics to rank communities</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such rankings ignore local characteristics that influence crime, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. The <a href=\"https://www.asc41.com/policies/policyPositions.html\">American Society of Criminology </a>reached a similar conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tallahassee is a college town, home to Florida State University and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and also the state government. Accordingly, the city has a large number of visitors who do not live year-round in the city, including students, lobbyists, politicians and other people who work at the Capitol but may live in other cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means that crimes committed against &mdash; or by &mdash; students or commuters who work in the capital city are included in the count of Tallahassee&rsquo;s crimes, but many of them are not counted in the residential population of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This causes the per-person crime rate to be artificially inflated,&quot; said Brian Stults, an associate criminology professor at Florida State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A city mayor has relatively little control over the characteristics most often identified as the strongest predictors of local crime rates, such as poverty and the age of residents, Stults said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mayor may have some control over the size of the police department, but studies are inconsistent about whether increases in police size and funding lead to decreases in crime, Stults said. The more important factor is not how many police you have, but how they police.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The police department has increased its emphasis on community and problem-oriented policing over the past several years, which <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263519898_Is_Problem-Oriented_Policing_Effective_in_Reducing_Crime_and_Disorder_Findings_from_a_Campbell_Systematic_Review\">some</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272011608_Community-oriented_policing_to_reduce_crime_disorder_and_fear_and_increase_satisfaction_and_legitimacy_among_citizens_a_systematic_review\">studies</a> have linked to reductions in crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A city spokeswoman said Tallahassee has hired a few dozen more police officers during Gillum&rsquo;s tenure as mayor, growing the force by about 11 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayors, and police chiefs, can influence the strategies the police department uses, but the results that flow from these strategies take time, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a police officer in Bartow, Fla., in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tallahassee Democrat has written about various efforts by city and county officials to tackle crime in recent years, including targeting violent crime hotspots, monitoring crime trends, and developing a program for young people who are not in school or work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts caution against giving politicians <a href=\"https://andrewgillum.com/issue/criminal-justice-reform/\">credit</a> or blame for declines or increases in crime, which are more likely a function of social changes in the community or economy than political actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum said, &quot;I&#39;m the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crime rate in Tallahassee was 5,764.5 per 100,000 people in 2017 &mdash; the last time it was lower was in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Gillum points to the good news about the crime rate drop, Leon County still tops the state in the crime rate.
