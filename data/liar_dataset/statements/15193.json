We have the nation&rsquo;s highest homelessness rate and the nation&rsquo;s highest homeless population.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state has wrestled with this topic for decades, but has homelessness really &quot;skyrocketed&quot;? And how does its per capita and overall homeless population compare with other states?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found answers&nbsp;in a December 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2017-AHAR-Part-1.pdf\">The 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It includes a state-by-state comparison of homeless populations based on a one-night count in each state in January 2017. The report tallies per capita homeless rates and total homeless populations along with comprehensive sets of demographic data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharon Rapport, associate director for California policy at the Corporation for Supportive Housing, described the report as &quot;the most authoritative&quot; resource on the topic. CSH is a national organization that develops housing policy and makes housing loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She noted the HUD report is a snapshot of how many people are homeless at any given time. Her organization estimates the number of people who are homeless for at least part of a year is two to three times higher than any point-in-time tally.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Has homelessness &lsquo;skyrocketed&rsquo; in California?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The report shows California&rsquo;s homeless population jumped nearly 14 percent from 2016 to 2017 &mdash; to a total of more than 134,00 people. It rose nearly 9 percent over the previous seven years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s much different than the national picture. While the national homeless population ticked up about 1 percent in 2017, it remained 13 percent lower than in 2010, according to an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/06/568605069/homeless-population-rises-driven-by-west-coast-affordable-housing-crisis\">NPR analysis</a> following the report&rsquo;s release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably, the rise statewide and nationally in 2017 was <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/47662ad74baf4bb09f40619e4fd25a94\">attributed </a>to a surge in the number of people living on the streets in Los Angeles and other West Coast cities, at least in part due to a shortage of affordable housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the nation&rsquo;s relatively small increase, Allen is on track when he says California&rsquo;s homeless population has &quot;skyrocketed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How would Allen tackle the problem?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We need more state run mental institutions,&quot; the lawmaker said at the forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The institutions would offer the homeless substance abuse and psychiatric services, he said, &quot;so they can get back on their feet and re-enter the workforce.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/10241838/Eddie%20homeless%20Jan%202016%20AP%20photo.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2016 file photo Eddie, 51, a homeless man who would only give his first name and lives in a tent on the street in downtown Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Does California have the nation&rsquo;s highest homelessness rate?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On this point, Allen is slightly off target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the 2017 HUD report shows California&rsquo;s per capita homeless rate is high, it&rsquo;s not the highest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California has the third highest rate nationally with 34 in every 10,000 people in the state experiencing homelessness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two states are worse off: New York and Hawaii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York ranks second with 45 homeless people per 10,000. Hawaii, meanwhile, ranks first with 51 per 10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Does California have the highest homeless population in the nation?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Allen is again correct on this part of his statement. The HUD report lists California&rsquo;s total homeless population at 134,278. That&rsquo;s about one quarter of the national homeless population of 553,742.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York was a distant second with 89,503 followed by Florida with 32,190.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California does have the highest homeless population in the nation according to the (HUD report), but not the highest rate of homelessness. As a state, our per capita rate is amongst the highest, but it is not the highest,&quot; Rapport, of Corporation for Supportive Housing, summarized in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate for governor and state lawmaker Travis Allen recently claimed homelessness has &quot;skyrocketed&quot; in California and that the state has &quot;the nation&rsquo;s highest homelessness rate and the nation&rsquo;s highest homeless population.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A December 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is considered the authority on state-by-state homeless counts, and shows Allen got two of his three points correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s homeless numbers jumped nearly 14 percent in 2017 as nationwide levels remained nearly flat, giving credence to his first point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the report showed two other states, Hawaii and New York, have a higher per capita homeless rate than California&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it shows California, indeed, has the highest total homeless population at 134,278, far more than second place New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at Allen&rsquo;s statement in sum, he was on the mark twice and only slightly strayed from the facts on the per capita claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that reason, we rate his overall statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>UPDATE: After publication, we received an email from a&nbsp;spokeswoman for Travis Allen.
