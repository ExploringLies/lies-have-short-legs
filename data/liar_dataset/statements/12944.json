But even as she makes her potentially historic run, the number of women in Congress remains far from parity with men, said Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In Congress right now, we&#39;re doing the best job we have ever done in women in the Federal legislature, 19 percent,&quot; said Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia. &quot;That&#39;s the best job we&#39;ve ever done. Hold on for this, folks: Nineteen percent ranks the United States 75th in the world, below the global average. Iraq is 26 percent. Afghanistan, 28 percent. Number one? Rwanda, 64 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Kaine is correct that &quot;in Congress right now, we&#39;re doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,&quot; but it&rsquo;s still only &quot;19 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at the 19 percent number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS?year_high_desc=true\">World Bank</a>, which cites data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the 19 percent figure is right on for 2015.&nbsp;The U.S. figure has remained at 19 percent in the most recent <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif010616.htm\">Inter-Parliamentary Union data</a>, which is current through June 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, in&nbsp;2016, there are&nbsp;104 women serving in both chambers of&nbsp;Congress, comprising 19.4 percent&nbsp;of the 535 combined&nbsp;members. (In all,&nbsp;76 are Democrats and&nbsp;28 are Republicans.) &nbsp;Chamber by chamber,&nbsp;20 women serve in the Senate, accounting for&nbsp;20 percent of all members in the chamber,&nbsp;and 84 women serve in the House, accounting for 19.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is 19 percent the highest in United States history?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, Kaine is correct on that point, too, as the following chart from the <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43244.pdf\">Congressional Research Service</a> shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CMEQYzjIvDg-89tmvOYQl4WfKeL7TqBrB-NdtG-rOmxE93YZdww7UKmnnCmYZAhIaX9WgSY6G6srMOWpNpXQKvdqlszcwnd0aW5eIsY5EWGgBgAaXdeK_TALFPaC_0487Qc5Cuip\" style=\"border:none; height:436px; width:606px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s pretty straightforward,&quot; said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University&rsquo;s Eagleton Institute of Politics. &quot;It&#39;s a record high, but it&#39;s quite low.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If anything, Kaine underplayed the United States&rsquo; deficit compared to the rest of the world. The U.S. rank has bounced around a bit over the past year, but it places 96th in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union rankings, among 191 countries for which there is data. That&rsquo;s even worse than the 75th-place finish Kaine cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By comparison, the other countries Kaine mentioned did better, though hardly close to male-female parity. Iraq had 27 percent female legislators (58th in the most recent rankings), Afghanistan had 29 percent (ranking 50th) and Rwanda was indeed No. 1 in the world with 64 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine said, &quot;In Congress right now, we&#39;re doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,&quot; but it&rsquo;s still only &quot;19 percent.&quot; He&rsquo;s right that the current figure for the United States is 19 percent, and he&rsquo;s right that that&rsquo;s a record high. We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/669619cb-b381-46e4-8b4c-7e05ba0556f8\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/669619cb-b381-46e4-8b4c-7e05ba0556f8</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-22T16:31:17.972387", "ruling_date": "2016-08-22T18:14:10", "ruling_headline": "Tim Kaine correct about how poorly U.S. fares in percentage of women lawmakers", "ruling_headline_slug": "tim-kaine-correct-about-how-poorly-us-fares-percen", "ruling_link_text": "U.S. lags greatly in this measure", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Tim Kaine, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4942265?3\">comments in Fayetteville, N.C.</a>, Aug. 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Bank, <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS?year_high_desc=true\">Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments</a>, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union, <a href=\"http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif010616.htm\">percentage of women in legislatures</a>, June 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43244.pdf\">Women in Congress: Historical Overview, Tables, and Discussion</a>,&quot; April 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with&nbsp;Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University&rsquo;s Eagleton Institute of Politics, Aug. 22, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Tim", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 424, "last_name": "Kaine", "mostly_true_count": 15, "name_slug": "tim-kaine", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_NCCB111_CAMPAIGN_2016_KA.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/424/", "total_count": 57, "true_count": 12, "website": "http://www.kaine.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In Congress right now, we&#39;re doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,&quot; but it&rsquo;s still only &quot;19 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign event", "statement_date": "2016-08-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 146, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/146/", "subject": "Women", "subject_slug": "women", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "U.S. fares poorly in percentage of lawmakers who are women"}
