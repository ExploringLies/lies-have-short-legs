They cannot,&quot; Gingrich said. &quot;And yet Hillary wants to increase the number by 500 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has been called out on this before &mdash; by Republican presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-let-500-pe/\">Donald Trump</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basis for the claim stems from a Sept. 20, 2015, interview with Clinton on CBS&#39; Face the Nation.<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-u-s-should-take-65000-syrian-refugees/\"> Host John Dickerson asked</a> Clinton if President Barack Obama&rsquo;s plan to<a href=\"https://blogs.state.gov/stories/2015/09/20/secretary-kerry-announces-us-will-increase-refugee-resettlement-numbers\"> increase the number of Syrians allowed</a> in the country to 10,000 was enough. (The United States had accepted about 2,000 <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/nov/19/politifact-sheet-5-questions-about-syrian-refugees/\">by 2015</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said she<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-u-s-should-take-65000-syrian-refugees/\"> would like to see even more</a> refugees allowed into the country &mdash; suggesting as much as a 550 percent increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look, we&rsquo;re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more,&quot; Clinton said, &quot;and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a speech in December <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2015/12/15/comprehensive-plan-to-bolster-homeland-security/\">2015</a>, Clinton said, &quot;It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also said there had to be<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2015/12/15/comprehensive-plan-to-bolster-homeland-security/\"> vigilant screening and vetting</a> of refugees from Syria and that such process historically takes up to two years. The estimated wait <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-it-takes-almost-year-refugee-be-processed/\">checks out.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gingrich says the government cannot adequately screen Syrian refugees.

However, Gingrich failed to acknowledge the lengthy process before any refugee is admitted into the United States that includes in-person interviews, health screenings and referrals by nongovernmental agencies.
