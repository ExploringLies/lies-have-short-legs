Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is requesting information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the United States Postal Services and the U.S. Department of States regarding a drug she claims is illegally making its way into the country.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In a press release from Nov. 22, 2017, the senator said, &quot;Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid, and we should use every tool at our disposal to keep it from entering the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The number of opioid overdose deaths has been getting a lot of attention in recent years, but is fentanyl now the leading cause?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>What is fentanyl?</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fentanyl is a synthetic, or man-made, opioid sold legally as a pharmaceutical drug to treat pain. It is also illegally made and is increasingly used to intensify the effects (or &quot;high&quot;) of other drugs, such as heroin. Most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdose and death have been linked to illicitly-manufactured fentanyl. Heroin is an opioid synthesized from morphine that can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance. Heroin is an illegal, highly-addictive opioid, typically injected but also smoked and snorted.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Although fentanyl is similar to heroin, fentanyl is 30 to 50 times more potent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have overdose deaths increased?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a 21 percent increase nationally in overall overdose deaths from 2016 to 2017.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The CDC categorizes six types of drugs, with fentanyl part of the &quot;synthetic opioids excluding methadone.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Fentanyl-related deaths are on the rise.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6643e1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">A 2016 study</a>&nbsp;of 10 states over six months detected fentanyl in 56.3 percent of 5,152 synthetic opioid deaths.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The CDC reported a total of 20,145 overdose deaths, up from 9,445 in 2015, which means the number of overdoses related to synthetic opioids excluding methadone more than doubled between 2016 and 2017.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Sarah Feldman, the deputy communication director for McCaskill, told us that &quot;the term &lsquo;synthetic opioids excluding methadone&rsquo; is, according to the CDC, exclusively represented by &lsquo;fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard said the synthetic opioids category isn&rsquo;t exclusive to fentanyl. She gave an example as prescription pain reliever tramadol, which isn&rsquo;t fentanyl-based.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In other words, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are a subset of synthetic opioids. &quot;Fentanyl deaths cannot be separated out,&quot; Lenard said.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Sen. McCaskill said, &quot;Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The CDC says illegally manufactured fentanyl is primarily responsible for the increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids in 10 states. But fentanyl and fentanyl analogs aren&rsquo;t the only synthetic opioids claiming lives. There is no breakdown of fentanyl from the larger synthetic category number.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We rate this claim&nbsp;Half True.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-22T18:00:52.062545", "ruling_date": "2017-12-22T18:04:35", "ruling_headline": "McCaskill overreaches on fentanyl figures", "ruling_headline_slug": "mccaskill-overreaches-fentanyl-figures", "ruling_link_text": "Data doesn't quite say that", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Press release, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/media-center/news-releases/mccaskill-seeks-details-on-preventing-fentanyl-and-illicit-opioid-shipments-to-the-us\" target=\"_blank\">McCaskill Seeks Details on Preventing Fentanyl and Illicit Opioid Shipments to the U.S.</a>,&quot; November 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/health_policy/monthly-drug-overdose-death-estimates.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, as of 8/6/2017,</a>&quot; Dec. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6634a2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Trends in Deaths Involving Heroin and Synthetic Opioids Excluding Methadone, and Law Enforcement Drug Product Reports, by Census Region &mdash; United States, 2006&ndash;2015,</a>&quot; September 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Preventions and Control, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/fentanyl.html\" target=\"_blank\">Synthetic Opioid Data</a>,&quot; Dec. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Preventions and Control, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6643e1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Deaths Involving Fentanyl, Fentanyl Analogs, and U-47700 &mdash; 10 States, July&ndash;December 2016,</a>&quot; Nov. 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/02/upshot/fentanyl-drug-overdose-deaths.html\" target=\"_blank\">The First Count of Fentanyl Deaths in 2016:Up 540% in Three Years,</a>&quot; Sept. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/fentanyl\" target=\"_blank\">Fentanyl</a>,&quot; June 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sarah Feldman, Dec. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Courtney Lenard, Dec. 11, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Claire", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Missouri", "id": 258, "last_name": "McCaskill", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "claire-mccaskill", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/McCaskill_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/258/", "total_count": 20, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://mccaskill.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press release", "statement_date": "2017-11-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 161, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/161/", "subject": "Drugs", "subject_slug": "drugs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
