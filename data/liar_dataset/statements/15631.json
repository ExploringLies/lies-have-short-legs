We found no credible evidence to back up the headline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your News Wire largely drew from a story by <a href=\"https://truepundit.com/fbi-lisa-page-dimes-out-top-fbi-officials-during-classified-house-testimony-bureau-bosses-covered-up-evidence-china-hacked-hillarys-top-secret-emails/\">The True Pundit</a> about Page&rsquo;s closed-door House hearings on July 13 and July 16. The True Pundit said the information came from &quot;federal sources&quot; and &quot;well-placed FBI sources.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The True Pundit said that Page alleged that the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed &quot;assets&quot; had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s 30,000 &quot;missing&quot; emails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/11/donald-trump/did-john-podesta-deny-cia-and-fbi-access-dnc-serve/\">U.S. intelligence community</a> concluded that the Russian government directed the recent theft of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite that, Trump has questioned whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. In 2016, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/15/donald-trump/pants-fire-trump-tweet-about-russian-hacking-probe/\">Trump said</a> it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone &quot;sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Page, a former FBI lawyer, has drawn attention from lawmakers because she and former FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2018/feb/12/matt-gaetz/fbi-not-actively-investigating-clinton-emails/\">anti-Trump text messages</a> while having an affair. Both worked on the FBI&#39;s Russia investigation and for a brief time on Special Counsel Robert&rsquo;s Mueller&rsquo;s investigation. Strozak testified publicly for 10 hours on July 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have access to Page&rsquo;s testimony because it occurred in a closed-door session. News reports said Page didn&rsquo;t answer reporters&rsquo; questions before or after her testimony and lawmakers revealed little.

Page denied bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several right-wing websites have repeated the claim that Page contradicted the U.S. intelligence community and pointed the finger at China. We sent an email to Your News Wire and did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact evaluates information using on-the-record sources and information as of the time that a person or website makes a claim.
