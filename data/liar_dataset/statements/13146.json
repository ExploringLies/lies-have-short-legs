However, he has praised a proposal that would make those cuts, saying he is most influenced on Social Security by the proposal&rsquo;s author.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sept. 12, 2016, it was Gallagher&rsquo;s turn. He released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHzi81fFXa4\">TV ad</a> accusing Nelson of having &quot;backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this one rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2005 votes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallagher points to a vote that Nelson, then a member of the Wisconsin Assembly, took on the 2005-&rsquo;07 state budget -- a <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2005/related/acts/25.pdf\">394-page document</a> with thousands of figures and provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One provision in the budget, which was adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, eliminated state income taxes on Social Security benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, despite Gallagher&rsquo;s claim, there was not a proposal for higher taxes on Social Security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But eliminating the tax did save Wisconsin Social Security recipients an estimated <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/budget/2005_07_biennial_budget/400_state_tax_and_fee_modifications_included_in_20015_act_25_july_12_2006.pdf\">$99.7 million per year</a>, roughly what Gallagher claimed, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson voted against the budget. But does that mean he voted against the Social Security provision it contained?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When voting on something as huge as a state budget, a lawmaker could vote no for any number of reasons having to do with spending, policies or other factors. In other words, a no vote on the overall budget doesn&rsquo;t mean a lawmaker opposed every single provision, or even any particular provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson <a href=\"http://www.waupacanow.com/2016/09/21/social-security-focus-of-race/\">has said</a> <a href=\"https://nelsonforwisconsin.com/news/release-attack-ad-mike-gallagher-distorts-facts\">he voted</a> no because the budget reduced funding for education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The budget didn&rsquo;t actually reduce funding for public schools. It added $458 million over the two-year period. But the amount was less than half of the $938 million increase advocated by Doyle, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s one more point -- a significant one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson voted for an amendment that added the repeal of the tax on Social Security benefits to the budget. &nbsp;So, he was for the repeal, even though he voted against the overall state budget that ultimately accomplished the repeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallagher&rsquo;s campaign called it a &quot;show&quot; vote. &nbsp;But unlike the budget, it was an up-or-down vote on a single provision and, as such, gives a clearer idea of his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallagher says Nelson &quot;backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson voted against the 2005-&rsquo;07 state budget, which ended the state income tax on Social Security benefits, saving seniors more than $95 million per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not the same as backing higher taxes on Social Security, something that was not even on the table. And a vote against the overall state budget doesn&rsquo;t mean Nelson opposed eliminating the tax on Social Security benefits. Indeed, he voted for the amendment that added that provision to the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Gallagher&rsquo;s statement False.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/35810e3c-d936-4666-b6dc-4fb66acd6d61\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/35810e3c-d936-4666-b6dc-4fb66acd6d61</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-27T19:15:43.258213", "ruling_date": "2016-09-30T10:15:00", "ruling_headline": "In House race, Mike Gallagher's false claim about Tom Nelson and taxing Social Security benefits", "ruling_headline_slug": "house-race-mike-gallaghers-false-claim-about-tom-n", "ruling_link_text": "Misleading spin on state budget vote", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHzi81fFXa4\">Mike Gallagher &quot;Called out&quot;
