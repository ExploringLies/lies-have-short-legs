Typically that involves assistance with math, but sometimes with English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under a 2015 state law, high schools have to provide that information to the state Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz correctly says in his post that 175 schools were identified in the 2015 version of the report. That&rsquo;s 34% of the 510 public high schools in the state -- apparently the &quot;roughly a third&quot; he spoke of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are private schools in that 175, however, so the proper denominator (using both public and private schools) is 575. That means 30 percent of schools made the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Holtz is slightly off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More significantly, there&rsquo;s a false precision problem that hurts his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, it&rsquo;s impossible for the public to see exactly how many schools had students who needed help. That&rsquo;s because, as Holtz noted, only schools where 7 or more students need such help must be publicly identified by the university system. It&rsquo;s a privacy measure meant to protect the identify of individual students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s very likely more schools would be on the list if the privacy provision did not exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making the grade</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is making the list proof that these schools are &quot;missing the mark&quot; and not worthy of a passing grade on graduating &quot;college-ready&quot; students, as Holtz says?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz argues it is, citing Evers&rsquo; &quot;Every Child a Graduate, College and Career Ready&quot; mission statement. Even if just a few students need extra help, Holtz categorizes that as a failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom McCarthy, a spokesman at the Evers-led Department of Public Instruction, says the slogan means the goal is college or a career for each student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the phrasing, it&rsquo;s easy to see how one might interpret it as college for &quot;every child,&quot; so Holtz&rsquo;s &nbsp;rhetoric doesn&rsquo;t strike us as out of bounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, though, there is a major problem in characterizing the list. The report doesn&rsquo;t rank the schools or characterize their outcomes as passing or failing -- yet Holtz lumps all the schools on the list into one failing category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list includes every school that had at least 7 students who needed help, regardless of the size of the senior class and no consideration of how many -- or few -- of its graduates are in the state university system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the list includes many schools where you can count on two hands the number of students who needed remedial assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Brookfield East had 10 students who needed math help, landing it on Holt&rsquo;s failure list, despite the fact the number represents just 7.7 percent&nbsp;of the school&rsquo;s 130 UW-bound pupils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, the list includes a few schools where the rate is over 70 percent. (On average, it was 40 percent&nbsp;for math across all the listed schools).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the schools with higher rates have very few students going to the UW system. For example, Johnson Creek High School was listed as 80 percent&nbsp;needing math help -- or 8 of 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is ready?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor in checking Holtz&rsquo;s claim is how to define &quot;college ready.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz says the need for remedial help is enough to show the students were not ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the students already were accepted into college. The need for any remedial help is established in placement tests after their acceptance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a third of Wisconsin&rsquo;s high schools &quot;are missing the mark of graduating young adults who are college ready,&quot; Lowell Holtz claimed, a &quot;pass rate of 66.6 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz cites legitimate data and makes fair use of Evers&rsquo; own words to judge the incumbent&rsquo;s record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the limits of the data, and Holtz&rsquo;s blanket characterization of 175 schools as failing on preparing students for college, create significant misperceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts, our rating is Mostly False.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-30T11:59:51.636541", "ruling_date": "2017-03-30T14:14:15", "ruling_headline": "Candidate says Wisconsin deserved a D+ grade on preparing students for college", "ruling_headline_slug": "candidate-says-wisconsin-deserved-d-grade-preparin", "ruling_link_text": "Claim doesn't make the grade", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Lowell Holtz campaign <a href=\"http://www.kidservative.org/q-is-for-quality/\">blog post</a>, March 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Charles Sanger, president, CS Communications, spokesman for Holtz campaign, March 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Thomas McCarthy, communications director, Department of Public Instruction, March 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Wisconsin System, <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0923jaglerreport.pdf\">(WI Act 28) Report on Remedial Education</a>, Immediate New Freshmen from Wisconsin High Schools, Fall 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Candidate for State Superintendent of Schools", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Lowell", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 3837, "last_name": "Holtz", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "lowell-holtz", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT__Holtz.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3837/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.kidservative.org/"}, "statement": "<p>About a third of Wisconsin&rsquo;s high schools &quot;are missing the mark of graduating young adults who are college ready,&quot; a &quot;pass rate of 66.6%.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a post on a campaign web site", "statement_date": "2017-03-26", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Tony", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 2350, "last_name": "Evers", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "tony-evers", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 14, "party": "State official", "party_slug": "state-official", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/14/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Tony_Evers__PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2350/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": "Testing claim on Wisconsin high school grads needing remedial help in college."}
