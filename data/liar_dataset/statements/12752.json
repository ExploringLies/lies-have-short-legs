Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That&rsquo;s 16 years ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll focus on the final part of that statement -- that household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the numbers, Trump is right. Once you adjust for inflation, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N\">median household income</a> fell from $57,724 in 2000 to $53,657 in 2014, the last full year for which data is available. That&rsquo;s a decline of $4,067 -- in line with what Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This chart shows the trend since 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BXdMxYQL2GkWP0aSDDYnL-voBXm_I8328E_hN_Sj8y49TGhk7W4EvTJc_oQwf12d6CZAJ5e4gdiR7UCGPiE9MVwtC8b6pT1jwelnVweDtpd0uN8WvXInr-D6SDNQVgt_P3zS36U\" style=\"border:none; height:276px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting one bit of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this statistic came amid a series of shots at President Barack Obama, the majority of the period Trump was referring to came under the presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first eight years of the span Trump referred to -- 2000 to 2008 -- Bush was president. And during Bush&rsquo;s tenure, inflation-adjusted median household income declined by $2,411, which is more than half the total amount it fell between 2000 and 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Obama took office, it has fallen by $1,656. That&rsquo;s not a great legacy, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering that slicing the numbers this way puts all of the Great Recession on Obama&rsquo;s watch while also denying Obama 2015, when there was a slow but steady recovery, because data is not available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right on the number. However, for a statistic embedded in a series of attacks on Obama, it exaggerates the income trend under the current president. A majority of the decline in real household income since 2000 actually occurred under a Republican president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd9bd01f-4542-406b-b87e-313c218b1da3\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd9bd01f-4542-406b-b87e-313c218b1da3</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-21T23:18:50.463335", "ruling_date": "2016-07-21T23:47:53", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump is largely right that household incomes are down $4,000 since 2000", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-largely-right-household-incomes-are-d", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, though bulk of losses came under Bush, not Obama", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, &quot;<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N\">Real Median Household Income in the United States</a>,&quot; accessed July 21, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "his acceptance speech at the Republican Natiional Convention in Cleveland", "statement_date": "2016-07-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Trump largely right that incomes fallen\u00a0$4,000 since 2000"}
