Accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All-star numbers, if true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $800 million rebuilding of the Marquette, in the heart of downtown Milwaukee, was a huge traffic story from 2004 until the work was completed in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, Milwaukee has moved on to other mega-highway renovation projects, including the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange and the re-decking of the Hoan Bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statewide, a glut of highway projects has led to concern that Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s budget seeks too much borrowing for roadbuilding. The Legislature is reviewing options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Marquette, the old cloverleaf was having trouble handling increasing traffic. &nbsp;Motorists had to crisscross lanes to reach exits. Key components were falling apart and accidents were topping 600 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reconstruction didn&rsquo;t solve all the design puzzles in the busy interchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes were needed in 2010 to slow traffic on the long curve tying I-94 eastbound to I-43 northbound after the Milwaukee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and others raised concerns about accident rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, DOT had to make adjustments after backups and long delays plagued westbound I-794 in the Marquette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the overall claim?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the reconstruction add up to the big safety improvements claimed by the <a href=\"http://www.wtba.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association</u></a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the numbers show</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pat Goss and Kevin Traas from the group pointed us to the state Department of Transportation, which collects data on reported accidents from local law enforcement agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The association cited a <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/seregion/94stadiumint/docs/marqcrashdata.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>DOT chart</u></a> comparing the average number of crashes annually in the three years before the rebuild (2001-2003) to the first three years after (2009-2011).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It showed annual crashes down 48.2 percent, and injury or fatal crashes down 60 &nbsp;percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the numbers, that&rsquo;s 365 fewer reported accidents every year, and 143 fewer per year involving injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So those figures generally back up the group&rsquo;s claim, albeit by rounding up from 48 percent to 50 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Newer figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers are out of date though, so we obtained <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/DOT+5-year.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>five years of accident data</u></a> from before and after the construction period. Those figures run through 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a caveat: The boundaries used for the interchange were somewhat different in DOT&rsquo;s five-year comparison than in the three-year comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they help confirm the trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also show a big drop in total accidents, though not quite as sharp: 45 percent for total accidents, and 55 percent for injury accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cumulative accident count from 1999-2003: 3,416.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same count from 2009-2013: 1,890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For injury accidents in the five-year comparison, there were 561 fewer in the five years after the rebuilding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Pyritz, DOT spokesman for the southeast region, attributed the improvement in accident rates to several factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new interchange made exiting safer and improved sight lines while incorporating modern safety and efficiency designs, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We expect to see the same trend when the Zoo Interchange is done,&quot; Pyritz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a double check on the DOT data, we got crash figures from the Milwaukee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, which responds to most accidents in the Marquette Interchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That data showed somewhat smaller, but still significant, declines in accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, comparing the three years before the project (2001-2003) vs. the latest three years (2012-2014), accidents are down 45 percent and injury accidents 49 percent, according to the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. The two agencies defined the interchange somewhat differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By another measure -- the three years before rebuilding vs. the first three years after (2009-2011) -- the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office found 27 percent and 32 percent drops in total accidents and injury crashes, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That same comparison using the DOT data yielded the 48 percent and 60 percent drops. There&rsquo;s a large discrepancy in which the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office shows far fewer injury accidents before the project than are reported in the DOT figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s officials said a changeover in data collection methods, and late reporting of injuries by crash victims, likely explains some of the discrepancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, even with that, both agencies show a clear drop in accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One final note: more traffic could also explain the higher numbers of accidents before the reconstruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But DOT data we reviewed on its website suggests that traffic volumes were not significantly higher, if higher at all, back then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the broad view, after 30 years of steady increases, miles traveled on state highways leveled off in 2000 and have not budged much. On I-94, which feeds the Marquette, a DOT <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/seregion/94stadiumint/docs/I-94_East-West_Corridor_DEIS_November_2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>study</u></a> reported a 5 percent increase eastbound from the Brewers ballpark from 1989 to 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that might suggest that volume in the Marquette after the rebuild is roughly the same or higher than it was before construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association radio ad contended that &quot;accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent&quot; since the redesign of the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are different ways to slice this, but the ad cites official state data that is backed up within a few percentage points by more recent figures, and is generally confirmed by local data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-15T16:58:18.173460", "ruling_date": "2015-05-24T21:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Accidents cut in half after Marquette Interchange work, roadbuilders say", "ruling_headline_slug": "accidents-cut-half-after-marquette-interchange-wor", "ruling_link_text": "Dramatic drop in reported crashes", "ruling_state": "Wisconsin", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/audio/WTBA-Marquette+Safety+Radio+30.mp3\">radio ad</a>, 2014-15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Michael Pyritz, spokesman, SE Region of DOT, May 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Pat Goss, executive director, Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, and Kevin Traas, WTBA director of transportation policy and finance, May 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with &nbsp;Kenneth Yunker, executive director, Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC), May 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Ash Anandanarayanan, director of transportation policy, 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, May 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research on accident reporting by Wisconsin DOT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marquette Interchange crash data, <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/seregion/94stadiumint/docs/marqcrashdata.pdf\">annual averages over a three year period</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marquette Interchange crash data, <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/DOT+5-year.pdf\">five year period</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 3186, "last_name": "Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "wisconsin-transportation-builders-association", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup___________________42.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3186/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.wtba.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent&quot; in the rebuilt Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio ad", "statement_date": "2015-05-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 173, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/173/", "subject": "Public Safety", "subject_slug": "public-safety", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
