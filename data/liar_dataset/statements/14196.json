Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, were unsuccessful. (Palin&rsquo;s post was previously debunked by other news outlets including the <em><a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2017/06/that-time-sarah-palin-used-a-photo-of-the-florida-house-as-a-paris-climate-deal-meme.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Miami Herald</a>,</em> a partner along with the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> in PolitiFact Florida, and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/07/sarah-palin-florida-republicans-paris-accord-facebook-239243\">Politico</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Real origin of the photo: Florida</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo is actually from the 2011 Florida legislative session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We interviewed four of the Republican politicians in the photo: state Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, and former House members Will Weatherford, a former speaker from Wesley Chapel; Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary, and Rachel Burgin of Riverview. We also interviewed a Democrat in the photo: Jeff Clemens, now a state senator of Lake Worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all of the legislators recalled the particulars of the photo, but all of them said that their cheers had nothing to do with the Paris climate accord -- which was signed years later -- or about climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plakon directed us to search the <a href=\"https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/PhotoAlbums/photoAlbum.aspx?MemberId=4419\">Florida House website </a>to show the real reason behind the cheering. The website showed that the photo was taken by House photographer Mark Foley. The cutline states: &quot;From the left, Speaker-designate Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, signaled that session was coming to a close as members celebrate on the House floor, May 7, 2011.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"FLHouseMay72011.PNG\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZwKb_uZhphtHsjSZ6gUouANkchHX2RkMfTDlW3W8hO0zjtyLb06l1Pj8C4vDTDUTo5dMC13TLbw4C-X0D2zMvC3JVIsQoOpNSq94F2mSfwKEzS-2hM0ZnuDFQ10bXSduHj2ad9b\" style=\"height:515px; width:511px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plakon recalled some late night (which led to early morning) back-and-forth maneuvering between the House and the Senate in the final hours of that session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was a famous night,&quot; Plakon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final hours of the 2011 legislative session on Saturday, May 7, were chaotic, according to a <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/florida-legislatures-meltdown-how-it-happened/1168416\"><em>Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times</em> timeline</a>. As the hours stretched on, lawmakers played songs such as &quot;A Hard Day&#39;s Night&quot; and &quot;Help&quot; by the Beatles and &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; on the public speaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 11:30 p.m. after the House unanimously rejected a Senate bill related to rules for the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the chamber erupted into cheers and shouts of, &quot;It&rsquo;s us versus the Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 1 a.m., senators went home. At 2 a.m., the House passed a bill that included tax cuts and adjourned as Handel&#39;s Hallelujah chorus played on the public address system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minutes later the senators had to return -- looking tired. One member came in wearing no shoes, another with no socks and a third in jeans and a T-shirt. The session finally ended at 3:35 a.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were unable to confirm by deadline with House officials exactly what time Foley&rsquo;s photo was taken during the conclusion of the session. But some of the members recalled the image from the conclusion of the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We were all clapping because it was finally finished,&quot; Burgin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She described the situation as &quot;humorous&quot; but said it was a bad choice for Palin to use a 2011 photo of the Florida House for a post about the 2015 climate accord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s kind of bad taste to label Florida legislators as being involved in that, especially in 2011,&quot; she said. &quot;Everybody and their brother has been tagging me since it published, it&rsquo;s kind of funny.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the legislators got a chuckle about the use of the photo in Palin&rsquo;s meme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plakon, a publisher of a <a href=\"https://www.claimspages.com/\">website</a> used by insurance claims professionals, quipped, &quot;As a publisher I object to the use of low-resolution graphics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Burgin said she has no opinion on the climate accord. Weatherford declined to express his opinion. Plakon called the accord a &quot;bad deal&quot; and sided with Trump&rsquo;s position. Dorworth, who lost an election in 2012, said he didn&rsquo;t support the Paris accord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most of the persons in that picture probably would not have supported the Paris climate accord either,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clemens, the Democrat, was the only lawmaker we interviewed who told us he supports the climate accord. &quot;Of course I support the world coming together to solve serious problems. Who wouldn&rsquo;t?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Palin posted a viral image that purportedly shows a group of people clapping as a result of the Paris agreement, presumably about the billions they will earn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except, it&rsquo;s not that at all. The photo is of Florida lawmakers elated at the long-awaited close of the 2011 legislative session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text and photo pairing is inaccurate.
