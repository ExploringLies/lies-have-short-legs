(Conservative Tribune did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s highly misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article cites a Dec. 1, 2016, <a href=\"https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/passing-1-trillion/\">blog post</a> titled, &quot;Passing $1 Trillion,&quot; by the American Action Forum, a group that <a href=\"https://www.americanactionforum.org/about/\">describes itself</a> as &quot;center-right&quot; and &quot;free-market.&quot; (Here&rsquo;s some <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2014/02/american-action-networkamerican-action-forum/\">background on the group</a> from our friends at FactCheck.org.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a free-market group, reducing the regulatory burden is a core principle. So for years, the group has been tallying the costs of federal regulations, basing its work on the federal government&rsquo;s own estimates of a regulation&rsquo;s impact on both direct and indirect costs, including higher consumer prices, lower wages, and costs related to paperwork and other overhead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late this year, the tally passed $1 trillion, which prompted the blog post in question. The $3,000 figure stems from the group&rsquo;s calculation of $1 trillion in costs being spread out among the entire population. &quot;On a per capita basis, there are 324 million people in the U.S., equating to a regulatory burden of $3,080 per person,&quot; wrote Sam Batkins, the group&rsquo;s director of regulatory policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the $3,000 figure is based on a nugget of truth. But the Conservative Tribune, and other websites that shared similar headlines, framed the finding in a way that is significantly misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are five problems in the description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The $3,000-a-person figure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, some of the $1 trillion figure that this is based on stems from regulations imposed before Obama took office. The $1 trillion figure &quot;tracked all net present value regulatory costs since 2005, so it includes the entire second half of the Bush administration,&quot; Batkins told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By our calculation, final rules under Obama alone accounted for $865 billion. That would produce a figure of $2,670 rather than $3,000. Not a dramatic difference, but one worth pointing out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the annual cost of Obama&rsquo;s regulations -- rather than the cumulative cost -- is a bit over $500 a person, according to the group&rsquo;s calculations. That&rsquo;s still substantial, but it&rsquo;s not the wallop that $3,000 would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The assertion that Obama did this &quot;right before leaving&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not the case. This regulatory cost burden has been accumulating in fits and starts since more than a decade ago in 2005. In fact, the figure also includes regulatory costs that either &quot;have been or will be imposed during the next few years,&quot; the blog post said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means that &quot;some of the costs might not be borne until the next decade,&quot; Batkins told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This would not hit &quot;every&quot; American, or all at once</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline phrase &quot;take $3,000 from every U.S. citizen&quot; makes it sound like people&#39;s taxes are going up $3,000 in one fell swoop. They are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, this amount would be drained over a long period of time and in myriad ways, with some people getting a bigger hit (by losing a job) and some a smaller hit (by having to pay a little more for products they buy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s correct to say that regulations don&rsquo;t act like taxes,&quot; Batkins said. &quot;Many of the cost estimates take the form of higher prices for some consumer products, cars, air conditioners, and furnaces.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This is an estimate, and it was calculated by a group with a perspective</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline does not make clear that these figures are estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Action Forum&rsquo;s own post notes, &quot;There is probably no one &lsquo;correct answer&rsquo; on the cumulative costs of regulation. These figures are just estimates (unadjusted for inflation) from federal regulators, some more than a decade old, which might have dubious value.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as we&rsquo;ve noted, the American Action Fund has a free-market orientation. Other groups with different perspectives may frame the statistics accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This calculation leaves out all benefits from these regulations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Action Forum mentions in its blog post that the government also calculates benefits that spring from these regulatory costs. &quot;There are also benefits associated with many, but not all, of the largest regulations,&quot; Batkins told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, the group&rsquo;s blog post says, &quot;AAF recorded $745 billion in annual benefits during the same period.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefits from regulations implemented under Obama include <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/inspection/siluriformes\">prevention of foodborne illnesses through inspection</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/34-63241.pdf\">consumer protection in the financial sector</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Regulations-Laws--Standards/Rulemaking/Final-and-Proposed-Rules/Flammability-of-Mattresses-and-Mattress-Pads\">flammability standards for consumer products</a>, <a href=\"https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/standards.aspx?productid=32\">reduced energy use from conservation standards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/03/2016-11971/oil-and-natural-gas-sector-emission-standards-for-new-reconstructed-and-modified-sources\">cleaner air from emissions standards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2006/05/26/06-4800/air-cargo-security-requirements\">air cargo security standards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bsee.gov/guidance-and-regulations/regulations/well-control-rule\">oil-well blowout preventer systems</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/tritium/safety-requirements.html\">nuclear reactor safety standards</a>, among many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, using both the cost and benefit figures, the net cost of regulations would work out to less than $800 a person -- still a net cost, but much smaller than the $3,000 figure cited in the headline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, for the headline to cite just the costs but not the benefits amounts to cherry picking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Conservative Tribune published a post titled, &quot;Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American,&quot; and other websites offered posts with similar headlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure is based on a calculation from an anti-regulatory group, though we do give the conclusion some credence because the number is drawn from the federal government&rsquo;s own estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the headline glosses over several important caveats. The costs were not solely imposed under Obama, and the ones that were on his watch occurred over an eight-year period, rather than just &quot;before leaving&quot; the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, contrary to the headline&rsquo;s implication, Americans will not be charged a $3,000 fee because of action taken in Obama&rsquo;s final weeks. Rather, they would experience higher consumer costs or lower wages over many years, with a lot of variation from person to person, and going many years into the future. The calculation completely ignores the estimated benefits of these regulations, with a value that balances out about three-quarters of the cost figure cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/85a69956-7bb7-4464-b30d-6d4e640eeab6\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/85a69956-7bb7-4464-b30d-6d4e640eeab6</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-14T12:19:12.488645", "ruling_date": "2016-12-14T14:53:30", "ruling_headline": "Website wrongly says Obama plans to take $3,000 from every American", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservative-website-exaggerates-misleads-post-reg", "ruling_link_text": "A lot of context left out", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Conservative Tribune, &quot;<a href=\"http://conservativetribune.com/leaving-obama-finds-way-3000/\">OUTRAGE: Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American</a>,&quot; Dec. 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Action Forum, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/passing-1-trillion/\">Passing $1 Trillion&quot; (blog post)</a>, Dec. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Action Forum, <a href=\"http://regrodeo.com/?year%5B0%5D=2016&amp;year%5B1%5D=2015&amp;year%5B2%5D=2014&amp;year%5B3%5D=2013&amp;year%5B4%5D=2012&amp;year%5B5%5D=2011&amp;year%5B6%5D=2010&amp;year%5B7%5D=2009&amp;year%5B8%5D=2008&amp;year%5B9%5D=2007&amp;year%5B10%5D=2006&amp;year%5B11%5D=2005&amp;topic%5B0%5D=tag_3\">&quot;Regulation Rodeo&quot; database</a>, accessed Dec. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sam Batkins, the group&rsquo;s director of regulatory policy, Dec. 13, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "conservative website", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Arizona", "id": 3776, "last_name": "Conservative Tribune", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "conservative-tribune", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Conservative_Tribune_logo.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3776/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://conservativetribune.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a web post", "statement_date": "2016-12-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 213, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/213/", "subject": "Government regulation", "subject_slug": "government-regulation", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": "Conservative website exaggerates, misleads in post on regulatory study"}
