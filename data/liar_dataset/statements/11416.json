Bernie Sanders from the left at the first Democratic debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; record on the issue has been the subject of much liberal ire. After CNN moderator Anderson Cooper grilled Sanders on his <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/1036\">vote</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/1036\">shielding firearms companies</a> from lawsuits, Clinton brought up another time Sanders didn&rsquo;t side with gun control advocates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The majority of our country supports background, and even the majority of gun owners do,&quot; Clinton said on Oct. 13. &quot;Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady Bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton is correct that most Americans (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/oct/05/jeremy-bird/jeremy-bird-says-90-percent-americans-want-mandato/\">90 percent</a>) support background checks. But did Sanders vote against the landmark Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which mandated a five-day waiting period for background checks for gun purchases?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Five nays from the Vermont congressman</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton campaign pointed to our July <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/\">fact-check</a> of an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O&rsquo;Malley super PAC. We rated a slightly more expansive claim &mdash; &quot;Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, background checks and waiting periods&quot; &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/\">Mostly True</a>. (That statement that referred specifically to background checks, which Sanders had supported.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermont&rsquo;s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. In May 1991, Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1991/roll083.xml\">against</a> a version that mandated a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/7\">seven-day waiting period</a> for background checks, but the bill passed in the House. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The Senate decreased the waiting period to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/1241\">five days</a> and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1991/roll443.xml\">against</a> that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn&rsquo;t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1025/text/rh\">reinstated the five-day waiting period</a>. In November 1993, Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll563.xml\">against</a> that version <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll564.xml\">twice</a> in the same day, but <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll559.xml\">for</a> an amendment imposing an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/103rd-congress/house-amendment/390\">instant background check</a> instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn&rsquo;t exist at the time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. He also voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll560.xml\">against</a> an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll561.xml\">for</a> an amendment giving those denied a gun <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/103rd-congress/house-amendment/389\">the right to know why</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- &nbsp;an <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1025\">interim five-day waiting period</a> while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll614.xml\">against</a> it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July, when we first looked into the issue, Sanders&rsquo; campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He wasn&#39;t opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,&quot; Weaver said. &quot;He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A mixed record overall</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Sanders is neither a gun nut nor an anti-gunner. He&rsquo;s received <a href=\"https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/27110/bernie-sanders/37#interpret\">lukewarm marks</a> from the NRA, ranging from a C- to F in the last 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Throughout his time in public office, Sen. Sanders has consistently voted to outlaw the most dangerous weapons and keep guns out of the hands of criminals,&quot; Sanders spokesperson Michael Briggs told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Briggs noted that Sanders has voted in favor of <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/4296/summary/00\">banning assault weapons</a>, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/106th-congress/house-amendment/216/actions\">closing the gun show loophole</a>, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/senate-amendment/714/text\">regulating high capacity magazines</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/senate-amendment/715\">expanding background checks</a> in the wake of the Newtown massacre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/senate-amendment/139\">Amtrak trains</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/111th-congress/senate-amendment/1067/text\">National Parks</a>, though his most recent <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/111th-congress/senate-amendment/3276\">pro-gun vote</a> was in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(Sanders&rsquo;) gun control position is a reflection of living in Vermont for 40 years,&quot; Garrison Nelson, a professor of professor of political science at the University of Vermont, told us in July. &quot;Vermonters use guns to shoot deer and moose, not one another.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Sen. Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders voted against the Brady bill five times from 1991 to 1993. Sanders&rsquo; campaign manager told us in July that he did so because he was against a national waiting period and had to answer to the people of Vermont, a rural state with high gun ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to guns. But he did indeed register five nays on the Brady bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Clinton&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-13T21:26:58.352868", "ruling_date": "2015-10-13T21:26:20", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton: Bernie Sanders voted against Brady bill five times", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-voted-against-brady", "ruling_link_text": "Five nays in two years", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Michael Briggs, spokesperson for Bernie Sanders, Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Nick Merrill, spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/\">Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases?</a>&quot; July 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress.Gov search, Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Sen.
