Organizers at Poynter.org&nbsp;describe the day as &quot;not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story cited an actual event &mdash; a Peach State lawmaker had introduced a bill in November 2016 in the Georgia General Assembly that <a href=\"http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/11/16/a-bill-to-restrict-the-wearing-of-muslim-burqa-and-veil-in-georgia/\">would have banned the wearing of burqas, niqabs and veils</a>. The story trumpeted the bill as being &quot;about keeping the American people safe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the post did not indicate that the legislation never became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Rep. Jason Spencer on Nov. 15 <a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20172018/HB/3\">filed HB 3</a> for the 2017 legislative session. The bill <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/18/after-outcry-georgia-lawmaker-abandons-bill-that-would-have-banned-muslims-from-wearing-veils/?utm_term=.7957bba03298\">aimed to expand the scope</a> of a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/muslim-backlash-georgia-lawmaker-change-no-mask-law/\">state law passed in 1951</a> that made <a href=\"http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-11/article-2/16-11-38\">wearing a mask a misdemeanor</a> (unless it was for celebrations, work, sports or emergencies). The original law aimed to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing their hoods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spencer&rsquo;s bill could have prevented Muslim women from wearing any kind of head covering while driving, or possibly even while on public property. It also prevented people from wearing veils in driver&rsquo;s licenses and government-issued IDs, a rule <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/muslim-backlash-georgia-lawmaker-change-no-mask-law/\">the state already had</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,&quot; Spencer <a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/new-bill-would-ban-women-from-wearing-burqas-for-drivers-license-photos/467901403\">told Atlanta&rsquo;s WSB-TV</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quote is cited in the USANewsPost.us article, which made an inference that if the bill passed, Georgia would have stopped &quot;Muslim culture&quot; in a way no other state had. (For the most part, the wearing of religious headcoverings is protected by the First Amendment.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the bill didn&rsquo;t pass the General Assembly, because Spencer withdrew the measure just two days later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created,&quot; he <a href=\"http://www.house-press.com/?p=6060\">said in a statement</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety. However, further consideration dictates that other solutions will need to be considered. In conclusion, anti-masking statutes have been upheld as constitutional (<em>State vs Miller</em>, 1990), and HB 3 would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Miller case to which Spencer refers involved a Klan member who <a href=\"http://law.justia.com/cases/georgia/supreme-court/1990/s90a1172-1.html\">challenged the Anti-Mask Act and lost</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USANewsPost.us cites <a href=\"http://dailyusaupdate.com/georgia-becomes-first-state-ban-muslim-culture-historic-move-restore-western-values/\">DailyUSAUpdate.com</a> as the source of the post, and that site in turn says the post came from <a href=\"http://openmagazines.com/georgia-becomes-first-state-ban-muslim-culture/\">OpenMagazines.com</a>.
