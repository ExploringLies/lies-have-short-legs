In the movie, Bullock played a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1018765/\">political consultant</a> drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a <a href=\"http://people.com/movies/sandra-bullocks-political-views-and-opinion-on-donald-trump/\">press conference in October 2015</a> for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t agree with that at all,&quot; Bullock said. &quot;That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don&rsquo;t agree with that statement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son.
