Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully.\"\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n Before we dig into Levin's claim that other Western countries have already repealed similar policies, some background: On the campaign trail, Obama wrote an open letter to the LGBT &mdash; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender &mdash; community, stating that, as president, he would \"bring about real change for all LGBT Americans.\" Chief among his efforts would be a repeal of the military's rule, one that was put into place during the Clinton administration.\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n That's easier said than done, however. Obama cannot simply undo \"don't ask, don't tell\" &mdash; it must be repealed by Congress. So, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in March 2009 that the administration was not actively pursuing a rule change, we gave Obama a\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/293/call-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Stalled\n </a>\n on our Obameter for his promise to overturn the policy.\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n The issue was back in the news Oct. 11 when Obama spoke at a gathering of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization. He told the group: \"I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy.\"\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n Levin hopes the policy will change. To underscore his optimism, he pointed out that the United States wouldn't be the first country to repeal laws banning gays from the military.\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n Australia ended its ban on homosexuals in the military in 1992, as did Canada.\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n Levin is also right that Britain does not prohibit gays and lesbians from serving. Its ban was lifted in 2000, when the European Court of Human Rights settled a two-year legal battle involving four homosexual service members.\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n All told, at least 25 Western countries have no ban on gays and lesbians in the military, according to the Palm Center, a public policy think tank associated with the University of California at Santa Barbara. As of June 2009, that list includes Germany, Austria, Spain, Finland and France.\n <br />\n &nbsp;\n <br />\n So, Levin is correct that other Western countries, including Britain, have ended policies that prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly. We give him a True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:50.281568", "ruling_date": "2009-10-12T13:47:45", "ruling_headline": "Levin claims that other Western countries have lifted their bans", "ruling_headline_slug": "levin-claims-other-western-countries-have-lifted-t", "ruling_link_text": "Levin's done his research", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n Meet the Press,\n <a href=\" http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33253216/ns/meet_the_press/page/3/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  transcript from Oct. 11, 2009, show\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n C-SPAN,\n <a href=\"http://cspan.org/Watch/Media/2009/10/10/HP/R/24123/Pres+Obama+addresses+gay+rights+group+on+ending+discrimination.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\n  President Barack Obama addressed the Human Rights Campaign\n </a>\n , Oct. 10, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n CBS News,\n <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/07/27/world/worldwatch/entry5190798.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">\n  In U.K. Military, Gay Pride Shine\n </a>\n s, by Daniel Carty, July 27, 2009\n <br />\n <br />\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/24/world/australia-ends-a-prohibition-on-homosexuals-in-military.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Australia Ends a Prohibition On Homosexuals in Military\n </a>\n , November 24, 1992\n</p>\n<p>\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/11/world/canada-ending-anti-gay-army-rules.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Canada Ending Anti-Gay Army Rules\n </a>\n , By Clyde H.
