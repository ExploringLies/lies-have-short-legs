I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s time to cut the perks and change business as usual.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat statement is presented as a direct quote from Abele. To underline the pledge, Abele&rsquo;s name is listed below it (albeit with his first name misspelled).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith the direct mail piece coming on top of the ad, it got us wondering about the perks, especially the snazzy cars. (A second piece echoes the first, but features a cell phone with the words &quot;They are dialing on your dime.&quot;)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust how many politicians are driving around in them?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Abele spokesman Brandon Lorenz which officials have their car on the chopping block.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The county executive has a car,&quot; said Lorenz. &quot;If elected, Chris will cut it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s referring to a 2006 Chevy Impala that&rsquo;s kept at the Courthouse Annex for use by the county executive. Latest records show it has about 23,000 miles on it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder former County Executive Scott Walker, now the governor, some 2,032 miles were put on it from June of 2009 to June of 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow much is it worth?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/\">Edmunds.com</a>, a car pricing service, pegs the trade-in value of that make and model at $9,400 -- assuming it&rsquo;s in good condition and has a better than average option package.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what about all the other cars? After all, the ad and fliers suggest there is plenty of money to be saved by cutting them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe located a Nov. 19, 2010 report to the County Board that lists all county passenger vehicles used by employees, other than those within the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAside from the county executive&rsquo;s car, the only other one for an elected official on the list is a 2003 Ford Crown Victoria assigned to the district attorney. The DA is allowed to keep the Crown Vic -- another model frequently used as a squad car -- at his home to respond to crime scenes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe list also includes a variety of delivery vans, SUVs and so forth, including about 10 vehicles that workers use to cart critters around at the zoo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo Lincoln Town Cars were listed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt Milwaukee City Hall, aldermen receive a monthly &quot;car allowance.&quot; But county supervisors (as well as judges, and most other elected county officials) receive no such perk.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s complete our visit to the motor pool.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele has promised to slash perks enjoyed by county politicians and bureaucrats. Outside of the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, two elected officials have county-funded cars; one, the top prosecutor, has his for emergency use and is not targeted by Abele.That narrows Abele&rsquo;s car-cutting target to one vehicle: a five year old Impala that&rsquo;s worth less than $10,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a drop in the billion dollar budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s a bit of truth here &hellip; Of the more than 75 county elected officials, at least two have access to a car that&rsquo;s paid for by taxpayers. But the argument Abele is making -- that he&rsquo;ll cut lavish perks to save hardworking taxpayers a bunch of money -- comes up flat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
