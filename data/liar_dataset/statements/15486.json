This is an unsubstantiated, ridiculous allegation by conspiracy theorists who have tried to link the Clintons to criminal activity for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives,&quot; said a June 10, 2018, <a href=\"https://yournewswire.com/anthony-bourdain-killed-clinton-operatives/\">headline</a> from YourNewsWire.com, a website with a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/yournewswirecom/\">history</a> of peddling falsehoods online. The report cited a similar <a href=\"http://newmediacentral.net/cnn-host-who-was-bullied-on-twitter-by-clinton-staffer-hangs-self/\">article</a> from News Media Central, an &quot;alternative media&quot; site that considers itself &quot;free from establishment influence,&quot; according to its about page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook&#39;s News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YourNewsWire.com&rsquo;s story said Bourdain, who died June 8, 2018, &quot;had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead&quot; and added that &quot;investigators&quot; were looking into the matter. As evidence of a link between Bourdain&rsquo;s death and the Clintons, the report pointed to two tweets from Bourdain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bourdain/status/918260116977307648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fyournewswire.com%2Fanthony-bourdain-killed-clinton-operatives%2F\">first tweet</a>, posted Oct. 11, 2017, criticized Hillary Clinton over an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2017/10/12/anthony-bourdain-calls-hillary-clintons-weinstein-response-shameful/?utm_term=.6f829d46dfd7\">interview</a> with CNN&rsquo;s Fareed Zakaria during which she said she was &quot;appalled&quot; to discover that there was &quot;a different side&quot; to her longtime donor Harvey Weinstein, a film producer who was accused by several women &mdash; including Bourdain&rsquo;s girlfriend, Asia Argento &mdash; of sexual assault. Bourdain called Clinton&rsquo;s response &quot;uninspiring,&quot; and many Clinton supporters responded on Twitter, including former Clinton spokesman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/918303955926634499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fyournewswire.com%2Fanthony-bourdain-killed-clinton-operatives%2F\">Brian Fallon</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bourdain/status/991823988765614081\">second tweet</a>, sent May 2, 2018, Bourdain said he was &quot;in no way (a Hillary Clinton) fan&quot; and that he had &quot;been on the receiving end of her operatives&rsquo; wrath&quot; before. The Twitter thread started when Bourdain shared a Rolling Store story about Donald Trump attorney Michael Cohen, writing, &quot;The glorious career of &lsquo;Fast&rsquo; Mikey Cohen. Nothing to see here, folks. Totally legit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The YourNewsWire.com report suggested that these tweets show the Clintons as likely responsible for Bourdain&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The YourNewsWire.com report, like other Clinton-related <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/23/patriot-report/fake-news-says-hitman-bill-clinton-confesses/\">conspiracies</a> before it, crumbles under the microscope. The story&rsquo;s only sources are alleged investigators &mdash; all unnamed &mdash; who were said to be looking into Bourdain&rsquo;s death and also whether he had been planning to air an expos&eacute; of a pedophile ring, a separate claim that Snopes already <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/anthony-bourdain-expose-elite-ring/\">debunked</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sean Adl-Tabatabai, editor-in chief at YourNewsWire.com and author of the false report, told us the investigators referenced were &quot;online sleuths who dug up Anthony&rsquo;s tweets and joined the dots.&quot; He also pointed again to Bourdain&rsquo;s May tweet as proof of the Clintons&rsquo; involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence that the Clintons played any role in Bourdain&rsquo;s death. Bourdain died by suicide and was found unresponsive in his hotel room by a close friend, CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/us/anthony-bourdain-obit/index.html\">reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-12T14:01:01.010962", "ruling_date": "2018-06-12T14:08:39", "ruling_headline": "Clickbait headline wrongly blames Clintons for Anthony Bourdain's death", "ruling_headline_slug": "clickbait-headline-wrongly-blames-clintons-anthony", "ruling_link_text": "A terrible allegation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YourNewsWire.com, <a href=\"https://yournewswire.com/anthony-bourdain-killed-clinton-operatives/\">&quot;Investigators: Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton Operatives,&quot;</a> June 20, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News Media Central, <a href=\"http://newmediacentral.net/cnn-host-who-was-bullied-on-twitter-by-clinton-staffer-hangs-self/\">&quot;CNN Host Who Was Bullied On Twitter By Clinton Staffer Hangs Self,&quot;</a> June 8, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bourdain/status/918260116977307648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fyournewswire.com%2Fanthony-bourdain-killed-clinton-operatives%2F\">Anthony Bourdain</a>, October 11, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bourdain/status/991823988765614081\">Anthony Bourdain</a>, May 2, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/us/anthony-bourdain-obit/index.html\">&quot;CNN&rsquo;s Anthony Bourdain dead at 61,&quot;</a> June 8, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2017/10/12/anthony-bourdain-calls-hillary-clintons-weinstein-response-shameful/?utm_term=.6f829d46dfd7\">&quot;Anthony Bourdain calls Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s Weinstein response &lsquo;shameful,&rsquo;&quot; </a>October 12, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/anthony-bourdain-expose-elite-ring/\">&quot;Was Anthony Bourdain About to Expose an Elite Pedophile Ring?&quot;</a> June 9, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sean Adl-Tabatabai, editor-in-chief at YourNewsWire.com, June 11, 2018.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4091, "last_name": "YourNewsWire.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "yournewswirecom", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4091/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://YourNewsWire.com"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-06-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
