Walker is denounced as favoring big corporations over families on taxes and opposing a minimum wage increase &quot;even though he increased his own pay by $50,000.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a claim that might raise both your eyebrows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn elected official raising his own pay, by himself? And by fifty large?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs readers of PolitiFact Wisconsin know, some of this is old ground. <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/06/scott-walker/gop-governor-candidate-scott-walker-says-he-has-gi/\">We ruled as </a><a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/06/scott-walker/gop-governor-candidate-scott-walker-says-he-has-gi/\">True</a> a claim by Walker that he had given back more than $370,000 of his salary to Milwaukee County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, where is Advancing Wisconsin headed with its claim?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst a little history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker was elected county executive in 2002 in the wake of a scandal over lavish county pensions. One of Walker&rsquo;s campaign pledges, which he kept, was that he would return $60,000 of his pay to the county every year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time, the county executive&rsquo;s salary was $132,724. In 2004, the County Board cut the salary to $129,114 in 2004. (It&rsquo;s important to note only the board, not the county executive, can change the salary.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs support, Advancing Wisconsin cites a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/29505169.html\">story from March 2008</a>. The article notes Walker said then if re-elected in April 2008, he would return $10,000 of his salary each year to the county.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker was re-elected and now gives back $10,000, rather than $60,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo Advancing Wisconsin, that&rsquo;s increasing his pay by $50,000, even though Walker is still taking home less than what his salary provides.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHmmm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you were one of the many people who suffered a pay cut during the Great Recession, and your employer later restored most of that money, would you feel you had received a pay increase? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Walker&rsquo;s case, the pay cuts were voluntary, but otherwise the scenario is the same.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Advancing Wisconsin executive director Meagan Mahaffey if she had more to back up her organization&rsquo;s claim. She said that when Walker made his 2002 promise to return $60,000 per year, he &quot;did not indicate that it was a temporary pledge.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNor did he say it was an eternal one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Walker was upfront with voters when he set the salary giveback for his current term as county executive at $10,000 per year. He was re-elected on that basis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s review our math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn support of Democrat Tom Barrett, Advancing Wisconsin is claiming Republican candidate Scott Walker &quot;increased his own pay by $50,000&quot; as Milwaukee County executive. To be sure, Walker used to give back $60,000 of his pay and he&rsquo;s now giving back $10,000. It&rsquo;s a smaller giveback, but follow us closely here, still a giveback. To say otherwise, is a cheap shot and, frankly, turns math on its head.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll light up the group&rsquo;s shot in the dark: Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-28T18:20:46.809444", "ruling_date": "2010-10-29T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Group says GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker gave himself a $50,000 raise as Milwaukee County executive", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-says-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-scott-walke", "ruling_link_text": "With group's upside down math, giving back less means getting paid more", "ruling_state": "Wisconsin", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAdvancing Wisconsin campaign <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/barrett_walker_1022101.pdf\">flier</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Advancing Wisconsin executive director Meagan Mahaffey, Oct. 22, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/29505169.html\">Walker would lower salary givebacks</a>, March 19, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/06/scott-walker/gop-governor-candidate-scott-walker-says-he-has-gi/\">GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker says he has given back more than $370,000 of his salary to Milwaukee County</a>, Oct. 6, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 808, "last_name": "Advancing Wisconsin", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "advancing-wisconsin", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup___________________________.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/808/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker &quot;increased his own pay by $50,000.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "campaign literature distributed by an outside group", "statement_date": "2010-10-28", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
