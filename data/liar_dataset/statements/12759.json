Ted Cruz, had never denied that his father was in a 1963 photo with Lee Harvey Oswald, who went on to assassinate President John F. Kennedy that November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a rally, Trump initially told supporters he doesn&rsquo;t want the backing of Cruz, whose convention speech two days earlier drew boos for not including a Trump endorsement; the Texan did offer congratulations.&nbsp;Next, Trump resurrected his unconfirmed claim about Oswald and Rafael Cruz, the senator&rsquo;s father, possibly knowing one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said: &quot;All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. Instead he said, &lsquo;Donald Trump.&rsquo; I had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that frankly, in many respects, should be very respected.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2016, PolitiFact found incorrect and ridiculous--<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/03/donald-trump/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-linking-ted-cruzs-f/\">Pants on Fire</a>--Trump&rsquo;s claim that Cruz&rsquo;s father was with Oswald before Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no evidence&nbsp;the man next to Oswald in the black-and-white photo published in the Enquirer was the elder Cruz. Notably, facial recognition experts advised that no such match could be made; meantime, historians found no corroborating records. The Enquirer never said how it determined the man in the photo with Oswald was Rafael Cruz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it still be that Sen. Cruz never denied his father was in the photo?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our inquiry on this point, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out a statement the Cruz campaign gave to the McClatchy News Service in April 2016 at the time the photo in question was printed on the Enquirer&rsquo;s cover. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cruz campaign&rsquo;s communications director, Alice Stewart, said then: &quot;The story is false; that is not Rafael in the picture,&quot;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article73449297.html\">according to the Miami Herald&rsquo;s April 22, 2016 news story</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart&rsquo;s &quot;not Rafael&quot; declaration appears to have gotten&nbsp;play. We found it in stories or web posts on the <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article73449297.html\">McClatchy website</a> and for the conservative web network <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/05/04/trump-is-asked-if-hell-apologize-for-linking-cruz-to-jfk-assassin-lee-harvey-oswald-listen-to-his-response/\">The Blaze</a> plus in the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-suggests-ted-cruzs-father-helped-jfk-assassin-2363323\">International Business Times</a>, on the <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/05/trumps-tall-tabloid-tale/\">FactCheck.org</a> fact-checking site and on sites for <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/cruz-to-trump-my-father-is-not-linked-to-jfk-165004201.html\">Yahoo!

Later that day, at an Indiana campaign event, Cruz spoke to reporters, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql74N5QkNC4\">saying</a>: &quot;This morning Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Let&rsquo;s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position, this is just kooky.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said the Enquirer &quot;just spread lies, blatant lies&quot; and described the article as &quot;this idiotic story about JFK.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, &nbsp;on May 3, 2016, Ben Jacobs, political reporter for the Guardian, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BANQVE/status/727549497975398400\">tweeted a statement</a> regarding the claim that Jacobs generally attributed to the Cruz campaign. It said: &quot;It&rsquo;s embarrassing that anyone would enable Trump to discuss this. It&rsquo;s a garbage story and clearly Donald wants to talk about garbage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same day, Rafael Cruz <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ted-cruzs-father-rafael-calls-donald-trumps-lee/story?id=38851736\">told ABC News</a> in a TV interview that the links insinuated between him and Oswald were &quot;ludicrous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was never in New Orleans at that time,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the day after the Republican convention that Cruz &quot;never denied&quot; his father was pictured with Oswald before Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This spring, Cruz called the National Enquirer story &quot;lies.&quot; &nbsp;Earlier, a&nbsp;Cruz camp spokeswoman said outright&nbsp;the elder Cruz wasn&rsquo;t in the published photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s far enough&nbsp;from &quot;never denied,&quot;&nbsp;it makes Trump&#39;s claim incorrect and ridiculous.&nbsp;Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>PANTS ON FIRE</strong></em> &ndash;
