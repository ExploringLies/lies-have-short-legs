They can be anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We stumbled across an interesting factoid recently while flipping through a Snapchat story documenting First Lady Michelle Obama&rsquo;s visit to West Africa and Morocco from June 27 to July 1. Obama just joined Snapchat, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/michelle-obama-is-now-on-snapchat/\">if you&rsquo;re interested</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snapchats disappear, but we were able to grab a screengrab with a sobering claim about illiteracy rates among women in Morocco. The <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4_0DHGsOS2YLUF4UGZjRVFBZWRabUs2NnA2YzgxcXZKdElr/view?usp=sharing\">snap</a> had the headline &quot;Moroccan illiteracy&quot; and said that &quot;90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that true? Or should this claim disappear right along with your Snapchat?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tracking the claim to its source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The journey of this claim is particularly interesting, and shows the perils of how incorrect or outdated statistics can be repeated over and over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The snap cites as its source a <a href=\"http://www.vitalvoices.org/blog/2011/09/moroccos-future-depends-women\">blog post</a> by Vital Voices, a non-profit that advances women&rsquo;s causes around the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That actually is a reposting of an article from the IntLawGrrls website, a blog dedicated to discussion of international law and policy. The <a href=\"http://www.intlawgrrls.com/2011/09/moroccos-future-depends-on-women.html\">original</a> IntLawGrrls post is from September 2011 and was written by Christie Edwards, the current director of international humanitarian law at the American Red Cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edwards claimed in her piece that &quot;recent surveys in Morocco estimated the country&rsquo;s illiteracy rate to be approximately 55 percent of all women. Fully 90 percent of rural women in Morocco are illiterate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edwards&rsquo; blog cites a <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/morocco_statistics.html#80\">UNICEF table of statistics</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that table doesn&rsquo;t correspond to her figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UNICEF table only lists an overall literacy rate of 74 percent for women 15-24 in Morocco (or an illiteracy rate of 26 percent). It makes no mention of illiteracy rates for a wider age range of women or for rural women specifically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we asked Edwards where she got her data from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman told us the statistic actually comes from a 2004 <a href=\"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACW877.pdf#page=28\">USAID report</a> on education in the Muslim world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report includes, without citation, the following passage: &quot;Literacy levels remain very low: 63 percent for men and 38 percent for women. Illiteracy is a particular problem for women in rural areas, where nine out of 10 women are illiterate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim that nine out of 10 rural Moroccan women are illiterate goes back even further, to a <a href=\"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM576.pdf\">1996 USAID resource request report</a> that claims, &quot;Women remain especially disadvantaged by low literacy (13% of rural women are literate).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So to recap, a 2016 Snapchat relies on a crosspost of a 2011 blog that erroneously cites UNICEF data when in fact it&rsquo;s coming from a 2004 USAID report that is using a 1996 USAID resource request as is its foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that sounds fishy, it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Illiteracy in Morocco</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out the current illiteracy rate among Moroccan women, we examined public records maintained by UNESCO&rsquo;s Institute for Statistics. The website&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/DataCentre/Pages/country-profile.aspx?code=MAR&amp;regioncode=40525\">profile on Morocco</a> lists a literacy rate of around 62.05 percent for women aged 15 years and older in 2015, which translates to an illiteracy rate of 37.95 percent.&nbsp;<em>(Correction:&nbsp;An earlier version of this fact-check listed a different percentage.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The database doesn&rsquo;t give specific information about illiteracy for rural versus urban women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leonardo Menchini, the head of the social inclusion section at UNICEF Morocco, shared the most recent data on illiteracy rates for urban and rural populations with PolitiFact. <a href=\"http://rgphentableaux.hcp.ma/Default1/\">UNICEF&rsquo;s data</a> come from the 2014 Moroccan census.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_6ae121e1-cf36-4e96-a04e-8c4de64d2145\" title=\"Moroccan illiteracy rates \" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?2tb\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The takeaway: illiteracy remains an issue for females in Morocco, but not near the levels seen in the Snapchat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Snapchat story featuring First Lady Michelle Obama claimed that, in Morocco, &quot;90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That data is, in some cases, at least 20 years old -- way older than Snapchat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim cites old data from a report in 2004, that tracks back to a 1996 USAID request report. The most recent information from UNESCO and UNICEF indicate that Morocco&rsquo;s illiteracy among women is still relatively high (60 percent in rural areas and 42 percent overall), but much lower than what the snap says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/452873e9-e53d-4ae9-9483-c9f7c3576d83\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/452873e9-e53d-4ae9-9483-c9f7c3576d83</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-14T09:45:52.431825", "ruling_date": "2016-07-14T10:27:32", "ruling_headline": "Snapchat highlights decades old data as part of Michelle Obama visit to Morocco", "ruling_headline_slug": "snapchat-highlights-decades-old-data-part-michelle", "ruling_link_text": "A 2016 social media platform using 1996 data", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email with Jenelle Eli, International Communications at the American Red Cross, July 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Leonardo Menchini, head of the social inclusion section at UNICEF Morocco, July 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haut Commisariat au Plan, &quot;<a href=\"http://rgphentableaux.hcp.ma/Default1/\">Data from the 2014 general census of population and housing</a>,&quot; accessed July 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snapchat, &quot;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4_0DHGsOS2YLUF4UGZjRVFBZWRabUs2NnA2YzgxcXZKdElr/view\">Moroccan illiteracy</a>,&quot; June 30, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USAID, &quot;<a href=\"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABM576.pdf\">Results review and resource request</a>,&quot; March 1996</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USAID, &quot;<a href=\"http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACW877.pdf#page=28\">Strengthening education in the muslim world</a>,&quot; April 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UNESCO Institute for Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/DataCentre/Pages/country-profile.aspx?code=MAR&amp;regioncode=40525\">Morocco</a>,&quot; accessed July 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UNICEF, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/morocco_statistics.html#80\">At a glance: Morocco</a>,&quot; accessed July 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitalvoices.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.vitalvoices.org/blog/2011/09/moroccos-future-depends-women\">Morocco&rsquo;s future depends on women</a>,&quot; September 17, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3589, "last_name": "Snapchat", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "snapchat", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/syFSpLD0.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Global", "edition": "Global News Service", "edition_slug": "global-news", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 60, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Global News Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/60/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3589/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.snapchat.com"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate&quot; in Morocco.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a snapchat", "statement_date": "2016-06-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 146, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/146/", "subject": "Women", "subject_slug": "women", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Snapchat highlights decades old data as part of Michelle Obama visit to Morocco"}
