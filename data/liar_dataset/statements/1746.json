Charlie Crist, March 28, 2010</strong><br /><br /><em>Says he has  decided to run for the U.S. Senate as \"a candidate without party  affiliation.\"</em><br /><br /><strong>- Gov. Charlie Crist, April 29, 2010</strong><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Gov.  Charlie Crist's announcement on April 29, 2010 that he'll bolt the  Republican Party and run for the U.S. Senate as an independent would  have been an unimaginable proposition just a few months ago.<br /><br />After  all, Crist was considered a 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate and a  potential rising star. Ten months ago, Crist led former House Speaker  Marco Rubio by more than 30 percentage points in Senate primary polls.<br /><br />And  just one month ago, Crist categorically dismissed the possibility he'd  run for the Senate as anything other than a Republican.<br /><br />In a  March 28 televised debate on <em>Fox News Sunday, </em>he told moderator Chris  Wallace he would run as a Republican in the primary. Here's the  exchange:<br /><br />WALLACE: There have been persistent rumors in  Florida that you are so far behind, at least currently, in the polls &mdash;  double digits to Mr. Rubio &mdash; that you may run instead as an independent.  Here is your chance to dispel all the rumors. Are you willing to pledge  right here, right now that you will run in the Republican primary for  the U.S. Senate and not run as an independent?<br /><br />CRIST: I'm running  as a Republican. I'm very proud to be from the party of Abraham  Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, others that really have stood up for our  party, like Ronald Reagan. This is a great party. It has a great future.  We have a great opportunity to win in November. It's important that we  put a candidate up that can win in November.<br /><br />WALLACE: So are you  ruling out that you will file as an Independent by the April 30th  deadline?<br /><br />CRIST: That's right. That's right. I'm running as a  Republican.<br /><br />Crist campaign manager Eric Eikenberg also tried to  stop the run-as-an-independent talk in a April 8 press release.<br /><br />\"To  put these rumors to rest once and for all, as we have said countless  times before, Governor Crist is running for the United States Senate as a  Republican,\" Eikenberg said. \"He will not run as an Independent or as a  No Party Affiliation.<br /><br />\"This should completely and utterly put to  rest any of the unfounded rumors coming from the Rubio campaign that  Governor Crist would run as anything other than the Republican that he  is.\"<br /><br />Well, maybe they weren't so unfounded. <br /><br />On April 19,  2010, Crist told newspaper reporters that he was considering running as  an independent. Then at a April 29 rally in his hometown of St.  Petersburg, he made it official.<br /><br />He said he was seeking the  Senate seat as \"a candidate without party affiliation.\"<br /><br />At a  rally in St. Petersburg, Crist said, \"I believe in democracy and that  people have the right to choose -- always. Now I could have chosen to  stay in the primary. But frankly for me, it's your decision. It's not  one club's decision or another -- or even a club within that club. It is  a decision too important -- it is a decision for all the people in  Florida to be able to make. So that's why we go straight to November. We  give you the chance to make that decision.\"<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/apr/20/charlie-crist/crist-said-he-wasnt-thinking-about-it-now-he/\" target=\"_blank\">We  previously have tracked</a> Crist's waffling on running as a Republican  or an independent, and rated his differing comments as a Half Flip on  our Flip-O-Meter.
