It would be home to a graduate-level engineering campus and &quot;a collaborative research powerhouse.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>May 2009:</strong> The County Board <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/45736387.html\">agrees to </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/45736387.html\">sell</a> 88 acres on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa -- near the medical center and research park -- to an affiliate of the <a href=\"http://www.uwmrealestatefoundation.org/message.aspx\">UWM Real Estate Foundation</a>, for $13.6 million. UWM says the &nbsp;Innovation Park project will draw more research funding, with business spinoffs creating jobs throughout southeastern Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>December 2010</strong>: The foundation <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/111972864.html\">says it has </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/111972864.html\">raised</a> the $5 million it needs for the down payment on the land. The foundation also says it will ask the county to postpone for two years, until January 2014, the due date for a $5 million installment payment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlong the way, Wauwatosa <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/92929644.html\">approved </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/92929644.html\">zoning</a> for the land and agreed to create the $12 million tax incremental finance district to pay for public improvements, such as roads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Sullivan for support for his claim that he led the Innovation Park effort.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis Senate staff provided <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/SullivanInnovation.doc\">seven </a><a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/SullivanInnovation.doc\">documents</a> Sullivan wrote, including letters he sent to city, county and state officials.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Sullivan said: &quot;Within the Legislature, I was absolutely the champion for that project. That&rsquo;s what &lsquo;led&rsquo; means.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSullivan also acknowledged that &quot;it is a group effort to get a major project like that done.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Senate, however, had no direct role in Innovation Park. Those who were involved with the effort characterized Sullivan&rsquo;s role as supportive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere is what they said:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Tom Luljak, UWM vice chancellor for university relations</strong>: Sullivan &quot;was a very strong advocate,&quot; but &quot;I don&rsquo;t think there was any one single person who was the champion&quot; of Innovation Park.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Harold Mester, spokesman for Acting County Executive Lee Holloway:</strong> Sullivan supported Innovation Park, but was not involved in the land sale negotiations between UWM and the county.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Wauwatosa Mayor Jill Didier</strong>: Sullivan was a &quot;very well spoken&quot; supporter, but the major players were UWM and county officials, along with the city.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDidier added: &quot;I think, in the world of politics, a lot of people want to take credit. But the reality is it takes a lot of hands to get the job done.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong those taking credit is Holloway, who is also running for county executive in the April election. He said in December that if not for his efforts, the county would have received only $7 million from UWM for the land, instead of $13.6 million.

We&rsquo;ll just give you our assessment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn trying to retain his state Senate seat, Sullivan declared he &quot;led the effort&quot; to put a new UWM campus in Wauwatosa. The major work for Innovation Park, however, was done by UWM, Milwaukee County and the City of Wauwatosa; the state Senate never got involved. Those close to the project said Sullivan played a supportive role but certainly didn&rsquo;t lead the effort.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-05T19:13:54.883292", "ruling_date": "2011-01-06T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Milwaukee County executive candidate Jim Sullivan says he led the effort to build a new UWM engineering campus in Wauwatosa", "ruling_headline_slug": "milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jim-sullivan-", "ruling_link_text": "Supportive?
