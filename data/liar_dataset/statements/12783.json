At the end of the 30-second video a voice says, &quot;So you treat women with respect.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video shifts to a younger Trump saying sheepishly, &quot;I can&#39;t say that either&quot; and offering a half-laugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clip is so short, we wondered if it was an accurate representation of the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed the Democratic National Committee about its source. They couldn&#39;t immediately provide it but, meanwhile, we found it thanks to The Washington Post Fact-Checker <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/24/pro-clinton-ads-quote-trumps-comments-on-women-and-nuclear-weapons-without-context/\">examination of two pro-Clinton ads</a> in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video shown at the Democratic convention was originally an ad <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QZFB6gqPqe0\">released by the Hillary Clinton campaign</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source of the quote comes from a 39-minute <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EiVRAf9r36M?t=23m15s\">interview with Howard Stern</a> conducted in 1993 on the E! cable channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stern is not shown in the clip, although some might recognize his voice. The shock-jock is known for getting his guests to say outrageous things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interview was conducted after <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=new%20york%20magazine%20donald%20trump%20november%201992&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">a New York magazine article on Trump</a> said, &quot;His contempt for beautiful women who liked to be abused is boundless.&quot; The article characterized his philosophy as, &quot;You have to treat them like s---,&quot; a characterization by author Julie Baumgold, not a direct quote from Trump himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the interview, Stern asks Trump about the quote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, I never said that,&quot; Trump responds.&quot;But it was attributed to me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some chatter by Stern, Trump again denies saying it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I see,&quot; says Stern. &quot;So you treat women with respect.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump smiles. &quot;Ahhhh. I can&#39;t say that either,&quot; he says with a chortle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alright, good,&quot; says Stern. &quot;Somewhere in between.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Trump adds, &quot;I treat women with great respect,&quot; his tone sounding more serious this time, but it&#39;s not completely clear because the camera, at this point, is on Stern instead of Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stern then insists, with the help of a chart, that Trump rank his wife and girlfriends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the Clinton campaign if Trump&#39;s comment was taken out of context, deputy communications director Christina Reynolds&nbsp;responded with an emailed statement that&nbsp;&quot;in a conversation about whether he respects (women), his first inclination is to say that he &#39;can&#39;t say.&#39;&nbsp;That statement, coming during an exchange about previous disrespectful comments about women, speaks volumes and is perfectly in context with his lifelong record.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton, in a campaign ad shown at the Democratic convention, said that when an interviewer asked Donald Trump if he treats women with respect, Trump replied, &quot;I can&#39;t say that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four-second clip has not been doctored. But this is an example of where context can be crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It omits the fact that Stern is the interviewer. The opening question of whether Trump said he treats women like feces, Trump&#39;s denial, Stern&#39;s assessment that it&#39;s &quot;somewhere in between&quot; and Trump&#39;s subsequent response that &quot;I treat women with great respect&quot; are all missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because so much is ignored in this brief clip&mdash; information that could give a different impression &mdash; we rate the claim Mostly False.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e51f9c5-2a3d-4dd0-a2c3-6d8f7edac738\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e51f9c5-2a3d-4dd0-a2c3-6d8f7edac738</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-26T23:59:01.199597", "ruling_date": "2016-07-27T00:21:39", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton video says Donald Trump admitted that he can't say he treats women with respect", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-video-says-donald-trump-admitted-h", "ruling_link_text": "Clip ignores key context", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/24/pro-clinton-ads-quote-trumps-comments-on-women-and-nuclear-weapons-without-context/\">Pro-Clinton ads quote Trump&#39;s comments on women and nuclear weapons without context</a>,&quot; June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/EiVRAf9r36M?t=26m20s\">Howard Stern : E!
