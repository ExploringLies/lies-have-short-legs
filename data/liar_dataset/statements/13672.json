(The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBVA Bancomer, a Mexican economic forecaster, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-economy-remittances-idUSKBN14M115\">has projected</a> that once all the data for 2016 is tallied, Mexicans will have sent $27 billion in remittances into Mexico in 2016 -- a one-year record, and an increase of more than $2 billion over 2015. (Part of the reason for the uptick, <a href=\"https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/170105_FlashMigracion_eng.pdf\">the group says</a>, was a surge in remittances in November with Trump&rsquo;s election, driven by widespread concerns that he may cut off remittances in the future.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These totals are in line with U.S. government <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675248.pdf\">data</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we found at least two different types of money flows from the United States to Mexico that are bigger than remittances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ranking first is the money spent by United States consumers and companies on good&nbsp;old-fashioned Mexican exports -- everything from manufactured goods to oil to agricultural products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/mexico\">federal data</a>, the United States in 2015 imported Mexican goods totaling $295 billion. That pot of money is more than 10 times bigger than the amount of remittances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest category of Mexican exports to the United States --&nbsp;auto vehicles and parts -- was by itself north of $100 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, foreign direct investment by the United States <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/infographic-foreign-direct-investment-mexico\">totaled</a> $28 billion in 2015 -- a bit higher than the projected remittances for 2016 and clearly higher than the total of remittances for 2015, which was $24.8 billion. Foreign direct investment is <a href=\"http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=foreign-direct-investment\">defined</a> as &quot;investment from one country into another, normally by companies rather than governments, that involves establishing operations or acquiring tangible assets, including stakes in other businesses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three experts in U.S.-Mexico economic ties -- Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; Mary C. King, a Portland State University economist; and Robert A. Blecker, an American University economist -- concurred with our analysis of the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Remittances are important -- just far from No. 1,&quot; Blecker said.&nbsp;&quot;And from a Mexican point of view, it&rsquo;s a huge disappointment that remittances are so high relative to foreign direct investment and tourism, which would be much more positive sources of income. Nevertheless, they are not the biggest -- not nearly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conway said, &quot;Here&#39;s the fact. The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A projected $27 billion influx of cash from the United States into Mexico is nothing to sneeze at, and this money makes a real difference in the lives of many Mexicans who have relatives living and working in the United States, whether legally or illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, contrary to what Conway said, remittances do not rank No. 1 on the U.S.-Mexico income flow list. Rather, U.S. purchases of Mexican goods -- to say nothing of services -- are more than 10 times the size of remittances. And remittances also trail foreign direct investment as a source of income in Mexico. We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\">\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">Politifact</a></div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-false.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">4</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">6</div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-false.jpg\" style=\"display:none\" /> Politifact Rating:\r\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\">&quot;Here&#39;s the fact: The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back.&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Kellyanne Conway</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Counselor to the president</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<img src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/Capture.JPG\" style=\"display:none\" />\r\n<div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\">an interview on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Friday, January 27, 2017</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">-01/-27/2017</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/kellyanne-conway/kellyanne-conway-incorrect-worker-remittances-mexi/\">Read More</a>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right\"><a href=\"#\">info</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-30T16:56:09.172394", "ruling_date": "2017-01-30T17:35:11", "ruling_headline": "Kellyanne Conway incorrect that worker remittances to Mexico are 'No. 1' income flow", "ruling_headline_slug": "kellyanne-conway-incorrect-worker-remittances-mexi", "ruling_link_text": "Value of Mexican exports to U.S. is 10 times bigger", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Kellyanne Conway, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY52xe0xzAc\">interview</a> with <em>CBS This Morning</em>, Jan. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/c2010.html\">U.S. Imports from Mexico by 5-digit End-Use Code, 2006-2015</a>,&quot; accessed Jan. 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of the U.S. Trade representative, <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/mexico\">Mexico main page</a>, accessed Jan. 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Mexico Institute, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/infographic-foreign-direct-investment-mexico\">Foreign Direct Investment in Mexico</a>,&quot; Apr 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government Accountability Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675248.pdf\">International Remittances: Actions Needed to Address Unreliable Official U.S. Estimate</a>,&quot; February 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Observatory of Economic Complexity, <a href=\"http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/mex/\">Mexico main page</a>, accessed Jan. 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBVA Research, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/170105_FlashMigracion_eng.pdf\">Faced with possible restrictions, remittances grew by 24.7% in November</a>,&quot; Jan 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-economy-remittances-idUSKBN14M115\">Remittances to Mexico jump by most in 10 years after Trump win</a>,&quot; Jan. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J.W.
