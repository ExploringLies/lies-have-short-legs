Now they want to legislate what drinks kids can get at restaurants,&quot; claimed host Ed Henry early in the segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a bill that&rsquo;s been proposed in the state of California (that would) only give children two options at restaurants: either milk or water,&quot; he continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A second host then adds: &quot;Of course, obviously, I&rsquo;m the parent, I want to be able to make that decision. Where does it go? Some people in California think dairy is bad&hellip; . Or maybe it&rsquo;s wheat. So how far will this go? That&rsquo;s the question.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know: Does the bill really restrict kids drinks to only milk or water? Or is there more to the legislation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our&nbsp;research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislation in question is <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1192\">Senate Bill 1192</a> introduced by Democratic State Sen. Bill Monning. He has championed it as a way to encourage healthy beverage options for children. The bill has gained attention from many <a href=\"https://patch.com/california/pleasanthill/s/ght8d/restaurants-can-only-give-kids-water-milk-under-california-bill\">news outlets</a> in addition to Fox and many have offered misleading or incomplete ways to describe the legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill received final approval from the California Legislature on Aug. 21 and was sent to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown&#39;s desk for consideration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s part of what the bill says: &quot;This bill would require a restaurant, as defined, that sells a children&rsquo;s meal that includes a beverage, to make the default beverage water, sparkling water, or flavored water, as specified, or unflavored milk or a nondairy milk alternative, as specified.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fox hosts generally get that portion of the bill correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they leave out, until the end of the segment, any reference to a key provision of the bill: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bill would not prohibit a restaurant&rsquo;s ability to sell, or a customer&rsquo;s ability to purchase, an alternative beverage if the purchaser requests one.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hosts also fail to mention that the bill applies only to restaurants with kids menus, though a chyron on the screen does reference kids&rsquo; meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third host near the end of the segment added: &quot;The parents have to actively ask to have soda for their children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the bill, and if their child is having a kids meal, that appears to be correct. Some restaurants have already removed soda from their kids meal menus. McDonald&rsquo;s, for example, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/09/26/226564560/mcdonalds-says-bye-bye-to-sugary-sodas-in-happy-meals\">removed it</a> in 2013, though the restaurant doesn&rsquo;t turn down parents who ask for sodas with their child&rsquo;s Happy Meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Fox News spokeswoman declined to speak on the record about the show&rsquo;s presentation of the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox wasn&#39;t the only news outlet to leave the wrong impression.&nbsp;TheHill.com, a political news site, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1031294006079176705\">tweeted</a>&nbsp;&quot;California bill blocks restaurants from serving kids anything to drink but water, milk.&quot; Meanwhile, a&nbsp;patch.com news&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patch.com/california/pleasanthill/s/ght8d/restaurants-can-only-give-kids-water-milk-under-california-bill\">headline</a> read &quot;Kids Menus Can Only Have Water, Milk Under California Bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview, Monning described the Fox&nbsp;segment as &quot;misleading.&quot; He added that &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; appeared to have shaped the story &quot;to fit preconceived notions&quot; about the proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous health organizations support the bill and there&rsquo;s no known opposition from other interest groups, according to <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1192\">reports</a> by state Senate and Assembly committee staff. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a recent &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;&nbsp;segment and on the show&rsquo;s Twitter page, the claim was made:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California is proposing to legislate what drinks restaurants can serve your kids, only giving two options: milk or water.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim ignores the critical fact that the bill allows restaurants, upon request, to serve children other drinks such as juice or soda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also disregards the fact that the bill would only apply to restaurants with a kids menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the show&rsquo;s hosts, along with a tweet following the segment, offered deceptive portrayals of the bill, leaving the average person with the impression it could be milk, water or nothing for kids at California restaurants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third host then noted parents could still request soda for their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That clarification, buried near the end of the segment, doesn&rsquo;t balance out an otherwise misleading presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the show&#39;s claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-21T19:44:26.289032", "ruling_date": "2018-08-21T17:18:53", "ruling_headline": "Misleading claim by \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 on California kids meal bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "misleading-claim-fox-friends-california-kids-meal-", "ruling_link_text": "Sodas, juice would be available upon request", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;Fox &amp; Friends,&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/1031151926623330310\">segment and tweet on California Senate Bill 1192</a>, Aug. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate Bill 1192, <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1192\">text</a>, accessed August 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caley Cronin, spokeswoman, Fox News, phone interview Aug. 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California State Sen.
