Coloradans will decide whether to create the giant system when they vote on Amendment 69 in the November election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Supporters estimate ColoradoCare would have $38 billion in annual revenues,&quot; the report states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If it were a private company, ColoradoCare would rank about 80th in the Fortune 500, just behind New York Life Insurance and ahead of well&shy;-known companies such as American Express, 21st Century Fox, 3M, Sears, Nike and McDonald&#39;s.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Need more perspective? Colorado&#39;s annual state budget is $25.7 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We examined the statement that ColoradoCare&rsquo;s projected revenues would be $38 billion and overshadow huge corporates. We found that the number is right in theory, but it depends on the federal government signing off on a first-of-its-kind health system for Colorado.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How ColoradoCare would work</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, here&rsquo;s how ColoradoCare would work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If approved by voters, Colorado would be the first state to have a health care system where every resident has coverage financed by taxes instead of private insurance premiums, according to the Colorado Health Institute report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The institute estimates that 83 percent of Colorado&rsquo;s population -- about 4.4 million people -- would be eligible for primary health insurance coverage through ColoradoCare. The remaining 17 percent of residents would continue to be covered by federal programs, including Medicare and the Veterans Administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People would still choose their own health care providers, but ColoradoCare would pay the bills. Members would not have to pay an annual deductible, but they would have co-pays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system would be controlled by a powerful 21-member board, elected by the system&rsquo;s members in seven districts across the state. The governor and legislature would have no role, except to select an interim board until elections were held. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.couniversalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/addendumwith2019projectionsplusappendixv5.0,8.3.15.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>An economic analysis by supporters</u></a> says ColoradoCare would produce a net savings of $4.5 billion for residents and businesses by eliminating private insurance profits, streamlining paperwork and more efficiently delivering services. <a href=\"http://www.coloradansforcoloradans.com/amendment-69-facts-amend-coloradocare-facts-coloradocarefacts-ballot-vote-info-information/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Opponents say</u></a> the proposed amendment will be costly, it won&#39;t impact rising health care costs and it will hamper the state&rsquo;s ability to attract and retain medical providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ColoradoCareYes campaign confirmed the proposed nonprofit health system is projected to have $38 billion in annual revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About $25 billion would come from state taxes. Employers would pay 6.67 percent in payroll taxes and employees would contribute 3.33 percent, for a total of 10 percent of the payroll. Self-employed people would pay 10 percent of their net income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The projected $25 billion in tax revenues have been independently confirmed by an economist at the Colorado Legislative Council, which provided a revenue impact report to the state board that reviews the language and legality of an initiative&#39;s ballot title and summary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the rest of its annual revenues, supporters say ColoradoCare would apply for waivers from the federal government<strong>, </strong>so that ColoradoCare takes over the state roles and funding for Medicaid ($10.8 billion) and the Affordable Care Act ($700 million). Out-of-pocket costs for medical care and dental care would each provide an estimated $1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But&nbsp;experts said obtaining the federal waivers is a challenging process -- and there&rsquo;s no certainty of success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning on Jan. 1, states can apply for a federal waiver to create innovative, alternative health care programs that would take the place of the Affordable Care Act -- while staying true to its goals. ColoradoCare would have to pass a rigorous federal review, showing it would deliver coverage that&#39;s at least as comprehensive and affordable as the so-called Obamacare program<strong>, </strong>while covering the same amount of people. ColoradoCare would have to stay &quot;revenue neutral&quot; and not cost more than the existing federal program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Federal waivers, funding &lsquo;not a sure thing&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the chances of obtaining the waivers and the federal funds that go with them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Definitely, I would say it&rsquo;s not a sure thing,&quot; said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who specializes in health care reform, an issue she worked on for both the administrations of President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, if approved by voters, ColoradoCare would be among the first states to seek an Affordable Care Act (ACA)<strong> </strong>waiver and bring &quot;the most far-reaching health care reform in any state since the ACA,&quot; according to the Colorado Health Institute report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s advantages for being the first one in the door. It lets you kind of establish the framework for the debate that&#39;s going follow,&quot; Pollitz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicaid waivers aren&rsquo;t automatic, either, though several states, including Colorado, have received the so-called 1115 waivers -- named for a Section 1115 of the Social Security Act</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;1115 waivers require a lot of work and back-and-forth between the state and the federal government and compliance with a number of criteria, including budget neutrality,&quot; said Elisabeth Arenales, the health care program director for the Colorado Center on Law and Policy. The center&nbsp;hasn&#39;t reviewed or taken a position on Amendment 69.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;States have to be careful in how they negotiate those waivers because they&#39;re essentially locked into a spending contract, and they need to be very mindful that they&#39;re both not costing the federal government any additional money but also that their projections of state spending are accurate,&quot; Arenales said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballot initiative&rsquo;s language makes it clear that getting the waivers are a do-or-die matter for ColoradoCare. No waivers means no program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the heading &quot;Termination of ColoradoCare&rsquo;s Operations,&quot; the initiative states: &quot;If the board determines that ColoradoCare has not received the waivers, exemptions, and agreements from the federal government sufficient for its fiscally sound operation, the board shall: (a) shut down operations and return unused funds; (b) notify the governor of the State of Colorado of ColoradoCare&#39;s inability to function.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ColoradoCareYES campaign spokesman Owen Perkins acknowledged the waivers&rsquo; critical importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;ColoradoCare doesn&#39;t move forward without that,&quot; he said. But, at the same time, he said it should be reassuring to Colorado voters that health care system couldn&rsquo;t launch until it passes a high bar set by the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think everybody in Colorado should be thankful that there is that vigorous standard,&quot; Perkins said. &quot;That ensures that we can&#39;t go into this willy-nilly. It could pass with a 75-percent vote and everything look perfect, but if it doesn&#39;t receive that waiver, it&#39;s not going to happen.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stressed that the architects of ColoradoCare have done their homework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Colorado Health Institute is accurate in saying, given ColoradoCare&rsquo;s projected $38 billion in revenues, if it were a private company is would rank about 80th on the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fortune 500</u></a> just behind New York Life Insurance ($38.7 billion in revenues). It&rsquo;s revenues would be larger than American Express &nbsp;($35.9 billion), Twenty-First Century Fox ($31.86 billion), 3M ($31.82 billion), Sears ($31.2 billion), Nike ($27.8 billion) and McDonald&rsquo;s ($27.4 billion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On paper, the ColoradoCareYES campaign&rsquo;s projected state tax and federal funding revenues add up to $38 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Colorado Health Institute analysis said the Colorado universal health care system would have a projected $38 billion in revenues, larger than major corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers seem to add up if everything with ColoradoCare goes according to its supporters&rsquo; plans. The revenues would be larger than some big companies.&nbsp;However, the health care plan&nbsp;has a<strong> </strong>make-or-break need to obtain federal waivers that would allow it to assume the roles of state Medicaid and Affordable Care Act programs.
