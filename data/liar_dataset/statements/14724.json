And it is one he has made repeatedly, including <a href=\"http://www.wkow.com/story/36760860/2017/11/03/dan-kohl-discusses-challenge-to-glenn-grothman-on-capital-city-sunday\">on TV</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanKohlWI/status/872499288269520898\">on</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanKohlWI/status/877701039985700867\">Twitter</a>, in a campaign <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsDeo2xkBuI&amp;t=10s\">video</a> and in his campaign <a href=\"https://www.kohlforcongress.com/2017/06/06/dan-kohl-announces-campaign-congress/\">announcement</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ll see, there&rsquo;s a solid source to back up the claim. But its data is nearly a year old and it acknowledges it uses only one way to measure partisanship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One ranking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html\">Bipartisan Index</a> ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan House member, ahead of only Kansas Republican Tim Huelskamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kohl argues that Grothman is currently the most-partisan because Huelskamp, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/us/politics/tim-huelskamp-roger-marshall-kansas-primary.html\">who lost</a> his run for re-election in 2016, is no longer in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html\">the rankings</a> are for the 114th Congress, which covers Grothman&rsquo;s first two-year term in the House (2015-&rsquo;16). They don&rsquo;t take into account any activity since 2016, including any new member now in a first term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rankings are done by the <a href=\"http://www.thelugarcenter.org/about.html\">Lugar Center</a>, a think tank formed by <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=l000504\">Richard Lugar</a>, an Indiana Republican who served in the U.S. Senate from 1977 to 2013; and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

One had the same finding as the Bipartisan Index -- that <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2016/party-house-republican/bills-with-cosponsors-both-parties-count\">Grothman did not</a> introduce any bill that had a Democratic cosponsor. For the percentage of bills cosponsored by each legislator that were introduced by a member of the other party,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2016/party-house-republican/cosponsored-other-party\">Grothman ranked</a> fifth from the bottom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrothman&#39;s office also cited to us a number of Grothman&rsquo;s bipartisan actions, all during 2017, including: Grothman expressing disagreement with fellow Republicans over legislation; working with U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, on legislation for refinancing student loans; and co-sponsoring a GOP-sponsored bill, also supported by Democrats, to legalize hemp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kohl says Grothman&nbsp;&quot;is the single-most partisan member of the House.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One widely noted index ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan member during the 2015-&rsquo;16 congressional session, above only a member who is no longer in the House. That arguably makes Grothman the most-partisan currently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the index is only one way of defining partisanship, and it doesn&rsquo;t account for any House member activity after 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>div class=&#39;artembed&#39;&gt;See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-07T11:44:19.854237", "ruling_date": "2017-11-08T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Is Wisconsin's Glenn Grothman, as his rival claims, the most-partisan member of the U.S. House?", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsins-glenn-grothman-his-rival-claims-most-pa", "ruling_link_text": "Arguably at the top of one measure of partisanship", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/DanKohlWI/about/?ref=page_internal\">Dan Kohl page</a>, accessed Nov. 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KohlForCongress.com, <a href=\"https://www.kohlforcongress.com/2017/06/06/dan-kohl-announces-campaign-congress/\">news release</a>, June 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WKOW-TV, <a href=\"http://www.wkow.com/story/36760860/2017/11/03/dan-kohl-discusses-challenge-to-glenn-grothman-on-capital-city-sunday\">&quot;Capital City Sunday&quot; interview of Dan Kohl</a>, Nov. 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/wisconsin-voter/2017/06/05/ranking-wisconsins-federal-lawmakers-bipartisanship/369138001/\"> &quot;Ranking Wisconsin&#39;s federal lawmakers for &#39;bipartisanship,&rsquo;&quot;</a> June 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanKohlWI/status/877701039985700867\">Dan Kohl tweet</a>, June 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Rep.
