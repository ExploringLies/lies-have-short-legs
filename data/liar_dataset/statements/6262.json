But hardly an original one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DCCC made an identical Chinese prostitution attack against Jim Renacci, a &nbsp;Republican House member in Ohio. They also used it against Republican congressmen Scott DesJarlais in Tennessee and Jim Gerlach in Pennsylvania.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s behind this lurid campaign finance claim?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur colleagues in PolitiFact Ohio dug into the issue after Renacci was targeted. Here&rsquo;s what they found:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The charge is tied to billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75173.html\">donated millions</a> to Republicans. A fired former employee of Adelson&rsquo;s filed a lawsuit which <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2012/06/28/ex_sands_exec_alleges_prostitution_in_macau_sites/\">alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties</a> his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio continued:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn&rsquo;t spent anything so far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA spokesman for the Adelson&rsquo;s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always &quot;maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson&rsquo;s character.&quot;</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, &nbsp;Adelson said there&rsquo;s not a &quot;shred of evidence&quot; to back his former employee&rsquo;s charges, and &quot;says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) <a href=\"http://www.adelsoncliniclasvegas.com/\">have given millions of dollars to set up clinics</a> around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the &hellip; claims even more preposterous.&quot; &nbsp;Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DCCC says &nbsp;&quot;Adelson has given $5 million to Speaker (John) Boehner&rsquo;s Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, pledged $5 million to Leader (Eric) Cantor&rsquo;s Young Guns Network Super PAC, given $70,800 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and has committed at least $20 million into Karl Rove&rsquo;s American Crossroads.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Adelson has contributed or pledged plenty of money to Republican candidates or committees. That&rsquo;s clear. But the Chinese prostitution link is another matter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how PolitiFact Ohio put it in their review of the claim against Renacci:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson&rsquo;s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC&rsquo;s claim that &quot;foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci&rsquo;s Republican majority?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t think so.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeither do we.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs our Ohio colleagues point out, the allegation that Adelson allowed prostitution at the Macau comes from a fired employee. The DCCC takes that claim and says money from prostitution was included in Adelson&rsquo;s campaign contributions to GOP congressional incumbents -- including Duffy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no evidence that Duffy received contributions from Adelson, and he has no control over contributions to groups that support him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The claim that Adelson&rsquo;s donations to these other groups amount to &lsquo;Chinese prostitution money&rsquo; &nbsp;is dubious enough that inserting the word &lsquo;allegedly&rsquo; can&rsquo;t save it,&quot; PolitiFact Ohio wrote in its assessment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat holds no matter what name is inserted into the cut-and-paste news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou can repeat a claim, but the smell of smoke remains the same.
