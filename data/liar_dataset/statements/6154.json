Tommy Thompson, the frontrunner among four GOP Senate contenders, for his work on behalf of drug and insurance companies after leaving the cabinet of President George W. Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Baldwin dropped a stunner into her remarks about the ex-guv:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Just this week, one of my prospective opponents, Tommy Thompson, went to a tea party event and compared Medicare to welfare, and said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare,&quot; Baldwin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe added, with a touch of outrage: &quot;Do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat will get your attention -- whether you&rsquo;re in Medicare, nearing eligibility or even years away.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Thompson really express a desire to end <a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/publications/pubs/pdf/11306.pdf\">Medicare</a>, the long-running government-run health care program for seniors funded by taxes that come out of workers&rsquo; paychecks?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Thompson&rsquo;s comments</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs backup, Baldwin&rsquo;s campaign cited Thompson&rsquo;s remarks at a June 4, 2012, gathering of the <a href=\"http://lakecountryareadefendersofliberty.webs.com/\">Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Oconomowoc-based group decries excessive government and has a stated goal of &quot;demolishing the growing, socialist &lsquo;nanny state&rsquo; and its programs and legislation, re-instituting personal responsibility and the traditional values of work, merit, integrity, honesty, innovation, accountability, civic participation and civility.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic Party filmed the speech and Baldwin&rsquo;s campaign provided a copy to us. &nbsp;A brief <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/blogs/id/2dMf5KNpaxk\">portion of the speech</a> is linked on the website of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the event, Thompson said Medicare will be broke within a decade and the only way to save it is to give people who turn 55 starting in 2022 a choice of traditional Medicare or purchasing health insurance with a subsidy from the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf that sounds a lot like the plan from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, to reform Medicare, it should. Thompson has endorsed Ryan&rsquo;s plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin used cautious words when she described the Ryan plan, saying it would end Medicare &quot;as we know it.&quot; Others have claimed it would simply<br />\r\n\t&quot;end&quot; Medicare, which PolitiFact National named the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/\">2011 Lie of the Year</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Thompson&rsquo;s remarks -- in a way -- turn the claim on its head. It&rsquo;s a Republican suggesting he would end Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is another piece of background: Thompson didn&rsquo;t say it at the event, but he <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/130949388.html#%21page=5&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">told the Journal Sentinel</a> in 2011 he firmly believes seniors will choose the private insurance option under Ryan&rsquo;s plan over government-run care. &nbsp;Of government-run healthcare, he said he&rsquo;s &quot;always opposed&quot; it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to the speech.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson did, as Baldwin claimed, wrap his argument for Medicare reform in the language of wiping it away and starting fresh.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, he harkened back to his days as Wisconsin governor, and his first-in-the-nation move to replace welfare with a work requirement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told the audience the United States should &quot;change Medicare and Medicaid like I did welfare.&quot; (We previously rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/11/tommy-thompson/did-gop-us-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-end-wel/\">Mostly True</a> Thompson&rsquo;s claim that he &quot;ended welfare&quot; in Wisconsin).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen there was this line, the one Baldwin latched onto:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Who better than me, (who&rsquo;s) already finished one of the entitlement programs and come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the Thompson campaign about the claim and they said it was not a misstatement by the candidate. But campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir offered this somewhat contradictory explanation: Thompson used the phrase &quot;doing away with&quot; in the context of &quot;changing&quot; Medicare, not eliminating it, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe speech itself is hard to decipher. Was Thompson describing his position in support of Ryan&rsquo;s plan as a way of fundamentally changing Medicare? Was his characterization meant to apply to changes he helped make in Medicare when he was the U.S. secretary of health and human services?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his 2011 remarks, Thompson said government-run Medicare could disappear if people are allowed to opt out of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that what he meant?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhatever his meaning, it&rsquo;s clear that Thompson was comfortable uttering the phrase &quot;doing away with Medicare&quot; in the middle of a recitation of his views on transforming the program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the same time, it&rsquo;s clear that further into the speech, after the statement in question, Thompson said he was interested in &quot;saving&quot; it from fiscal extinction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe also framed his views as wanting to &quot;change&quot; Medicare, though in the context of his elimination of welfare in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin doesn&rsquo;t provide those facts. Her comment that Thompson would &quot;do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned&quot; suggests Medicare will be taken away without any option.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin claimed that Thompson &quot;said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare.&quot; He did say it, acknowledges he did not misspeak, and Baldwin accurately repeats the phrase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Baldwin leaves out evidence from Thompson&rsquo;s own mouth that Thompson is talking about a dramatic transformation of Medicare in order to save government health care assistance to seniors, not end it outright.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Truth-O-Meter definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think that fits Baldwin&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-24T18:04:42.781103", "ruling_date": "2012-06-28T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Baldwin says Thompson said he wants to \u2018do away with Medicare\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "baldwin-says-thompson-wants-do-away-medicare", "ruling_link_text": "He said that, more or less ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tEmail interview with John Kraus, spokesman, Baldwin campaign, June 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Brian Nemoir, Thompson campaign spokesman, June 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou Tube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqJT7C_itZE&amp;feature=g-all-u\">video</a> of Baldwin speech at Netroots Nation, June 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYouTube,<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVOh9CDXFa0\"> video</a> of selected Thompson remarks at Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty forum, June 4, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Tammy", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 1410, "last_name": "Baldwin", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "tammy-baldwin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT_Tammy_Baldwin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1410/", "total_count": 49, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.baldwin.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson said he wants to &quot;do away with Medicare.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2012-06-07", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
