The foundation had been told to stop operating, although the post didn&rsquo;t say who or what made such a demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra said the post is definitely incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is full of falsehoods and paranoid nonsense, the details of which are almost certainly deliberately inane. For example, one passage reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;During (Hillary) Clinton&rsquo;s time as Secretary of State, it&rsquo;s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with the creator of ISIS and Osama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Bin Laden, who trained the 9/11 terrorists, was then sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death. Documents linking the Clinton Foundation directly to General George Hammond of SG Command were the final piece of the puzzle.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Gen. George Hammond was the one-time leader of the <a href=\"http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/George_S._Hammond\">fictional Stargate Command</a>. We also highly doubt Osama bin Laden and Hillary Clinton went toe-to-toe over Scattergories at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake post then focuses on how Chelsea Clinton supposedly &quot;used her family foundation&rsquo;s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found <a href=\"http://www.thestreamus.com/breaking-clinton-foundation-ordered-to-cease-operations-chelsea-charged-with-fraud-2/\">several examples</a> <a href=\"http://www.consnation.com/2017/05/clinton-foundation-ordered-cease-operations/\">of this</a> <a href=\"http://washingtonfeed.com/breaking-clinton-foundation-ordered-to-cease-operations-chelsea-charged-with-fraud.html\">story online</a>, most of which appeared to point back to the same <a href=\"http://www.usapoliticstoday.com/clinton-foundation-chelsea-charged-fraud/\">May 3 post at USAPoliticsToday.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only source cited in that story was a <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/11/06/chelsea-clinton-used-foundation-to-help-pay-for-wedding-emails/\">Nov. 6, 2016, article from the <em>New York Post</em>.</a> That article said there was evidence from WikiLeaks&rsquo; hack of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta&rsquo;s emails that Chelsea Clinton had taken money from the foundation to pay in part for her 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Fact Checker had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/04/did-the-clinton-foundation-pay-for-chelseas-wedding/?utm_term=.71f950f705e6\">examined that same claim in January 2017</a>, noting that the <em>New York Post</em> was the only U.S. newspaper to run the story, which was picked up by British tabloids and right-leaning news outlets like Fox News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Despite the breathless reporting, it&rsquo;s hard to tell exactly what is going on in <a href=\"https://www.gop.com/leaked-band-email-chelsea-used-clinton-foundation-resources-for-her-wedding/\">the email exchange</a>, which is dated Jan. 4, 2012,&quot; the <em>Post</em>&rsquo;s Glenn Kessler wrote. &quot;There is no mention of actual Foundation monies being used for the wedding.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chelsea Clinton herself has decried how the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/politics/clinton-foundation-explainer/\">Clinton Foundation has been a target</a> of fake news outlets and conspiracy theorists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The lies were absolutely frustrating because the facts didn&rsquo;t seem sufficient to put them to rest,&quot; she <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/biz/features/chelsea-clinton-activism-sexism-hillary-1202032842/\">told <em>Variety&nbsp;</em>magazine in April</a>. &quot;I think that was so odd about the whole experience &mdash; either the truth was insufficient or people just didn&rsquo;t care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any event, Chelsea Clinton remains free, and the Clinton Foundation is still open for business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-08T22:00:39.207634", "ruling_date": "2017-05-09T12:36:26", "ruling_headline": "Was Chelsea Clinton charged with fraud as Clinton Foundation shut down?
