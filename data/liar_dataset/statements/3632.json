Where&rsquo;s the common ground?&quot; Krugman wrote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKrugman, who sides with the Democrats over Republicans on budget issues, said the Democrats have a winning case to present to the public.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;For what it&rsquo;s worth, polls suggest that the public&rsquo;s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget,&quot; Krugman said. &quot;Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities &mdash; including a majority of Republicans &mdash; also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that&rsquo;s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe decided to check Krugman&rsquo;s numbers on the polls after a reader asked us to look into it.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s take the issues one at a time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>&quot;Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy.&quot;</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDifferent polls phrase the question differently, but the bottom line is the same. We found three recent polls that back up Krugman&rsquo;s point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>&quot;In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose raising taxes on Americans with incomes over 250 thousand dollars a year?&quot; </em>Support: 72 percent.

We should note that these results were released publicly <em>after </em>Krugman&#39;s column appeared. As explained in the <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">Principles of PolitiFact and the Truth-O-Meter</a>, our rulings are based on the information known at the time the person made the remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<em>In order to reduce the budget deficit, it has been proposed that Medicare should be changed from a program in which the government pays doctors and hospitals for treating seniors to a program in which the government helps seniors purchase private health insurance.

April&nbsp; 15-20, 2011.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York Times </em>noted <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/us/22poll.html?ref=todayspaper\">in its story</a> that the response was at odds with other recent polls, and concluded that results may vary depending on how the question was asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Krugman for a comment, he noted that the poll came out after his column was published and that it&#39;s at odds with the other previous polls. &quot;I strongly suspect that the <em>Times</em> result is an outlier -- it looks so different from everything else we&#39;re hearing,&quot; Krugman said via e-mail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that Krugman parenthetically added that a majority of Republicans also opposed major changes to Medicare. We were not able to find party breakdowns for all of these polls, but the ones we did see showed that Republicans opposed changes to Medicare as well. A CBS News Poll from March showed that 67 percent of Republicans were not willing to reduce spending on Medicare. In the <em>USA Today</em>/Gallup poll, 33 percent of Republicans said the government should not try to control the costs of Medicare, with another 28 percent of Republicans said the government should make only minor changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nKrugman said that &quot;large majorities&quot; support support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy, and recent polls support that point. On Medicare, several polls suggest that large majorities, including a majority of Republicans, oppose major changes to the program. One poll, released after Krugman wrote his column, showed an advantage for the Ryan plan. But the preponderance of evidence at the time Krugman made his statement bears him out.
