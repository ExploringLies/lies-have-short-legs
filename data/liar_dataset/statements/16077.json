At the time, Burger King announced that the decision was a &quot;voluntary and precautionary measure&quot; and &quot;not a food safety issue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its story, Everyday Useful Info names &quot;Silvercrest,&quot; as the firm that provided the horse meat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burger King Worldwide on <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/burger-king-worldwide-concludes-investigation-of-silvercrest-foods-189238611.html\">Jan. 31, 2013, issued a press release</a> regarding the Silvercrest scandal. It stated that it had been notified that health officials were investigating Silvercrest&rsquo;s products, which prompted the restaurant chain to conduct its own investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our independent DNA tests results on product taken from BURGER KING&reg; restaurants were negative for any equine DNA,&quot; the press release said. &quot;However, four samples recently taken from the Silvercrest plant have shown the presence of very small trace levels of equine DNA. This product was never sold to our restaurants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burger King said that its investigation established that Silvercrest used &quot;a small percentage of beef imported from a non-approved supplier in Poland. They promised to deliver 100% British &amp; Irish beef patties and have not done so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a clear violation of our specifications, and we have terminated our relationship with them. Through our investigation, we have confirmed that this non-approved Polish supplier is the same company identified by the Irish Department of Agriculture as the source of Silvercrest&#39;s contamination issue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burger King stated that on Jan. 23, 2013, it transitioned all of its UK, Ireland and Denmark suppliers to other suppliers from Germany and Italy: &quot;These suppliers have provided DNA evidence to confirm their products are free of equine DNA. These are the product being sold in our restaurants today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Not once in its statement did Burger King say, as this article in Everyday Useful Info states, that it was using horse meat in its burgers and whoppers. The Everyday Useful Info post blows the 2013 horse meat scare out of proportion, framing the incident as an intentional deception on Burger King&rsquo;s part. The article is similar to other viral claims that have falsely <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/28/blog-posting/fake-news-human-remains-were-not-found-mcdonalds-h/\">alleged that human meat was found in a McDonald&rsquo;s factory</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this article False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-24T14:55:23.649301", "ruling_date": "2018-10-24T15:34:41", "ruling_headline": "Burger King doesn't use horse meat in burgers like viral post claims", "ruling_headline_slug": "burger-king-doesnt-use-horse-meat-burgers-viral-po", "ruling_link_text": "Story distorts a 2013 incident", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Everyday Useful Info, &quot;<a href=\"https://everydayusefulinfo.blogspot.com/2017/10/burger-king-admits-to-using-horse-meat.html?m=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR01UO6r6Frm6rGBdgKN9UNpI3sCi4EvxQpXLNaMf5F2l0FuG5dGF6NKoxU\">BURGER KING ADMITS TO USING HORSE MEAT IN BURGERS, WHOPPERS</a>,&quot; Oct. 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/profile/11136245438404378497\">Alexandra&rsquo;s Blogger profile</a>, accessed Oct. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/01/24/burger-king-horsemeat/1861529/\">Burger King drops supplier linked to horsemeat</a>,&quot; Jan. 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burger King Worldwide press release, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/burger-king-worldwide-concludes-investigation-of-silvercrest-foods-189238611.html\">Burger King Worldwide Concludes Investigation of Silvercrest Foods</a>&quot; Jan. 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guardian, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/31/burger-king-horsemeat\">Burger King reveals its burgers were contaminated in horsemeat scandal</a>,&quot; Jan. 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2013/01/31/news/companies/burger-king-horse-meat/index.html\">Neigh it ain&#39;t so: Burger King finds horse meat at European supplier</a>,&quot; Jan. 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huffington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/31/burger-king-horsemeat-admits-tainted_n_2593538.html\">Burger King Horsemeat Scandal: Chain Admits That Food May Have Been Tainted</a>,&quot; Jan. 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/28/blog-posting/fake-news-human-remains-were-not-found-mcdonalds-h/\">Fake news: Human remains were not found in McDonald&#39;s hamburgers</a>,&quot; Sept. 28, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Burger King admits to using horse meat in burgers, Whoppers.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "", "statement_date": "2017-10-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
