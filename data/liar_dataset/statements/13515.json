His <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MillerForTexas/\">&quot;Miller for Texas&quot;</a> Facebook fan page has more than 330,000 likes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 27, 2016, Miller <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MillerForTexas/photos/a.1430872243801609.1073741828.1427314137490753/1934485643440264/?type=3&amp;theater\">posted a fresh unattributed photo</a>, this time of the muscled actor Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, shown wearing a T-shirt with a message Miller endorsed. Johnson&rsquo;s shirt read: &quot;We stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen,&quot; along with this Miller caption: &quot;Thanks to Dewayne Johnson AKA &quot;The Rock&quot; for standing up and defending our flag. There are a few good guys left in Hollywood and The Rock is one of them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of early December 2016, Miller&rsquo;s Johnson post had drawn 3,500 reactions, 1,092 shares and 111 comments, all supportive, some praising Johnson for being a &quot;stand up guy&quot; who&rsquo;s &quot;not ashamed to admit&quot; his love for country, or telling Johnson &quot;he is The Rock for a reason.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is photo real?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when we saw the photo presentation, it looked to us like the unsourced photo&rsquo;s shirt text had alignment problems. Also, the text on the T-shirt looked skewed and a smudge next to Johnson&rsquo;s right arm looked as if there might have been additional removed text or imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We knew too that Miller had previously posted a photo lacking&nbsp;accuracy. In March 2016, we found <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/mar/25/sid-miller/miller-posts-fake-photo-obama-holding-che-guevara-/\">&quot;Pants on Fire&quot; </a>&nbsp;what turned out to be Miller&rsquo;s Facebook post of a fake image of Barack Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara&rsquo;s face on it. Separately, the Texas Tribune in December 2016 compiled what <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2016/12/03/texas-ag-chiefs-facebook-account-fake-news-flows/?utm_campaign=trib-social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=1480778902\">its story</a> described as 10 Miller posts of &quot;demonstrably false, misleading or unsupported information.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A reverse image search</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started our review of the Johnson photo posted by Miller by conducting a reverse <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=dwayne+the+rock+johnson+2014&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=simg:CAQSmQEJ3ZGd6GHRa2MajQELEKjU2AQaBggBCD0IQgwLELCMpwgaYgpgCAMSKJoQ3hvdG5UbthD1Gt8fmBCXEJQb2CT1OuQt-zqDJfw63S7wLegu-ToaMJUWYjNQnhOlww8mRY_1ATDO1mlFlzUF9tj2XHyW9SwQVIKKmy7uFyJPCNz9w_1iYsAiAEDAsQjq7-CBoKCggIARIEZZEVVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNg73fjNbQAhUJ5YMKHfOlA7AQwg4IGSgA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=845\">Google image search</a> of it. Such a search enables anyone to pull up similar images across the web, demonstrating if other versions&nbsp;have been posted in digital spaces. If multiple versions of a photo exist online, a reverse Google image search can show some of the different iterations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What came back from our search: The same T-shirt and Johnson pose with other slogans displayed, such as &quot;Only elephants should wear ivory&quot; or &quot;Still here, still strong, Native Pride.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"rock-diff tshirts.jpg\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XC5eT-8km10qluWRPGwf9B80lUbW37l1JYTMrkdrimyGstyioxwqjGpp3r1xvpmWSTvjipzcX7mJU5UaQmMqhPqKQ39uAhEBqf7u616lhMNMb-YVXL1i7qBMHGu1YKf92yvg6IKH\" style=\"border:none; height:108px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional results showed Johnson standing in a blank V-neck T-shirt, without any text. And among those, one photo came from the cover of the August 2013 issue of Essence Magazine; that photo shows Johnson wearing a similarly fitting <a href=\"http://www.essence.com/2013/07/02/dwayne-rock-johnson-graces-august-cover-essence\">navy blue V-neck T-shirt</a>, without any text on the shirt. Then again,&nbsp;Johnson holds a different pose and presents a&nbsp;different facial expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other results--on websites such as <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/ags831/dwayne-johnson/\">Pinterest</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mid-day.com/articles/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-gifts-housekeeper-new-car/15040007\">Mid-day.com</a>, an Indian news and lifestyle website--showed what looked to us like a blank T-shirt version of the Miller-posted photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"essence photo.jpg\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZwlBTOCGs_UV50JONUtQNkDV0CZ2GTkrETXQkL30TYuFLko37O_L-m6z4M3AwIju1u2HtftqC_qA3KCD1Q07r3DJnsHX4k6IGRi1nqgmYmvYrXErCgmMsg_wykG5EzVdi5woUzoV\" style=\"border:none; height:279px; width:216px\" /><img alt=\"22Dwayne-Johnson.jpg\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ceBHC4599vGskvoAqfZntDTUebx0Nm9vwPqMUWS145Mm69N2ywXc49vFeDFalEfF-ftl9H14N_La4Qs00--EWS4GupXtIudPiY4Wkt-t8o08ck1ensw_sdCgUNpBKclvyUoJK5Q_\" style=\"border:none; height:249px; width:245px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Miller spokesman calls inquiry &#39;silly&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what gives?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to a Miller campaign spokesman, Todd Smith, to find out where Miller picked up his Facebook-posted photo. Smith said he personally &quot;had no clue&quot; and said ours was a &quot;silly, silly inquiry.&quot; He said the message of the T-shirt is what counts. When asked what his comment would be if the photo itself was fake, he said he hadn&rsquo;t heard complaints from Johnson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Johnson representative says Miller photo &#39;photoshopped&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we endeavored to reach someone familiar with Johnson&rsquo;s photo history. After calling Johnson&rsquo;s public relations team, we heard from Britt Johnson with the Garcia Companies, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/britt-johnson-3699b812?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=yRLj&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=322988931480976438908&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=4&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A322988931480976438908%2CVSRPtargetId%3A44285697%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH\">who identifies herself</a> as a social media spokesperson for Johnson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britt Johnson said by email: &quot;While I can&#39;t recall where that photo was taken, I can say with confidence that the image/shirt&quot; shared by Miller &quot;was photoshopped.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Forensic photography expert</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, a web search led us to a forensic photography expert at the <a href=\"http://forensics.syr.edu/\">Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute</a> at Syracuse University. By email, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://asfaculty.syr.edu/pages/forensics/lahm_cathryn.html\">Cathryn Lahm</a> responded that what she looked at after downloading a copy of the photo we&rsquo;d shared from Miller&rsquo;s Facebook post and viewing the photo in her software program, &quot;the T-shirt The Rock is wearing is most likely &lsquo;plain&rsquo; and the graphics were placed on the photo -- made to look -- like it was actually on his shirt,&quot; referring to the pro-flag message. She said the artist likely applied the graphic design onto an existing image, so Johnson would look like he was wearing the presented T-shirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The original image was shot at some press event -- I think -- based on the &lsquo;hot flash shadows&rsquo; as if he is walking the red carpet for some opening of a movie or an event,&quot; Lahm said. If she &quot;had to go to court&quot; about the authenticity of the Miller-posted photo, Lahm said, she would call the image a fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miller posted a photo of &quot;The Rock&quot; wearing a T-shirt with a message calling for people to &quot;stand for the flag and kneel for the fallen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That image, we found, was a product of photo manipulation. It looks to us like Johnson actually&nbsp;posed in a plain shirt without any message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this photo&nbsp;post False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>FALSE </strong></em>&ndash; The statement is not accurate.
