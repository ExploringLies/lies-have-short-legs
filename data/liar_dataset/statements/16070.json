Trump said they did at a <a href=\"https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-lebanon-oh-october-12-2018\">rally in Lebanon, Ohio, on Oct. 12</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said, &quot;I&#39;ll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress &mdash; thanks to (Ohio Republican Sen.) Rob Portman and a lot of others &mdash; thank you, Rob &mdash; but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was this a mostly Republican-backed bill?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not at all. In fact, it garnered as close as you can come to universal support in this politically polarized era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill offered such <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+6%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1\">provisions</a> as barring fentanyl from being imported by mail, expanding the ability of nurses to prescribe medication to counter opioid addiction, and enhanced access to treatment for Medicaid recipients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+6%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1\">originally introduced</a> in June by several House Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats included Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Tim Walz of Minnesota.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial version passed the House by a <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll288.xml\">396-14</a> margin and the equivalent version passed the Senate by a <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00210\">99-1</a> margin.
