America&rsquo;s real pastime is an economic behemoth that can&rsquo;t be stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Last week&rsquo;s three most-viewed television programs were <em>Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football</em> and <em>Monday Night Football,</em>&quot; he said. &quot;And money talks and it will continue to talk. And this will pass over, and football will go on its merry way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that professional football has a big TV audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know just how big.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>By the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To check Will&rsquo;s claim we looked to a <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/content/corporate/us/en/top10s.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>t</u><u>op-10 ranking</u></a> of shows by the Nielsen Company, which tracks consumer trends, including television viewership, from the week of Monday, Sept. 8, through Sunday, Sept. 14. It is the most-recent week available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/09/us/ray-rice-timeline/\">That Monday</a>, TMZ released a video showing Rice punching his now-wife in an elevator. On the same day, the Baltimore Ravens terminated their contract with Rice, and Goodell announced that Rice was on indefinite suspension. Later in the week, the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/ap-newsbreak-source-rice-video-nfl-25414917\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Associated Press reported</u></a> that NFL executives were supposedly aware of this video months earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nielsen has separate top-10 lists for broadcast television and cable television. Because <em>Monday Night Football</em> appears on ESPN, we decided to combine the lists into one overall ranking. Here are the top 10 shows and their viewership (in millions) that week:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">1. NBC <em>Sunday Night Football</em> (22.1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">2. CBS <em>Thursday Night Football</em> (20.8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">3. NBC <em>Sunday Night NFL Pre-Kick show</em> (16.7)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">4. CBS <em>NFL</em> <em>Thursday Night Pre-Kick show</em> (13.9)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">5. ESPN <em>Monday Night Football </em>- New York/Detroit (13.7)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">6. CBS&nbsp;<em>60 Minutes</em> (12.3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">7. NBC <em>Football Night in America </em>(12.4)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">8. ESPN <em>Monday Night Football </em>- San Diego/Arizona (11.5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">9. CBS <em>NFL</em> <em>Thursday Night Kickoff</em> (10.6)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">10. CBS <em>America&rsquo;s Got Talent</em> (10.5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, there&rsquo;s a lot of love for professional football. Americans don&rsquo;t just love the games -- they love the pregame shows, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The popularity of the pregame shows on NBC and CBS pushed the<em> Monday Night Football</em> game between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions to No. 5. So Will&rsquo;s comment, by Nielsen&rsquo;s metrics, is a tad off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the point holds: Pro football games and pre- and post-game analysis dominated 8 out of 10 of the top 10 shows. Only CBS&rsquo; <em>America&rsquo;s Got Talent</em> and <em>60 Minutes </em>cracked the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, excitement for NFL games is high since the season started just a couple weeks ago, and the networks&rsquo; fall television programming hasn&rsquo;t fully kicked in just yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, NFL games and analysis will continue to dominate the rankings as the season goes on, said Marc Berman, <a href=\"http://www.tvmediainsights.com/author/marcberman/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>editor-in-chief of TV Media Insights</u></a>, in an interview with PunditFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When new shows begin to air, the number of &quot;households using television&quot; goes up, but they don&rsquo;t take viewers away from football, Berman said. The popularity of the teams playing and whether the game is exciting have a bigger effect on football viewership ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous Nielsen statistics show professional football&rsquo;s seemingly permanent first-place spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2013-14 season, NBC&rsquo;s<em> Sunday Night Football </em>was the <a href=\"http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/22/nbcs-sunday-night-football-is-primetime-televisions-1-show-for-third-consecutive-season/266704/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most-watched</u></a> primetime show, with 21.7 million average viewers. ESPN&rsquo;s <em>Monday Night Football</em> was the No. 1 most-viewed cable television show in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NFL holds <a href=\"http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/08/nfl-2013-tv-recap-205-million-fans-tuned-in-34-of-35-most-watched-shows-this-fall/227726/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>34 of the 35 most-watched individual shows</u></a> in the fall of 2013. (The odd one out was NBC&rsquo;s Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Parade at No. 22.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in four of the past five years, the Super Bowl has <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/10398603/super-bowl-xlviii-telecast-most-watched-tv-event-us-history\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>broken the record</u></a> for the most-watched television event in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional football stands out from other sports, said Dan Lebowitz, executive director of Northeastern University&rsquo;s Center for the Study of Sports and Society. In football, there are only 16 games in a typical season -- as opposed to baseball&rsquo;s 162 games and basketball&rsquo;s 82 games -- so each game becomes a major event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rise of fantasy football has further solidified the sport&rsquo;s popularity, Lebowitz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scandals involving Rice and other NFL standouts&nbsp;can&rsquo;t make even a small dent in this trend because of football&rsquo;s widespread popularity and importance in American culture, Berman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Football will outlive all of us,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will said, &quot;Last week&rsquo;s three most-viewed television programs were <em>Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football </em>and<em> Monday Night Football</em>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Football games and related programming accounted for eight of the top 10 most-viewed TV programs between Sept. 8-14, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though <em>Monday Night Football</em> came in fifth, not third, Will was right to say that football dominated the rankings. Experts say it will continue to do just that.
