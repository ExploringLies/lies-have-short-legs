Norway and Switzerland followed at $4,579 and $4,568, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States maintained its spending lead in the years that followed. But Sanders puts the difference too strongly when he says U.S. spending is &quot;almost twice&quot; per capita of &quot;any other country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the OECD&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most recent data</u></a>, U.S. spending grew to $8,713 per capita in 2013. Switzerland and Norway came in second and third at $6,325 and $5,862 per capita, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The organization&rsquo;s incomplete 2014 data set, which does not include the United States, shows no country spending over $6,500 per capita.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had Sanders fine-tuned his talking point by claiming that the United States spends twice as much per capita as the <em>average</em> developed country, his statement would been accurate. Average per capita spending is less than $3,500 across the 32 countries listed in the OECD database.

Sanders&rsquo; comment suggests the United States outpaces all other countries more than it actually does.
