Clinton said June 22 (the interview appeared online July 11). &quot;Immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s statement on immigrant-owned businesses interested us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are immigrants really better than native-born Americans at starting &mdash; and growing &mdash; successful businesses?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the data shows </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed us to analysis from the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation that shows immigrants are almost &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/resources/entrepreneurship-policy-digest/immigrant-entrepreneurs-a-path-to-us-economic-growth\">twice as likely</a>&quot; to start businesses than natives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation looked at monthly data from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey from 1996 through 2014 and estimated that immigrants have a new entrepreneur rate <a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/2015/05/kauffman_index_startup_activity_national_trends_2015.pdf\">of 52 percent</a> compared to the native born rate of 27 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their analysis also addressed the success of these businesses, but only within a certain subset - venture-backed firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immigrant founders from these companies have created about 150 jobs per company in the United States. According to the foundation, in 2011, 24 of the top 50 venture-backed businesses also had a least one foreign-born founder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we spoke with generally agreed with Clinton&rsquo;s claim. Although, there are some caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of California, Santa Cruz economics professor Robert Fairlie, who <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs396tot.pdf\">authored a 2012 paper</a> for the Small Business Administration on immigrant entrepreneurs, said that the success of these businesses is not as clear as the start-up data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My estimates show that immigrants have a much higher business start rate than non-immigrants,&quot; Fairlie said. &quot;There is also evidence showing that immigrant businesses are smaller on average than non-immigrant businesses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2011 report from the bipartisan Partnership for a New American Economy notes that <a href=\"http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf\">40 percent of Fortune 500 companies</a> are founded by an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. Although, when the former CEO of AOL repeated this claim, we rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/06/steve-case/steve-case-says-40-percent-fortune-500-were-starte/\">Half True</a> -- a company&rsquo;s dominance could be more attributable to recent leaders more so than its founders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Clinton&rsquo;s claim was not as definitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Immigrants are indeed more likely than others to be business owners,&quot; said David Kallick, a senior fellow at the Fiscal Policy Institute. &quot;The claims about business ownership are sometimes overstated, but from the Vox quote, I&rsquo;d say Hillary is on the mark.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration policies, analyzed the Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2015 Current Population Survey self-employment data by country for immigrants and natives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He found that immigrants from some countries, such as Brazil and Germany, do have higher business ownership rates than natives. But immigrants from other countries do not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camarota said it is possible they start businesses at higher rates than natives, but &quot;they fail at higher rates, too.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, Colgate University economics professor Chad Sparber, an immigration economy expert, said Clinton&rsquo;s claim is accurate, noting that <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2016/self-employment-in-the-united-states/pdf/self-employment-in-the-united-states.pdf\">federal data</a> shows that immigrants are &quot;almost always more likely&quot; to be self-employed than natives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Though, self-employment isn&rsquo;t necessarily the same thing as starting a business,&quot; Sparber said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal data and the experts we spoke with back up her claim. While it&rsquo;s important to note that evidence on the success of immigrant-owned businesses is limited, what we did find supports what Clinton said, that immigrants &quot;seem&quot; to grow their businesses better than their native counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Clinton&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e394b49-c56d-49c0-8cc7-46eb68e4e919\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e394b49-c56d-49c0-8cc7-46eb68e4e919</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-27T14:47:41.271152", "ruling_date": "2016-07-27T18:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton claims immigrants are more successful at owning businesses than natives", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-claims-immigrants-are-more-success", "ruling_link_text": "On the mark, but success hard to measure", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Vox, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview#immigration-economy\">The Vox Conversation, Hillary Clinton</a>,&quot; July 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kauffman Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/resources/entrepreneurship-policy-digest/immigrant-entrepreneurs-a-path-to-us-economic-growth\">Immigrant entrepreneurs: A path to U.S. economic growth</a>,&quot; Jan. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kauffman Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/2015/05/kauffman_index_startup_activity_national_trends_2015.pdf\">2015 The Kauffman Index: Startup Activity</a>,&quot; accessed July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small Business Administration, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs396tot.pdf\">Immigrant entrepreneurs and small business owners, and their access to financial capital</a>,&quot; accessed July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnership for a New American Economy, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf\">The &lsquo;New American&rsquo; Fortune 500</a>,&quot; accessed July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/06/steve-case/steve-case-says-40-percent-fortune-500-were-starte/\">Steve Case says 40 percent of the Fortune 500 were started either by immigrants or children of immigrants</a>,&quot; July 6, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2016/self-employment-in-the-united-states/pdf/self-employment-in-the-united-states.pdf\">Self-employment in the United States</a>,&quot; accessed July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, July 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with University of California, Santa Cruz economics professor Robert Fairlie, July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Fiscal Policy Institute senior fellow David Kallick, July 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Center for Immigration Studies director of research Steven Camarota, July 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Colgate University economics professor Chad Sparber, July 21, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview with Vox", "statement_date": "2016-06-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
