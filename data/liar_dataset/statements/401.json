McSame as Bush.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Universal health care has been much debated in the Democratic primary campaign, but hardly mentioned on the Republican side. The consensus among health care experts is that to achieve universal health care &mdash; the intention to cover every person with no exceptions &mdash; there must be a legal requirement for care, such as\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/dec/03/clinton-and-obamas-dueling-health-plans/\">\n  a mandate for individuals to buy insurance\n </a>\n .

Barack Obama opposes it\n </a>\n on the grounds that its implementation could penalize the working poor.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bush does not support any sort of health care mandate, nor does McCain.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"On health care we trust patients to make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.,\" Bush said on March 13, 2008, at a Republican Congresional Committee dinner.\n</p>\n<p>\n At a health care forum on Oct. 31, 2007, hosted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, McCain said he opposed mandates, even while discussing plans to improve access to health care.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I don't think that there should be a mandate for every American to have health insurance.
