Initially, that bill cuts taxes for all income groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what DeWine omits: That tax bill did not cut everyone&rsquo;s taxes, particularly in future years. And Cordray, who as governor would have no power to raise federal taxes, hasn&rsquo;t said he wants to raise taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Cordray&rsquo;s statements about federal taxes</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The video states that Cordray wants to reverse Trump&rsquo;s tax reform, but the first thing to know is that if he won the race, a governor can&rsquo;t control federal tax policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the video doesn&rsquo;t tell the full story about that $2,000 tax cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax bill doesn&rsquo;t cut everyone&rsquo;s taxes, especially for people in future years. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1424/cut-taxes-everyone/\">At its start</a> the tax bill does come close to providing tax relief for all income groups, and for most members within each group. The median household of a family of four gets about a $2,000 tax cut on average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the benefits of the tax bill would <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/19/who-wins-and-who-loses-tax-bill/\">flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time these broad-based tax cuts dissipate. By 2027, every income group below $75,000 sees a tax increase. Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027. That&rsquo;s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DeWine campaign cited <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeB4sqBdpMSpz4F8ttmoaY5kMEqpvTC0cLelfuYEu8w/edit\">several statements by Cordray</a> in which he criticized the federal tax bill as a benefit to the rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1424/cut-taxes-everyone/\">speech to the City Club of Cleveland</a> in December, Cordray said that the legislation helped corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s slabs for them, there&rsquo;s crumbs for people like the middle-class people in our society,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it is wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Dec. 20 tweet, Cordray called the bill a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richcordray/status/943551670918811654?s=21\">&quot;shortsighted abomination.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichCordray/status/960536131375894528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E960536131375894528&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cincinnati.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2018%2F02%2F05%2Fsocial-media-reacts-trumps-visit-cincinnati%2F307023002%2F\">Cordray tweeted</a> that the tax bill brings &quot;more trickle-down economics that doesn&rsquo;t trickle down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray has echoed a talking point by Democrats that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/16/democratic-national-committee/dnc-offers-one-sided-view-who-gets-tax-bills-benef/\">cherrypicks the impact of the tax bill</a>. The tax bill gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent by 2027 due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t find any statements by Cordray weighing in on any specific proposal to replace the tax bill. We asked Cordray&rsquo;s spokeswoman what he wants to see happen with federal tax policy and if he wants to raise or lower taxes for any particular group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Rich wants to see a federal tax plan in place that doesn&rsquo;t hurt middle class families,&quot; his campaign spokeswoman Lacey Rose said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Congress later changes the federal tax law, it could raise taxes on some people -- but it could also lower taxes on others. And even if such a bill were to gain traction, as a governor Cordray would have no say.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Cordray&rsquo;s statements on state taxes</div>\r\n\r\n<p>DeWine&rsquo;s video focuses on federal taxes, but we will briefly note Cordray&rsquo;s position on state taxes because that is something in the power of a governor. We found that Cordray has been critical of state tax cuts and has called for certain tax incentives for businesses, but has been vague on the details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clearest example we found in which he opposed tax increases was a May article by the <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/guns-minimum-wage-top-issues-ohio-democratic-governor-primary/OHTxqymbGDdbwVy8gIM4dJ/\">Dayton Daily News</a> which paraphrased Cordray saying he didn&rsquo;t see a need for tax increases. Cordray said he wanted to prioritize state spending, including less for failing charter schools and more for local government to deal with the opioid crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has criticized state tax cuts because that has trickled down to local governments facing choices about whether to raise their own taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a gathering of <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/4/17/1757900/-OH-Gov-Richard-Cordray-D-Throws-Down-The-Populist-Gauntlet-At-GOP-s-Mania-For-Tax-Cuts\">union leaders and local government workers</a> in April, Cordray slammed Republicans&rsquo; &quot;mania&quot; for cutting taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He vowed that as governor, &quot;if the legislature continues down its current path of tax and budget cuts, there will be vetoes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>DeWine said that &quot;Richard Cordray wants to raise your taxes by reversing President Trump&#39;s tax reform.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Cordray has repeatedly bashed the federal tax bill, DeWine ignores that the bill didn&rsquo;t cut everyone&rsquo;s taxes, particularly in future years, and that repealing the bill, which could include a replacement, could end up cutting taxes for some families. While Cordray has made it clear that he criticizes the bill for helping the rich, he hasn&rsquo;t laid out any specific suggestion for changing the federal tax law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, if Cordray wins the governorship, he would not have a vote on federal tax policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-19T09:44:52.111599", "ruling_date": "2018-07-24T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "In Ohio, Mike DeWine misleads in video that says Richard Cordray wants to raise taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-mike-dewine-misleads-video-says-richard-cordr", "ruling_link_text": "A big critic of Trump tax reform", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mike DeWine campaign, <a href=\"https://canttrustcordray.com/\">Can&rsquo;t Trust Cordray website</a>, Accessed July 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Cordray, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QeB4sqBdpMSpz4F8ttmoaY5kMEqpvTC0cLelfuYEu8w/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs\">Tweets about taxes</a>, 2018 campaign</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Ways and Means Committee, By the Numbers: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Delivers Tax Cuts for Families in Every Congressional District</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, <a href=\"https://itep.org/tcja20182026/\">&quot;Extensions of the New Tax Law&rsquo;s Temporary Provisions Would Mainly Benefit the Wealthy,&quot; </a>April 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking Points Memo, <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/cordray-strikes-populist-tone-on-tax-day-as-ohio-gov-race-heats-up\">&quot;Cordray Strikes Populist Tone On Tax Day As Ohio Gov Race Heats Up,&quot;</a> April 17th, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dayton Daily News, <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/guns-minimum-wage-top-issues-ohio-democratic-governor-primary/OHTxqymbGDdbwVy8gIM4dJ/\">&quot;Guns, minimum wage top issues in Ohio Democratic governor primary,&quot;</a> May 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dayton Daily News, &quot;Cordray: Ohio must be strategic on schools;&quot; Feb. 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg TV, Richard Cordray interview, Feb. 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Repository (Canton, Ohio), &quot;Cordray makes campaign stop in Canton,&quot; Dec. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cincinnati Enquirer, &quot;What would they do as governor?
