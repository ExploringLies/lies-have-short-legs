Dianne Feinstein says so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeinstein, chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, chatted with <em>Hardball </em>host Chris Matthews the day after Sen. Rand Paul&rsquo;s 13-hour <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/07/rand-paul/sen-rand-paul-says-obama-advocating-drone-strike-p/\">filibuster over U.S. drone policy.</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaul was concerned about <a href=\"http://paul.senate.gov/files/documents/BrennanHolderResponse.pdf\">a March 4, 2013, letter</a> from the attorney general that didn&rsquo;t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil. A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/611986-letter-from-attorney-general-eric-holder-to-sen.html\">new letter</a> satisfied his curiosity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut his March 6 &quot;drone rant,&quot; as the<em> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324128504578344700320290068.html\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> called it, raised criticism from lawmakers, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., &nbsp;and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn MSNBC, Matthews asked Feinstein: Was Rand &quot;playing to the paranoia in people&quot;?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeinstein replied that armed drones are a &quot;new technology&quot; and a &quot;very dangerous weapon,&quot; that she wants to keep out of the hands of other nations. Then she said:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>&quot;We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use. You can see drones some day hovering over the homes of Hollywood luminaries, violating privacy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This question has to be addressed. And we need rules of operation on the border, by police, by commercial use, and also by military and intelligence use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;So this is now a work in progress. We are taking a look at it on the Intelligence Committee, trying to draft some legislation. The administration is looking at a rules playbook as to how these won&#39;t be used and how they will be used.&quot;</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout armed drones, we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/07/rand-paul/sen-rand-paul-says-obama-advocating-drone-strike-p/\">heard plenty</a> in recent days, thanks to Paul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Feinstein&rsquo;s privacy claim caught our eye. Do &quot;we have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use&quot;?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The FAA</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe gave Feinstein&rsquo;s office a day or two to explain her comments, but her staff didn&rsquo;t offer an on-the-record response.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we chatted with experts on drones, also known as &quot;unmanned aircraft systems,&quot; and read up on Federal Aviation Administration rules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat&rsquo;s right &mdash; there are FAA rules. Do they address &quot;commercial use&quot; of drones?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=14153\">only way</a> for folks who don&rsquo;t work in government to get FAA approval to fly a drone in U.S. airspace is to get something called an &quot;experimental airworthiness certificate.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the FAA <a href=\"http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/uas_faq/\">doesn&rsquo;t give them out</a> for commercial use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The FAA&#39;s rules &mdash; once you can find them &mdash; are pretty clear: You cannot use a drone for a commercial purpose without a permit,&quot; said Matt Waite, who founded the <a href=\"http://www.dronejournalismlab.org/about\">Drone Journalism Lab</a> at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;And, the FAA has made it pretty clear that those permits are really only for research and development and in very limited circumstances,&quot; he added. &quot;So, it amounts to a total ban on commercial (use).&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaite would know: &nbsp;Students and faculty in his lab &quot;research the ethical, legal and regulatory issues involved in using pilotless aircraft to do journalism.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd even he hasn&rsquo;t yet been able to score an FAA certificate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFull disclosure: Before Waite joined the University of Nebraska in 2011 to teach reporting and digital product development, he was an employee of the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> who helped create PolitiFact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.auvsi.org/home/aboutus/\">Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International</a>, a nonprofit group that represents members interested in promoting drone technology, also told us that Feinstein was mistaken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There are a number of regulations on commercial flights of unmanned systems,&quot; said Melanie Hinton, a spokeswoman for the group.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot only that, Hinton said, but currently, that includes &quot;no commercial use.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat looks to us like the opposite of what Feinstein said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, Feinstein has a point about privacy, said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington and author of the article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/drone-privacy-catalyst\">The Drone as Privacy Catalyst</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe notes federal privacy laws haven&rsquo;t kept pace with drone technology, and that while the FAA currently bans commercial use of drones, Congress has asked for new regulations for civilian drones by 2015.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLawmakers want to &quot;safely accelerate&quot; the use of such drones, according to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, a <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.658:\">piece of legislation</a> that <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00015\">Feinstein supported</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;In this respect, she is correct,&quot; Calo said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, the agency has said it will address concerns about privacy as it develops a new regulatory framework. It&rsquo;s just not yet clear whether the new rules will satisfy <a href=\"http://epic.org/privacy/drones/\">privacy advocates</a>. That&rsquo;s because it&#39;s still in the middle of rulemaking, and plans <a href=\"https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm/announcement/view/13143\">more public outreach</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center, for example, <a href=\"http://epic.org/privacy/drones/FAA-553e-Petition-03-08-12.pdf\">petitioned the FAA</a> to take privacy into account as it drafts its rules. The <a href=\"https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm/announcement/view/13143\">FAA agreed</a>, saying the month before Feinstein&rsquo;s comment that it &quot;intends to address these issues through engagement and collaboration with the public.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But final privacy requirements are still under development.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeinstein said, &quot;We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use.&quot; Feinstein&rsquo;s wrong: Not only does the FAA regulate the commercial use of drones, it actually bans it. Still, the landscape is changing. At Congress&rsquo; direction, the FAA is drafting new regulations. How those rules will address privacy concerns, it&#39;s too soon to tell. But it&#39;s inaccurate to say there&rsquo;s &quot;no regulation.&quot; We rate her statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-11T14:38:55.733349", "ruling_date": "2013-03-11T16:37:09", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
