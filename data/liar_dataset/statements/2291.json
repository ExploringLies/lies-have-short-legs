But here is what he doesn&#39;t want you to know,&quot; a narrator says, as the video first cuts to an image of a safe, then a second image of Atwater and a bank.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Jeff Atwater was an executive vice president at Riverside National Bank, which was rated one of the seven weakest banks in all of Florida. In fact, Atwater&#39;s bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But not before Atwater&#39;s bank cost the FDIC $491 million dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen the video cuts back to the image of the safe, then the Atwater portrait.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;So ask yourself, can Florida really afford Jeff Atwater as our next CFO?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe ad produced this reaction from Atwater&#39;s campaign:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;In another sign that her stagnant campaign is completely devoid of a positive vision for Florida, liberal Loranne Ausley has launched a mudslinging attack on the web that lies about Jeff Atwater&#39;s professional experience,&quot; Atwater spokesman Brian Hughes said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLies? In a political campaign? Could it be?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida wanted to get to the bottom of this.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor the purpose of this fact-check, we&#39;re focusing on this statement: &quot;Atwater&#39;s bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst, let&#39;s establish Atwater&#39;s role and time at Riverside.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Atwater&#39;s background at Riverside</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtwater, of North Palm Beach, oversaw business development at Riverside Bank&#39;s Palm Beach County branches from 2002 to February 2009. When he left the bank, it had more than 60 branches and more than 1,000 employees in Florida.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAtwater told PolitiFact Florida he left the bank to focus on his responsibilities as Senate President.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn newspaper articles, Atwater <a href=\"http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/palmbeach/realestate/entries/2008/10/07/bankers_safest_place_for_your.html\" id=\"d:su\" title=\"has been listed as Palm Beach County president\">had been listed as Palm Beach County president</a> of Riverside National Bank.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut a bank spokeswoman told the <i>Palm Beach Post </i>that Atwater functioned as a &quot;regional business development manager&quot; at the bank&#39;s Palm Beach County branches. Atwater&#39;s 2008 pay from Riverside was $199,833 and he listed his title as &quot;EVP&quot; on his 2009 financial disclosure statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAtwater spokesman Hughes says that stands for executive vice president.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The reality is it&#39;s a local community bank, one in which his title was vice president,&quot; Hughes said. &quot;But his day-to-day responsibility was almost that of a regional branch manger. He worked with a few local branches.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Atwater was definitely a manager at the bank, and likely one of its higher-paid executives. He was not a member of the board of directors, however, and maintains he had no direct say in the bank&#39;s loan-making process.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Bank finds itself in trouble</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn May 27, 2009 -- about three months after Atwater left Riverside -- <a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/venture/2009/05/wake-up-and-good-morning-xxxx-3.html\" id=\"rka6\" title=\"the bank was one of seven in Florida\">the bank was one of seven in Florida</a> that failed to hold the amount of money required by regulators, according to the <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the<i> Palm Beach Post</i> reported on May 29 that Riverside was ranked among the weakest in the nation, <a href=\"http://www.postonpolitics.com/2009/05/atwaters-former-bank-among-list-of-states-weakest/#more-7050\" id=\"c4uc\" title=\"according to TheStreet.com\">according to TheStreet.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFast forward to April 16, 2010, almost a year later.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://fdic.gov/news/news/press/2010/pr10078.html\" title=\"The FDIC announced\">The FDIC announced</a> that it was closing Riverside National Bank and that TD Bank was taking over its accounts. Riverside, and two other Florida banks, were closed in order &quot;to protect depositors,&quot; according to the FDIC.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn its announcement, the FDIC said the cost to the FDIC&#39;s insurance fund to guarantee the bank&#39;s obligations was $491.8 million.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <i>Post </i>documented the bank&#39;s closure this way:</p>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tFORT PIERCE &mdash; Beset by steep losses and unable to raise much-needed capital, Riverside National Bank was closed by federal regulators Friday.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIts business was taken over by TD Bank, the U.S. arm of Toronto-Dominion Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Riverside&#39;s failure is expected to cost the FDIC&rsquo;s Deposit Insurance Fund $492 million.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tRiverside, a stalwart of St. Lucie County&rsquo;s business community, was the second-largest of the 25 Florida banks shuttered by the FDIC since August 2008.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tRiverside had 58 offices from Palm Beach County to Volusia County. Its $3.4 billion in assets made it the seventh-&shy;largest bank headquartered in Florida.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tRiverside posted huge losses in the past two years, including red ink of $138.9 million in 2008 and $131 million in 2009.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t&quot;This was a dead bank walking,&quot; said Miami banking analyst Ken Thomas. &quot;The question is why has the FDIC let them flail away for so long.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe article noted that Riverside was hit hard by the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, rendering Riverside&#39;s securities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac worthless. Loan losses escalated. Atwater isn&#39;t mentioned in the story.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Back to the ad</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAusley&#39;s ad makes three basic claims.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst, that Atwater worked as an executive at Riverside National Bank. That&#39;s true.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSecond, that the bank was rated one of the weakest in Florida. That&#39;s true.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd third, that Riverside eventually was shut down by federal regulators. Also true.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the problem is the 30-second spot splices together those three events like they happened within weeks of each other, when really they were separated by 14 months.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhy is that important to know? Because Atwater was no longer working at Riverside when the bank was either rated weak, or shut down. That alone doesn&#39;t mean Atwater can&#39;t be culpable. And we imagine he had to at least be aware of the bank&#39;s financial problems, considering it posted a $138.9 million loss in 2008. But the ad&#39;s references to &quot;Atwater&#39;s bank&quot; are misleading, because it&#39;s more accurately described as &quot;Atwater&#39;s former bank.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNaturally, the question of culpability is harder to determine -- and one we&#39;re not ruling on.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe can, however, rule on the specific claim in Ausley&#39;s ad. She said, &quot;Atwater&#39;s bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the FDIC.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt the time, it wasn&#39;t Atwater&#39;s bank. It may have been his former bank, or best yet, it was a bank where he used to work as an executive vice president. For the misleading timeline, we find the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-27T13:05:50.854089", "ruling_date": "2010-08-27T15:44:34", "ruling_headline": "Loranne Ausley attacks Jeff Atwater's banking ties in a new web ad", "ruling_headline_slug": "loranne-ausley-attacks-jeff-atwaters-banking-ties-", "ruling_link_text": "Atwater left 14 months before FDIC stepped in", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tLoranne Ausley campaign, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJWmquG1lPg&amp;feature=player_embedded\" id=\"huas\" title=\"Can Florida Afford Jeff Atwater?\">Can Florida Afford Jeff Atwater?</a>&quot;
