At the Fox Business Network GOP debate in Milwaukee, Rubio made a pitch for young Americans to put down the textbooks and pick up a blowtorch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the life of me, I don&rsquo;t know why we have stigmatized vocational training,&quot; Rubio <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/10/politics/republican-debate-marco-rubio-welders-philosophers/index.html\">said</a>. &quot;Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a big moment for Rubio, but was he correct? Philosophically and statistically speaking, no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly how many philosophers there are in America, as many don&rsquo;t have the title &quot;philosopher&quot; in their <a href=\"https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/where-can-philosophy-take-me\">job descriptions</a>. For this fact-check, we will look at those who majored in philosophy in college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors?page=22\">Payscale</a>, a company that collects salary information, philosophy majors make an average first-year salary of $42,200. The average mid-career pay for philosophy majors is even better: $85,000 per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the median pay for philosophy professors is nearly $90,000 per year, according to <a href=\"http://www1.salary.com/Professor-Philosophy-Salary.html\">salary.com</a>. The top 10 percent of philosophy professors make more than $190,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio will be hard-pressed to find a welder who makes a comparable salary. According to the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes514121.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the median wage for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers is $37,420 -- about $18 an hour. The top 10 percent of welders earn $58,590 or more. That&rsquo;s significantly less than the top 10 percent of philosophy professors, who earn $190,000 or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t heard back from the Rubio campaign yet, but it&rsquo;s possible that Rubio read something along the lines of this <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303663604579501801872226532\">2014 Wall Street Journal column</a>, which cites a few cases in which welders bring home annual salaries exceeding $150,000. While this might be the case for some extremely high-level welders -- just as some philosophy professors make significantly more money than others -- the labor and salary data suggests these cases are the exception, not the norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said, &quot;Welders make more money than philosophers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It made for a great sound bite, but neither salary nor labor statistics back up Rubio&rsquo;s claim. Statistically, philosophy majors make more money than welders -- with much more room to significantly increase pay throughout their careers. It&rsquo;s clear that Rubio was making a pitch for more vocational training in the United States, but his claim on welders doesn&#39;t hold together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Aristotle said, &quot;The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold.&quot; We rate Rubio&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-11T13:31:02.476128", "ruling_date": "2015-11-11T13:51:14", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio said wrongly that welders make more money than philosophers", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-welders-more-money-philosophers", "ruling_link_text": "Not in this universe", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/10/politics/republican-debate-marco-rubio-welders-philosophers/index.html\">Marco Rubio&rsquo;s quip about welders gets torched</a>,&quot; Nov. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes514121.htm\">Occupational Employment and Wages: Welders, Cutters, Solderers and Brazers</a>, May 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303663604579501801872226532\">Welders Make $150,000?
