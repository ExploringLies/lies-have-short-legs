Sean Duffy, a Republican, referred to the &quot;progressive, liberal, communist community of Madison&quot; while discussing how Dane County opted for a hand tally during the presidential recount. The comments came in a December appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepSeanDuffy/status/806611646055665671\">implied on Twitter</a> he was joking, but Pocan wasn&rsquo;t laughing. The Democrat went on the same show Dec. 8, 2016, to demand an apology and defend the state&rsquo;s capital city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the last decade, 73 percent of new jobs (in Wisconsin) have come from Madison,&quot; Pocan said in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNY9Uv_GudA\">appearance</a>. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s exactly the way I look at communists. We actually have a very vibrant private sector.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is one Wisconsin city really responsible for nearly three-fourths of the job growth over the last 10 years? Let&#39;s check the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Problems with geography, specificity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim runs into immediate trouble since Pocan referred to the wrong geographic area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spokesman David Kolovson said Pocan meant to say Dane County was responsible for 73% of jobs, not Madison. He noted two<a href=\"https://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-pocan-calls-out-rep-duffy-for-saying-madison-is-a-communist\"> news</a><a href=\"https://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-pocan-sets-the-facts-straight-with-rep-duffy-after-he-refuses-to\"> releases</a> Pocan issued on the topic attributed that number to Dane County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slightly more than half of Dane County lives outside Madison, so it&rsquo;s an important difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan also referred on TV to &quot;73 percent of new jobs,&quot; when the figures he is citing actually address net job growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pocan&rsquo;s phrasing implies he has data on where each new job in the state was created, when he is actually referring to the change in total employment &mdash; how many people had jobs at one point in time compared to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Job figures don&rsquo;t match Pocan&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the 73 percent figure, let&rsquo;s first look at what Pocan actually said &mdash; that the City of Madison was responsible for 73 percent of growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates Madison added a net of 13,000 jobs from 2006-&rsquo;16, while the state added 87,000. That would be 15 percent of the statewide growth &mdash; far less than Pocan asserted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers come from the bureau&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/lau\"> Local Area Unemployment Statistics</a>, which uses household-level data and surveys to estimate the labor force, employment and unemployment numbers. It&rsquo;s the only dataset with city-level data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the number Pocan was intending to cite (and did cite in news releases), attributing the increase to Dane County?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s closer, but still off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics Economist Steve Hipple said a different dataset,<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm\"> Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages</a>, is the best measure of job growth. That is based on state unemployment insurance filings and produces county and state-level employment figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest available employment data, through the second quarter of 2016, shows Dane County is responsible for 58 percent of the state&rsquo;s job growth from 2006-&rsquo;16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dan Kennelly, manager of Madison&rsquo;s Office of Business Resources, said the number is that high largely due to the Great Recession. Dane County was significantly less affected than the rest of the state, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you look at more recent years, the statewide numbers look significantly stronger compared to Dane County,&quot; Kennelly said. &quot;This is likely because while Dane County&rsquo;s economy stayed relatively strong through the recession, the statewide economy took a bigger dive and therefore had a deeper hole to climb out of during the recovery over the last few years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kolovson, the Pocan spokesman, said the 73 percent figure came from a<a href=\"http://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/economicdevelopment/documents/SYMPOSIUM_FULL%20PRESENTATION.pdf\"> presentation</a> made by Madison city development officials at a September 2014 symposium. That presentation said 73 percent of &quot;net new jobs&quot; created in Wisconsin from 2004-&rsquo;14 were in Dane County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the data is at least two years old, and not in line with Pocan&rsquo;s reference to it as being &quot;in the last decade.&quot; And the number is wrong for that timespan anyhow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennelly, who did the calculations behind the 73 percent figure, said he used the same Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. But the symposium occurred with three months left in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full-year data for 2004-14 shows Dane County accounted for 55 percent of the job growth statewide in that span.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his defense of Madison, Pocan highlighted the area&rsquo;s job creation by saying the city is responsible for 73 percent of new jobs in the state over the last decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his claim attributed Dane County data to Madison, referred to &quot;new jobs&quot; when he meant job growth and was built on two-year-old data that is wrong itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p> <div id=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"eb93e7c9-6570-4142-af73-2c11ac9989d0\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ClaimReview\"> <div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div> <div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"> <div itemprop=\"name\"><a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/\">Politifact</a></div> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-false.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact\" /> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\">4</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"bestRating\">6</div> <img style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-false.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" /> Politifact Rating: <div style=\"font-weight: bold\" itemprop=\"alternateName\"></div> </div> <div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\" itemprop=\"claimReviewed\">\"In the last decade, 73% of new jobs (in Wisconsin) have come from Madison.\" </div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\"> <div itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"> <div itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div itemprop=\"name\">Mark Pocan</div> <div itemprop=\"jobTitle\">U.S. representative, D-Wis.</div> </div> <img style=\"display:none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/Mark_Pocan.jpg\" /> <div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\" itemprop=\"name\">In an interview</div> <div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Thursday, December 8, 2016</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">-12/-08/2016</div> </div> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/19/mark-pocan/pocan-wrongly-claims-last-decade-73-new-jobs-wisco/\" itemprop=\"url\">Read More</a> <div style=\"float: right\"> <a href=\"#\">info</a> </div> </div> </div> </div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-18T11:34:16.495038", "ruling_date": "2017-01-19T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Pocan wrongly claims 'in the last decade, 73% of new jobs' in Wisconsin 'have come from Madison'", "ruling_headline_slug": "pocan-wrongly-claims-last-decade-73-new-jobs-wisco", "ruling_link_text": "Wrong area, wrong description, wrong data", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube.com,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNY9Uv_GudA\"> Dem wants GOP lawmaker to apologize for insulting community</a>, Dec. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm\"> Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages</a>, 2016 Q2 and 2006 Q2, accessed Jan. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,<a href=\"https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?fq=survey:%5bla%5d&amp;q=la\"> Local Area Unemployment Statistics</a>, 2016 and 2006, accessed Jan. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,<a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LAUCT554800000000005\"> Local Area Unemployment Statistics</a>, Madison, accessed Jan. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with David Kolovson, spokesman for Mark Pocan, Jan. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Pocan press release,<a href=\"https://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-pocan-calls-out-rep-duffy-for-saying-madison-is-a-communist\"> Rep.
