He told PolitiFact that he was sent to Hong Kong for two years to increase manufacturing and contracts in Asia for the firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was sent to Asia to open those markets for Sara Lee, and we did,&quot; Perdue said. &quot;That was the direction of the company at the time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue&rsquo;s effort to open the region for Sara Lee was a success, as was the firm for part of that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sara Lee was founded in 1939 as a food processing and distribution company. Its iconic name came from the 1956 purchase of the Kitchens of Sara Lee, a Chicago bakery known for its cheesecake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the early 1990s, though, Sara Lee had expanded worldwide and into other industries with its purchase of Hanes Corporation and Coach leather goods, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first three years of the decade, the company rapidly splurged even more, focusing on foreign firms and other well-known brands such as undergarment maker Playtex,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors began to question the company&rsquo;s broad vision, though. The result was the first of several major restructuring plans and layoffs in 1994, Perdue&rsquo;s last year with Sara Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1994 overhaul eliminated 9,900 jobs worldwide, while &quot;realigning production and distribution facilities throughout the world,&quot; according to SEC filings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the casualties were 540 jobs at apparel plants in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville. A fourth Georgia plant, in Midway, was also shut down, though the number of jobs lost was not published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sara Lee&rsquo;s annual report from 1994 does not break down how many of its 144,900 employees were domestic or foreign. However, a statement from the company at the time said most of the eliminated jobs were at European operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual report does note the company&rsquo;s success in manufacturing and sales in Asia, especially in China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, now part of China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;David Perdue says he&#39;s the better candidate because he&#39;s spent his career in the &#39;real world,&#39; but at too many stops along the way, he seemed to prosper while the people who worked for him saw their livelihoods taken away,&quot; said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By all indications, the outsourcing effort at Sara Lee did have that effect. The company expanded what it made and sold in Asia, at a time when it was closing facilities elsewhere, including in Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a senior vice president, Perdue had limited input on that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he did execute Sara Lee&rsquo;s effort, which the company lauded in its own annual report to federal regulators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn&rsquo;s claim is carefully worded to say Perdue&rsquo;s company, not the candidate himself, was shutting Georgia plants at a time it was adding jobs in Asia. News reports and company filings back up the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Nunn&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-04T14:57:00.654849", "ruling_date": "2014-09-05T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Claim about Perdue's former firm hits mark", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-about-perdues-former-firm-hits-mark", "ruling_link_text": "Company closed Georgia plants during Asia expansion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Michelle Nunn ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTREGpKHHKQ\"><strong>Real</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/23666/0000950124-94-001506.txt\"><strong>Sara Lee Corp., 10-K</strong></a> filed July 2, 1994</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/david-perdues-business-background-looms-large-in-s/nZJSf/\"><strong>David Perdue&rsquo;s business background looms large in Senate run</strong></a>,&quot;
