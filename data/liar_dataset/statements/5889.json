Is Barrett really &quot;campaigning on&quot; raising them?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with some background.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker and the Republican-led Legislature adopted strict <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/559/freeze-property-taxes/\">property tax caps</a> as part of the 2011-2013 state budget. For counties and municipalities, growth in the levy is limited to the value of new construction. Walker and lawmakers also cut school aid and reduced the overall amount of revenue that schools could raise in state aid and property taxes -- known as the revenue limit -- by 5.5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe result?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/taxmemo.pdf\">According</a> to the state Department of Revenue, the total property tax levy in the state rose by just $21 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2011. And property taxes on the median home valued at $157,600 fell about $11, or 0.4 percent, to $2,951 -- the first such drop since 1999.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Walker&rsquo;s ad focuses on Barrett&rsquo;s position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Walker&rsquo;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn accusing Barrett of campaigning to lift the caps, the ad cites a <a href=\"http://wtaq.com/news/articles/2012/apr/17/barrett-falk-campaign-on-lifting-property-tax-ceilings/\">news article</a> on the website of WTAQ, an AM and FM radio station in Green Bay. The article was posted April 17, 2012, the day after Walker announced the property tax reduction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe headline on the article -- &quot;Barrett, Falk campaign on lifting property tax ceilings&quot; -- was almost word for word the message that appeared on the screen in Walker&rsquo;s ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the article itself made an important distinction between Barrett and Falk.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth criticized the property tax limits, but while Falk said she would repeal the limits, Barrett &quot;stopped short of making that promise,&quot; the article said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews to back Walker&rsquo;s claim, she argued that even if Barrett didn&rsquo;t promise to remove the caps, he nevertheless had campaigned to do so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMatthews pointed us to another part of the article, which quoted Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak as saying the caps are &quot;absolute and draconian.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMatthews also noted that a longer version of Walzak&rsquo;s comment appeared in a <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/falk-barrett-pledge-to-roll-back-tax-cuts-for-corporations-vp511ou-147657385.html\">article</a> the same day the radio station website article was posted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe newspaper, noting that Walzak&rsquo;s comment was made in a prepared statement, quoted Walzak as saying: &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority. But Walker&#39;s caps are absolute and draconian. They don&#39;t account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat statement shows Barrett is against keeping the current property tax caps in place -- but doesn&rsquo;t indicate whether Barrett would merely modify the limits or lift them altogether.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMatthews didn&rsquo;t provide any other evidence, and we couldn&rsquo;t find any other statements Barrett has made in the campaign about property tax caps.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Barrett&rsquo;s response</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalzak told us Barrett has not campaigned on lifting the caps, and that the statement he issued criticizing them was in response to a <em>Journal Sentinel</em> reporter&rsquo;s question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a relevant point, given that Barrett has campaigned repeatedly on a number of issues -- including restoring collective bargaining rights for public employees and &quot;ending the civil war&quot; that he says Walker started. But he hasn&rsquo;t emphasized property tax caps.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalzak also argued that Walker&rsquo;s ad wrongly implies Barrett would lift the caps in a way that would lead to widespread property tax increases, leaving no controls. But what Barrett advocates, according to Walzak, is working with local governments to give them flexibility to raise property taxes when more revenue is needed to spur economic growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the full statement Walzak issued on the subject:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Unlike the top-down imposition of policy that dictates policy instead of develops it in partnership with local leaders, Tom as governor will work with local governments and officials to determine what they need to make local investments to attract retain and create jobs on the local level. &nbsp;Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority. &nbsp;But Walker&#39;s caps are absolute and draconian. &nbsp;They don&#39;t account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth. &nbsp;These inflexible, rigid caps can actually stifle opportunities for local growth, because they can have a negative impact in investing in business parks and transportation infrastructure that are so often key to making investments that encourage business expansion or make local areas more attractive to businesses considering relocation from other states.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe complete statement makes it clear that Barrett wants to change the current property tax caps. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the fact that no other Barrett statements on the caps could be found indicates he has not been campaigning on the issue. And he has not articulated to what degree he would change the caps.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a TV ad, Walker claimed that Barrett is campaigning &quot;on lifting property tax ceilings.&quot; It was part of a more sweeping claim that taxes overall would go up with Barrett as governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett issued a statement during the campaign making it clear he wants to change the caps, so in that sense he would &quot;lift&quot; them. But he has not campaigned on the issue, nor spelled out how much he would modify the current limits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-walker-claim-barrett-is-campaigning-on-raising-property-taxes-no5c82o-151116375.html\">Journal Sentinel web site</a>)</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-10T11:36:09.525485", "ruling_date": "2012-05-11T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "In Wisconsin recall, Gov.
