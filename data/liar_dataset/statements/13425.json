No documents are cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim about a child trafficking and a pedophile sex ring links to <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/10/28/new-clinton-emails-found-during-anthony-weiner-sexting-probe/\">a <em>New York Post</em> story</a> that makes no reference to either child trafficking or a sex ring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim about the Clinton Foundation and members of Congress links to an <a href=\"http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3341662/pg1\">internet message board</a> where anonymous people have posted under the topic, &quot;Breaking: Its (sic) worse than classified emails.
