Because, the story says, the mammoth retailer is celebrating its 125th anniversary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, Walmart was<a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-history\"> founded in 1962</a>. So it&rsquo;s at least 55, not 125.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly for Walmart fans, the offer is not real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walmart spokeswoman Tara Aston confirmed the scam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We care deeply about our customers and have procedures in place to help protect them from criminal behavior,&quot; she said. &quot;We frequently review our educational and prevention measures and when necessary, take additional steps to better inform our customers about the dangers of scams.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walmart also clarifies on its website cases of fraud in which surveys are listed as potentially suspicious. A <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/privacy-security/fraud-alerts/\">legitimate survey</a> from Walmart is only taken on its official website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact decided to test out the offer. When clicking on the survey link, we were notified that only 456 coupons remained. (That number didn&rsquo;t change as we refreshed and revisited the page at different points.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey consists of three questions: Have you ever shopped at Walmart? You prefer Walmart because of? Are you satisfied by the services of Walmart?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we finished, we were asked to share the survey with our Facebook friends &mdash; the promised coupon never materialized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a bug.
