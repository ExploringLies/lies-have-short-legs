It was flagged by Facebook as part of the social media giant&rsquo;s attempts to stamp out fake news on its site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post opens by saying Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time, had signed a restrictive abortion bill. It then goes on to quote Pence as saying the bill didn&rsquo;t have an exception for victims of rape because &quot;we&rsquo;d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, Pence never said these things. The story originated on a family of websites known for creating stories based on real events, but with made-up details in what it describes as an attempt to be funny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicot.com is part of the <a href=\"http://www.newslo.com/mike-pence-allowing-rape-victims-abortions-will-lead-women-trying-get-raped/\">Newslo network of sites</a>, which we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/jan/27/fact-checking-fake-news-reveals-how-hard-it-kill-p/\">written about before</a>, including one fake story about Pence calling Michelle Obama &quot;the most vulgar first lady we&rsquo;ve ever had.&quot; We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/20/politiconocom/satirical-site-made-story-mike-pence-called-michel/\">Pants On Fire</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site <a href=\"http://politicot.com/about-us/\">describes itself</a> as a &quot;hybrid News/Satire platform&quot; that focuses on &quot;entertainment.&quot; The only indication that the stories might be fake is a &quot;Show Facts&quot; button that highlight what is true, leaving the reader to surmise that the rest of the story is contrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, what Politicot.com deems as &quot;facts&quot; is limited to the opening paragraph, which noted Pence had &quot;recently&quot; signed a bill restricting abortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence did sign <a href=\"https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2016/bills/house/1337#digest-heading\">an abortion bill</a> in March 2016 that prevented women from getting an abortion <a href=\"http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/03/24/pence-signs-new-abortion-restrictions-into-law-prayer/82225890/\">due to the race, gender, or disability of the fetus</a>. Indiana already was one of the most restrictive states in the country for women seeking abortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Politicot.com story seems to have been timed to react to Pence <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/14/politics/donald-trump-vice-presidential-choice/\">being picked as Donald Trump&rsquo;s running mate</a> on July 15. The site did not respond to our request for clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve acknowledged in the past that Politicot.com&rsquo;s related sites don&rsquo;t do a good enough job of pointing out their stories are fake, and exacerbate problems by building contrived details upon real news events.
