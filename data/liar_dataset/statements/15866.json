A loving gay couple or b.)

Harold&rsquo;s answers indicated she supported defining marriage as between a man and woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, a spokesman for Harold said she no longer supports a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in light of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2015 ruling legalizing it.
