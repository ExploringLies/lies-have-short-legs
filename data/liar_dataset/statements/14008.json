But the post does acknowledge something that would make expulsion difficult &mdash; she isn&rsquo;t going to school there yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House announced in 2016 after she was accepted that Malia Obama would <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/01/politics/malia-obama-college-decision-harvard-gap-year/\">take a gap year</a> before enrolling in the fall of 2017. What has she been up to since then? Things a teen with a year off would do, probably, like <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2017/03/30/malia-obama-tall-mystery-man/\">hang out with boys in Manhattan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the post&rsquo;s other details, Harvard does <a href=\"https://www.hupd.harvard.edu/drug-and-alcohol-policy\">prohibit drugs and alcohol</a> on campus, where current students would face penalties (expelling the former first daughter seems unlikely in any event). Harvard doesn&rsquo;t have a chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.harvard.edu/president\">it has a president</a>, and her name is Drew Gilpin Faust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, the post <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-malia-obama-expelled-from-harvard/\">originally appeared April 9</a> on TheLastLineOfDefense.org.
