The day after an audit critical of the agency went public on May 14, 2013, the IRS posted on a<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Questions-and-Answers-on-501%28c%29-Organizations\"> question-and-answer page</a> that &quot;the number of applications has more than doubled in recent years.&quot; The agency connected that directly to the singling out of tea party groups, writing &quot;this inappropriate criterion was used as a shortcut to centralize similar cases.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., took issue with that argument. At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Tuesday, he spoke about myths being &quot;thrown around.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;There was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010,&quot; Griffin said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s possible to check whether a flood of paperwork was a contributing factor in the IRS missteps and we can see if Griffin is on solid ground.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe IRS keeps track of its workload and according to the inspector general&rsquo;s audit, IRS staff was on the lookout for tea party-type groups at least six months before we see a jump in the number of applications. In fact, the data tell us that the volume of applications had dropped a bit from the year before the screening began.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how the activity breaks down for 501(c)(4) applications, the sort of tax-exempt group where political activity is allowed:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2009:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,751</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2010:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,735</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2011:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,265</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2012:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,357</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe inspector general&rsquo;s report said <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2013reports/201310053fr.html\">these figures </a>came from the IRS Exempt Organizations office and were for the fiscal year. As a reminder, the government&rsquo;s fiscal year starts in October, so FY 2010 begins on Oct. 1, 2009, and runs through the end of September 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe inspector general&rsquo;s report also provides <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2013reports/201310053fr.html#comprehensive\">a detailed timeline </a>that tracks when the tea party screening began. On about March 1, 2010, a manager asked a staffer to tally the number of tea party-related applications. According to the report, the staffer &quot;used Tea Party, Patriots, and 9/12 as part of the criteria for these searches.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe earliest that there might have been a jump in applications would have been in October 2010. That is well after the IRS began its effort to give selective treatment to tea party groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe IRS is correct in saying that the number of applications doubled, but that happened later -- from 2011 to 2012. We contacted the IRS and nothing we learned changes the numbers or the sequence of events.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tReporters for the <em><a href=\"http://philanthropy.com/article/IRS-Rationale-for-Tea-Party/139277/\">Chronicle of Philanthropy </a></em>and the <em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/06/06/common-misconceptions-about-the-irs-targeting-campaign/\">Washington Post</a></em> have sifted the facts, too, and reached the same conclusion: The rise in applications for 501(c)(4) status came after the IRS began treating tea party-type groups differently.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGriffin said there was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010, and the numbers from the IRS back him up. The timeline in the Inspector General&rsquo;s audit shows that the selective treatment of groups based on their ties to the tea party movement began before any rise in the IRS workload.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-07T09:52:43.843901", "ruling_date": "2013-06-07T10:55:36", "ruling_headline": "No rise in applications triggered IRS actions says Tim Griffin", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-rise-applications-triggered-irs-actions-says-ti", "ruling_link_text": "Application jump came later", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCongressional Quarterly, <a href=\"http://w3.nexis.com/new/results/docview/docview.do?start=1&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;risb=21_T17555183634\">House Ways and Means Committee hearing transcript</a>, June 4, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Chronicle of Philanthropy</em>, <a href=\"http://philanthropy.com/article/IRS-Rationale-for-Tea-Party/139277/\">IRS Rationale for Tea Party Scandal Is Debunked by Data</a>, May 15, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/06/06/common-misconceptions-about-the-irs-targeting-campaign/\">Clarifying common misconceptions about the IRS targeting campaign</a>, June 6, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>USA Today</em>, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/05/13/irs-exempt-organizations-editorials-debates/2156991/\">IRS: &quot;We should have done a better job&quot;</a>, May 13, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInternal Revenue Service, <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Questions-and-Answers-on-501%28c%29-Organizations\">Questions and answers on 501(c) organizations</a>, May 15, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBreitbart,<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/17/there-were-fewer-c4-applications-when-irs-began-targeting-tea-party\"> Applications for tax -exempt status were down when IRS began targeting tea party</a>, May 17, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Congressman from the 2nd district of Arkansas", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Tim", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Arkansas", "id": 2323, "last_name": "Griffin", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "tim-griffin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Griffin.gif", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2323/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.griffin.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;There was no surge in 501(c)(4) applications in 2010.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a House Ways and Means hearing", "statement_date": "2013-06-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
