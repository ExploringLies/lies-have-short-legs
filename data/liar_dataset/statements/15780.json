John McCain&rsquo;s death, false information spread claiming that former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had been appointed to replace McCain in the U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCain, who had brain cancer, died Aug. 25. McCain represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate from 1987 until his death at age 81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://trumpbetrayed.us/all/sheriff-joe-blows-trump-on-weekends-at-bedminster/\">An Aug. 26 headline</a> on the site trumpbetrayed.us claimed, &quot;BREAKING: Sheriff Joe Arpaio will take over McCain&rsquo;s seat in the Senate.&quot; This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of McCain&rsquo;s death, Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is now tasked with appointing someone to replace McCain in the U.S. Senate. But he has not done so yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ducey&rsquo;s office <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/arizona-governor-to-wait-until-after-mccain-burial-to-announce-senate-successor/2018/08/26/159c6ece-a950-11e8-8a0c-70b618c98d3c_story.html?utm_term=.f59bc6ef99e5\">said</a> that &quot;out of respect for the life and legacy&quot; of McCain and his family, the governor will not name an appointment until after McCain is laid to rest. McCain&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.johnmccain.com/press/advisories/usna/\">burial</a> is set for Sept. 2 at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Md.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00222.htm\">Under Arizona law</a>, Ducey is to appoint someone of the same party &mdash; a Republican &mdash; and that person will serve at least until the 2020 general election. Whoever is elected in 2020 will finish the rest of McCain&rsquo;s six-year-term that expires in January 2023, after the 2022 general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arpaio <em>is</em> seeking to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate, and will be on the Republican primary ballot Aug. 28. But that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s competing in the race to replace Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring at the end of his term January 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story on trumpbetrayed.us includes a line that may help tip readers off that this story is false. It says, &quot;The good news for the GOP is that Governor Jaleel White, a Republican like Bobby Jindal, has decided to appoint a man who will vote with Donald Trump.&quot; Jaleel White is the actor who played Steve Urkel in the sitcom Family Matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The false story ropes in Hillary Clinton, claiming she &quot;filed in court to initiate a special election, with her facing Arpaio in a one-on-one showdown&quot; and said there&rsquo;d be an update &quot;on this story that now involves the Clintons, meaning that inevitably &mdash; someone is going to die.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website&rsquo;s banner in large letters identifies as &quot;America&rsquo;s Last Line of Defense&quot; and in smaller letter warns it&rsquo;s &quot;information you probably shouldn&rsquo;t trust.&quot; (Check out PunditFact&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/may/31/If-youre-fooled-by-fake-news-this-man-probably-wro/\">report</a> on other fake news written under this banner.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the bottom of the page for the McCain story, the site says its content is satire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the site claims its writings are satire, many Facebook users appear to believe the story was true. The Facebook page for America&rsquo;s Last Line of Defense posted a link to the trumpbetrayed.us story and it was shared more than 750 times; while some users commented that the story was fake, others welcomed the purported news. The person who runs America&rsquo;s Last Line of Defense, Christopher Blair, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/may/31/If-youre-fooled-by-fake-news-this-man-probably-wro/\">has told us in the past</a> that his websites are created to trick conservatives and make money. &quot;I discovered that Facebook following plus blog plus ads equals income,&quot; Blair said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fabricated headline and story claimed Arpaio had been appointed to replace McCain in the U.S. Senate.
