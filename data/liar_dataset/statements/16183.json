So! Next time Trump says our Troops will protect themselves from rock throwers and they fuss &amp; whine.... Show them this! Authorities were searching Texas&#39; Big Bend area for suspects and witnesses Monday after US Customs and Border Protection agent Rogelio Martinez was allegedly beaten to death with a rock while on patrol.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This post was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Martinez&#39;s death occurred nearly a year ago, on Nov. 18, 2017, and a subsequent investigation found there was no evidence that he was murdered. Sowers is citing outdated information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, people jumped to the conclusion that Martinez and his partner had been attacked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Border Patrol <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/border-patrol-agent-big-bend-sector-killed-line-duty\">reported</a> that Martinez had died and his partner hospitalized with serious injuries &quot;in the line of duty.&quot; It said Martinez&#39;s unidentified partner &quot;reported that they were both injured and in need of assistance&quot; and that officials were &quot;searching the area for potential suspects or witnesses.&quot; The border patrol never specifically said the two were attacked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But others, including Texas <a href=\"https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=3496\">Sen. Ted Cruz</a>, did. And the next Monday morning Texas Gov. Greg Abbott released a tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovAbbott/status/932672808768942082\">announcing a reward of up to $20,000</a> &quot;for information leading to arrest of those responsible for death of Border Patrol agent.&quot; Two weeks after the death, with the FBI still investigating, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/dramatic-spike-in-violent-attacks-against-us-border-agents-provokes-outrage\">Fox news reported</a> that &quot;officials with the National Border Patrol Council assert they were unequivocally the result of an attack by assailants using rocks, a common weapon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Feb. 7, 2018, the FBI released a <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/elpaso/news/press-releases/fbi-el-paso-findings-of-the-investigation-into-the-death-of-border-patrol-agent\">statement</a> saying that although it was receptive to any new information about the case, &quot;To date none of the more than 650 interviews completed, locations searched, or evidence collected and analyzed have produced evidence that would support the existence of a scuffle, altercation, or attack on November 18, 2017.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The partner, Stephen Garland, had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/us/border-patrol-agent-death-investigation.html\">no recollection</a> of what happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martinez&#39;s partner had contacted a Border Patrol dispatcher by phone, the FBI reported. &quot;Although disoriented and unsure of his location, the second Border Patrol Agent advised that both he and Agent Martinez were hurt. The second Border Patrol Agent also made a statement to the effect of, &#39;We ran into a culvert,&#39; &#39;I ran into a culvert,&#39; or &#39;I think I ran into a culvert.&#39; The dispatcher also wrote into a Border Patrol log, &#39;[He] thinks they (both agents) ran into a culvert.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the FBI investigation were widely publicized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, Martinez and his picture are still being used as evidence of the murderous intent of people who cross the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-04T12:29:58.282776", "ruling_date": "2018-11-04T14:07:57", "ruling_headline": "Fatal accident falsely used as evidence of murderous intent of border-crossers", "ruling_headline_slug": "fatal-accident-falsely-used-evidence-murderous-int", "ruling_link_text": "Only the truth gets ambushed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=500553094108560&amp;set=a.106586793505194&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">Facebook post</a>, Todd Sowers, Nov. 2, 2018, accessed Nov. 4, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/border-patrol-agent-big-bend-sector-killed-line-duty\">Border Patrol Agent from Big Bend Sector Killed in Line of Duty</a>,&quot; U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Nov. 19, 2017, accessed Nov. 4, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=3496\">Sen.
