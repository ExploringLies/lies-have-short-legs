The decades have done little to ease those concerns. In 2013, the <a href=\"http://gao.gov/assets/660/659515.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Government Accountability Office</u></a> reported that in the year before, oil and gas companies took in revenues of $66 billion and paid $10 billion to the government. Onshore leases in particular have not kept pace with the times, according to the GAO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conservation group Center for Western Priorities took up this banner with an intriguing comparison on <a href=\"http://westernpriorities.org/fairshare/?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=1501fairshareads\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>its website</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac,&quot; the center wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The going price for a Big Mac, without the fries and the drink, is <a href=\"http://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/mcdonalds-prices/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$3.99</u></a>. We decided to check whether you can lease an acre of federal land for less than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg Zimmerman, the policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, sent us a link to a <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/minerals/oil___gas/2014_lease_sales0.Par.32121.File.dat/20140909_Competivtive_OG_Lease_Sale_Results.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>September 2014 sales report</u></a> from the Nevada office of the Bureau of Land Management. The numbers back up Zimmerman&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas-based Appaloosa Energy paid $6,426 for the rights to drill on 3,212 acres. Buena Vista Holdings out of Colorado paid $11,392 for the rights to 5,693 acres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That comes out to $2 per acre, and even the mathematically challenged can see that is about half the price of a Big Mac. Under <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/oil_and_gas/questions_and_answers.print.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>BLM regulations</u></a>, $2 per acre is the minimum possible bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to be clear, the company pays this money each year for the right to pump oil or gas from the land over a 10-year period. It doesn&rsquo;t actually own the land, but it has locked down the oil and gas rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zimmerman acknowledges that there is another wrinkle here. There&rsquo;s an additional $1.50 per acre fee for the first five years. Zimmerman described it as the cost to hold the land while the company assesses what to do with it. A BLM spokesman told PunditFact that the bidder would pay $1.50 per year for the first five years and then $2.00 a year for the next five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nevertheless, even if you add the $1.50 per acre rent to the $2.00 per acre bid, it would still be less than a Big Mac,&quot; Zimmerman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the land ever starts producing oil or gas, the company starts paying royalties to the government on top of the $2 per acre leasing fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the statement simply said oil companies <em>can</em> obtain an acre for very little money. It doesn&rsquo;t say this happens a lot. When we ran the numbers for <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/wo/MINERALS__REALTY__AND_RESOURCE_PROTECTION_/energy/oil___gas_statistics/data_sets.Par.97646.File.dat/O&amp;G%20Lease%20Sale%20Results%20FY2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>all of 2014</u></a>, we found that the average price per acre nationwide was $220. That was for parcels leased through a competitive auction. If a parcel finds no takers through competitive bidding, the government can offer it non-competitively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/minerals/oil___gas/2014_lease_sales0.Par.1322.File.dat/20141209_OG_NonCompetitive_Lease_Sale_Results.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>One time</u></a>, that led to a winning bid of about $1.50 per acre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From what we could find, the lowest lease prices were all in Nevada. Brad Posey is a managing director for Appaloosa Energy, a company that successfully secured the right to a few thousand acres at a cost of $2 each. Posey said the property comes with many hurdles before any wells can be drilled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That land has so many restrictions on it,&quot; Posey said. &quot;There are the prairie chickens, and habitat. A very limited portion can be explored on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Posey is correct about the land. A <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/field_offices/winnemucca_field_office/rmp/rmp_files.Par.85319.File.dat/Dear_Reader_-_Abstract_-_Executive_Summary.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>proposed resource management plan</u></a> for the entire area puts a number of conditions on development. It protects municipal water supplies, grazing areas and trails for off-road trail riding. And animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These areas contain some of the most important habitat remaining for sage-grouse and other at-risk wildlife,&quot; the plan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Posey called the venture &quot;pure wildcat speculation.&quot; This raises the question, if it&rsquo;s such a long shot, why is the land worth even $2 an acre?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because, as another Appaloosa managing director Martin Shields explained, sometimes an unpromising bit of land surprises you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Many years ago, I was with a company that paid the $2 minimum and it paid off,&quot; Shields said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Zimmerman if he knew of any land that went for $2 an acre that ever produced oil or gas. Zimmerman said he did not know of any case when it did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center for Western Priorities said that oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac. A Big Mac goes for $3.99. Thousands of acres of land in Nevada were leased for $2 per acre in 2014. We found one case where federal land went for about $1.50 an acre. The track record on land leased at those low rates ever producing oil or gas is quite poor and the average leasing price nationwide is $220 per acre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is accurate but it downplays that companies pay a hundred times as much for land that is more likely to be productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-16T12:16:38.048089", "ruling_date": "2015-02-16T13:30:09", "ruling_headline": "Conservation group: Oil firms can lease federal land for less than the price of a Big Mac", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservation-group-oil-firms-can-lease-federal-lan", "ruling_link_text": "But you might not be lovin' it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Center for Western Priorities, <a href=\"http://westernpriorities.org/fairshare/?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=1501fairshareads\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fair Share campaign</u></a>, Feb. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Land Management, <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/wo/MINERALS__REALTY__AND_RESOURCE_PROTECTION_/energy/oil___gas_statistics/data_sets.Par.97646.File.dat/O&amp;G%20Lease%20Sale%20Results%20FY2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>National Oil and Gas Lease Sales, FY2014</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://gao.gov/assets/660/659515.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Oil and gas resources: Actions Needed for Interior to Better Ensure a Fair Return</u></a>, December 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Land Management, <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/minerals/oil___gas/2014_lease_sales0.Par.32121.File.dat/20140909_Competivtive_OG_Lease_Sale_Results.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nevada State Office: September 2014 Carson City and Winnemucca Districts Competitive Oil and Gas Lease Sale Results</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Land Management, <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/minerals/oil___gas/2014_lease_sales0.Par.1322.File.dat/20141209_OG_NonCompetitive_Lease_Sale_Results.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nevada State Office: December 2014 non-competitive oil and gas lease sales results</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Drillings, <a href=\"http://thedrillings.com/claims/nvn----092688\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>NVN 092688</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Land Management, <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nv/field_offices/winnemucca_field_office/rmp/rmp_files.Par.85319.File.dat/Dear_Reader_-_Abstract_-_Executive_Summary.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Winnemucca District proposed resource management plan and final environmental impact statement</u></a>, August 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Land Management, <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/oil_and_gas/questions_and_answers.print.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Questions and answers about oil and gas leasing</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Land Management, <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/wo/Communications_Directorate/public_affairs/news_release_attachments.Par.60974.File.dat/FY2015_BLM_Greenbook.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Budget justifications and performance information for FY 2015</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of the Interior, <a href=\"http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Onshore-Oil-and-Gas-Lease-Sales-Garner-256-Million-for-American-Taxpayers-in-2011.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Onshore Oil &amp;
