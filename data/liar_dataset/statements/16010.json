But no one is producing ultra-high-definition flat screens yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thousands expected: </strong>Foxconn has said it plans to initially employ 3,000 people &nbsp;&mdash; and eventually 13,000 &mdash; at the plant. So, West&rsquo;s figure of 4,000 jobs is in that range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wages:</strong> Foxconn&rsquo;s contract with the state says the average annual salary <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2017/07/27/foxconn-says-create-thousands-jobs-surprisingly-good-wages/513731001/\">will be $53,875</a>, plus benefits. So, West&rsquo;s claim of $53,000 is on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics of the Foxconn deal have questioned whether the average would reach that level only by Foxconn paying huge salaries to executives, and then paying wages well below the $53,875 to a large portion of employees. <a href=\"https://www.biztimes.com/2018/ideas/government-politics/foxconn-sought-flexibility-in-meeting-average-wage-target/\">Under the state&rsquo;s contract</a> with Foxconn, wages paid up to $400,000 annually will be counted as part of the average.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>West says in Wisconsin, Foxconn has &quot;4,000 jobs, people making $53,000 a year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Taiwanese company has broken ground on a massive electronics factory that it says will initially employ 3,000 people, and eventually 13,000, at an average wage of nearly $54,000 per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But both figures are plans, albeit connected to a contract Foxconn has signed with the State of Wisconsin.
