A solid majority of them -- about 60 percent -- run as Republicans, so Schimel had a natural advantage vs. Happ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a fair number of law enforcement officials decline to endorse, so the advantage is not guaranteed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We analyzed the endorsement lists of both candidates and here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combined, <a href=\"http://www.susanhappforwisconsin.com/endorsements\">Happ</a> and <a href=\"https://bradschimel.com/join/campaign-trail/\">Schimel</a> claim 112 endorsements from current DAs and sheriffs. Schimel has received 80 percent of those endorsements. If you were to look at all sheriffs and DAs -- including those who have not issued endorsements -- his total of 89 would represent about 60 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significantly, Schimel won over nine Democrats and one independent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, Happ&rsquo;s 23 endorsements were all from within her party -- not a single Republican official defected to her side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line, Schimel started with a natural &quot;base&quot; of 60 percent, but wound up with 80 percent support from those who endorsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, by that measure his &quot;overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders&quot; claim holds up to scrutiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his claim can also be read as a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By that measure, he is accurate with Republicans, but not with Democrats. Of the 32 Democrats who have endorsed, Happ received 23 compared to Schimel&rsquo;s nine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Schimel, that is 28 percent of the nods from Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s 28 percent more than Happ won from Republicans, but not a majority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schimel&rsquo;s ad says that &quot;an overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AG candidate has won 80 percent support from those who endorsed, and wooed 9 Democrats into the fold. He has won a clear majority overall, and from Republicans, but not from Democrats alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That makes for a partially accurate claim, our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-09T13:16:02.155503", "ruling_date": "2014-10-13T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Brad Schimel says most Republican and Democrat colleagues have endorsed him", "ruling_headline_slug": "brad-schimel-says-most-republican-and-democrat-col", "ruling_link_text": "Didn't dominate among Dems", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Schimel campaign TV ad, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x897dqGfunU\">&quot;Law enforcement&rsquo;s choice,&quot;</a> Oct. 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schimel campaign <a href=\"https://bradschimel.com/join/campaign-trail/\">website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ campaign <a href=\"http://www.susanhappforwisconsin.com/endorsements\">website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Blue Book, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/bb/13bb/Stats_Local.pdf\">&quot;County Officers in Wisconsin,&quot;</a> (page 733), June 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchanges with Happ and Schimel campaigns</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Brad", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 2847, "last_name": "Schimel", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "brad-schimel", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Brad_Schimel.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2847/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;An overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign TV ad", "statement_date": "2014-10-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 177, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/177/", "subject": "Criminal Justice", "subject_slug": "criminal-justice", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Jefferson County District Attorney", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Susan", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 2864, "last_name": "Happ", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "susan-happ", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Susan_Happ.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2864/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.susanhappforwisconsin.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
