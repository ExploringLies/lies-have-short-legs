I do not say that,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it turns out he did say that climate change is a &quot;hoax&quot; of Chinese origin &mdash; as we&rsquo;ve found in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/bernie-s/yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h/\">fact-checks</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, &quot;The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sIB6KsIf_MI6Vn-Nl88hIuIPti7X9gUPJL7JNc7dBPZzkhWjHwIUzLMXrBxvMDmB_YHY6Lw6ipqrns5MgWsw1XuMipGuCmDm3yQrNb1AQieDPJJgubNEe6bUbgtphUWmJKS4Ra_n\" style=\"border:none; height:321px; width:617px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump clearly did say, at least once, that climate change was a Chinese hoax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subject of this 2012 tweet came up during a Jan. 18, 2016, episode of Fox &amp; Friends. In that interview, Trump indicated the tweet was a joke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax,&quot; Trump said. &quot;A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I&#39;d be &mdash; received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn&#39;t care less. They have very &mdash; you know, their standards are nothing. But they &mdash; in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it&#39;s very hard on our business.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump may call the mention of China&rsquo;s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word &quot;hoax&quot; to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated a claim that climate change is a &quot;hoax&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/01/lenar-whitney/republican-congressional-hopeful-says-global-warmi/\">Pants on Fire</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., &quot;Obama&#39;s talking about all of this with the global warming and &hellip; a lot of it&#39;s a hoax. It&#39;s a hoax. I mean, it&#39;s a money-making industry, okay? It&#39;s a hoax, a lot of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">tweeted</a>, &quot;NBC News just called it the great freeze &mdash; coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7FJUTPeD3rcrMMuDCHhae3JHUTC95oyQtKHP0AUbseyUCk2AIQpA_1iBf_m1G0Lu9r2uLzVWaRJDGmhKwf6f-Jdcg7YjgDi2vCDyX13NufrtFIp6aQbtIbou3ydd5agZVyX_J-Sv\" style=\"border:none; height:351px; width:592px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428414113463955457\">tweeted</a>: &quot;Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond.

I do not say that&quot; climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He certainly did say it &mdash; in a tweet four years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While he has since described that remark as a &quot;joke,&quot; Trump has repeatedly called climate change a &quot;hoax&quot; in speeches, tweets and media appearances. And he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change &quot;is done for the benefit of China.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because he hasn&rsquo;t pushed this exact theory in recent years, as far as we&rsquo;ve seen, there&rsquo;s a tiny grain of truth to Trump&rsquo;s claim. But it&rsquo;s still inaccurate. For that, we rate his statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/04109c43-9130-4b0a-8d47-1f5166741fc7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/04109c43-9130-4b0a-8d47-1f5166741fc7</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-26T21:35:19.292813", "ruling_date": "2016-09-26T22:03:15", "ruling_headline": "At New York debate, Donald Trump denies saying climate change is a Chinese hoax", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-denies-saying-global-warming-chinese-", "ruling_link_text": "He tweeted it in 2012", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/\">Yes, Donald Trump did call climate change a Chinese hoax</a>,&quot; June 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/bernie-s/yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h/\">What Donald Trump said about the Chinese inventing the &#39;hoax&#39; of climate change</a>,&quot; Jan. 24, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I did not &mdash; I did not &mdash; I do not say that.
