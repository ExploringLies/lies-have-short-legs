Chris Christie and how the say-what-he-wants, does-what-he-wants<strong> </strong>governor divides the GOP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservative talk radio host and panelist Larry Elder<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1311/04/cfr.01.html\"> <u>criticized</u></a> Christie for accepting the &quot;architecture of the welfare state,&quot; pointing to Christie&rsquo;s embrace of billions of dollars in federal aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In pressing his point, Elder made a head-spinning claim that our governments take almost $.50 of every $1 we earn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 1900, at all three levels of government, federal, state and local, government took less than 10 percent of the American people&#39;s money,&quot; Elder said. &quot;Now we&#39;re talking about 35 percent, and when you add a dollar value to mandates, you&#39;re talking almost 50 percent. Where&rsquo;s the outrage on the part of the Republican Party?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder&rsquo;s figures certainly are eye-popping, and his general point -- that the government consumes a lot more money than it did more than 100 years ago -- is true. But on the merits of his specific stats, experts we consulted urged caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder is essentially putting together two separate calculations to get to 50 percent. He&rsquo;s taking the direct cost of government as a percentage of the economy, then adding to it the cost of government regulations. The first half of this equation is straightforward; the second half is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, PolitiFact has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-now-spending-42-percent-our-ec/\"><u>addressed</u></a> the question of how large a portion of the economy is accounted for by government expenditures. We&rsquo;ll recap some of what we found here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 2012, the gross domestic product -- the size of the nation&rsquo;s economy -- was $16.2 trillion, according to the Commerce Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Meanwhile, the expenditures by all levels of government was $5.3 trillion, according to the Office of Management and Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using these figures, government at all levels accounted for 32.6 percent of gross domestic product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the way Elder phrased his claim -- using as the denominator &quot;the American people&rsquo;s money&quot; &nbsp;-- it&rsquo;s possible to use a different calculation. If you replace gross domestic product with personal income (which was about $13.7 trillion in 2012), then the percentage is a few points higher -- 38.5 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither of these figures gets Elder to &quot;nearly 50 percent.&quot; So the cost of regulations has to add an extra 10 to 16 points. Is the cost of regulation high enough to do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder cited 1980s-era work of free-market economist Milton Friedman, though Elder said even Friedman called estimating the burden of regulations &quot;a difficult, if not impossible thing to quantify.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder pointed us a 2009 report from<a href=\"http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2009/08/31/61-percent-national-income-goes-government\"> <u>Americans for Tax Reform Foundation</u></a> that said the combined cost of government spending and regulatory burdens at all levels totaled &quot;a whopping 61.34 percent&quot; of national income. In<a href=\"http://costofgovernment.org/congratulations-america-cost-government-finally-arrives-a1710\"> <u>2013</u></a>, the cost of government was down to 53 percent of the country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product, according to the anti-tax group, which was founded by Grover Norquist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data, Elder said, suggests that, if anything, &quot;I understated it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even economists sympathetic to the notion that government is too big are unwilling to say Elder&rsquo;s definitively right. They say the numbers are simply too squishy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government mandates &quot;do have a large burden,&quot; said Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. &quot;But the estimates shouldn&rsquo;t be treated with precision.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>William McBride of the business-backed Tax Foundation said Elder went &quot;out on a limb&quot; with his 50 percent figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the softness of the regulatory cost estimates, experts pointed out a few other question marks about the evidence Elder is using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation analysis only attempted to calculate a<a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43907-BudgetOutlook.pdf\"> <u>gross cost of regulations</u></a>, so it ignored any benefits regulations might have. (We reached out to Americans for Tax Reform but did not hear back.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Gross rather than a net cost of regulations analysis is pretty much intellectually indefensible,&quot; said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in taxes. &quot;Once we get into the net, who knows where it comes out. And, compared to what?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, saying the government &quot;took&quot; your money is misleading. Some of the money government collects comes back to you in the form or Social Security or Medicare, or any of a number of other government programs. While Republicans such as Elder may advocate that Americans should have more control over their money from cradle to grave, suggesting government simply takes $.50 on every $1 someone earns isn&rsquo;t the whole story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Elder wants to talk about mandates as increasing the percentage of government ownership, it&rsquo;s only fair to consider the other side,&quot; said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor. &quot;I pay money in payroll tax during my working years, then I get money back in my retirement years (from Social Security).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The whole exercise is rather silly (and pointless) because it does not take into account what the U.S. gets for its tax dollar,&quot; added Thomas Hungerford, a senior economist and director of tax and budget policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, said Bryan Camp, Texas Tech University tax professor<strong>, </strong>&quot;Mr. Elder&rsquo;s statement is too vague to be useful for any purpose other than generating &lsquo;hallelujahs!&rsquo; from the choir he is preaching to.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder said, &quot;When you add a dollar value to mandates,&quot; government took almost 50 percent &quot;of the American people&rsquo;s money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get to the mid-to-high 30 percent range. But getting the last 10 to 15 percentage points to get to &quot;almost 50 percent&quot; is less certain. Regulation does have a cost, but the exact cost is hard to pin down. Because his larger point -- that government spending has increased, and that mandates have a cost -- is valid, we rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-07T18:02:55.353249", "ruling_date": "2013-11-08T14:29:04", "ruling_headline": "Larry Elder says government takes almost 50 percent of the American people's money", "ruling_headline_slug": "larry-host-says-government-takes-almost-50-percent", "ruling_link_text": "Hard to pin a number on regulations", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Laurence Elder, Nov. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Daniel Shaviro, New York University School of Law tax professor, Nov. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Joseph Henchman, Tax Foundation vice president of legal and state projects, Nov. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Edward Kleinbard, University of Southern California School of Law professor, Nov. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with William McBride, Tax Foundation chief economist, Nov. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Thomas Hungerford, Economic Policy Institute senior economist and director of tax and budget policy, Nov. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email Interview with Chris Edwards, editor of DownsizingGovernment.org at Cato Institute, Nov. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Bryan Camp, Texas Tech University School of Law professor, Nov. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist, Nov. 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times opinion column by Milton Friedman, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/opinion/19opclassic.html\"><u>We have Socialism, Q.E.D.</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 31, 1989</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heartland Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2009/08/31/61-percent-national-income-goes-government\"><u>61 percent of national income goes to government</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 31, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizens for Tax Justice, &quot;<a href=\"http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2013/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america_in_2013.php#.UnvynnCsjTo\"><u>Who pays taxes in America in 2013</u></a>?&quot; April 2, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43907-BudgetOutlook.pdf\"><u>The budget and economic outlook: Fiscal years 2013 to 2023</u></a>,&quot; February 2013 (chart on page 20)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Economic Analysis, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&amp;step=1#reqid=9&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;910=X&amp;911=0&amp;903=58&amp;904=2011&amp;905=2013&amp;906=A\"><u>Table 2.1.
