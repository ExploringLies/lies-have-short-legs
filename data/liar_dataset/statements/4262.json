He was one of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://conrad.senate.gov/pressroom/record.cfm?id=320562\">25 original co-sponsors</a>&nbsp;of legislation in 2009 by&nbsp;Sens. Kent Conrad,&nbsp;D-N.D., and Judd Gregg,&nbsp;R-N.H., that would have created the task force. When it ultimately came up for a Senate vote as an amendment to an amendment to another bill in January 2010, the roll call at&nbsp;Senate.gov&nbsp;shows&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00005#top\">he voted for it</a>.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis &quot;Yea&quot; vote put him with about 40 percent of Republicans. The majority of his party colleagues voted against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat supports&nbsp;Hasner&#39;s&nbsp;claim that he &quot;voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats&quot; to create the task force. But&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;wasn&#39;t exactly a &quot;token Republican vote for the Democrats,&quot; as&nbsp;Hasner&#39;s&nbsp;team put it. Fifteen of&nbsp;LeMieux&#39;s&nbsp;Republican colleagues joined him. The Democrats were as divided as the Republicans, though more of them supported the plan. Meanwhile, the final 53-46 Senate vote &mdash; seven votes short of the 60 required &mdash; understates earlier Republican support for the task force.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSenate Minority leader Mitch McConnell had called it the &quot;best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that are threatening our nation&#39;s fiscal future.&quot; Then&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atr.org/atr-opposes-gregg-conradbr-bipartisan-tax-a4300\">antitax&nbsp;activists attacked it</a>&nbsp;for leaving the door open to tax increases, and President Barack Obama endorsed it the Saturday before the vote. Seven Republican co-sponsors withdrew their support. McConnell also voted against it,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/01/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-reverses-position-conrad-gregg-budget-co/\">earning a Full Flop from&nbsp;PolitiFact</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhich left&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;in his party&#39;s minority &mdash; but on a proposal with strong bipartisan roots.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Was that task force proposal &quot;strikingly similar&quot; to the&nbsp;supercommittee?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner&nbsp;accuses&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;of a flip-flop, saying he was &quot;for tax-raising committees before he was against them.&quot; But just how similar were the committees?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn some key ways, they&#39;re the same.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;is &quot;certainly a descendant of the task force and the many other similar type(s) of special mechanisms proposed to do the hard work Congress refuses to do,&quot; said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. &quot;... This is not a new idea.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe committee proposals both include members appointed by Democrats and Republicans, seek ideas to reduce the &quot;fiscal imbalance of the federal government&quot; and require Congress to fast-track recommendations to a vote with no amendments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut&nbsp;LeMieux&#39;s&nbsp;campaign points out a key difference: The 12-member&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;created by Congress requires just simple majority votes &mdash; for example, a single Republican could join six Democrats to endorse a plan. Meanwhile, the task force he supported required&nbsp;supermajority&nbsp;votes both by an 18-member committee and by Congress to implement its recommendations.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This would have protected taxpayers since the commission&#39;s plan would have needed the support of at least four of the eight Republicans on the commission to guarantee a vote in the House and Senate,&quot; said campaign manager Brian Seitchik. &quot;This would make it highly unlikely that the commission&#39;s plan would be able to get sufficient Republican support if it raised taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, are the committees &quot;strikingly similar&quot;? Yes, but arguably with enough room for&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;to explain why he might vote for one, but not support the other.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#000000\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" id=\"m1:n\" style=\"font-size: 1em; line-height: inherit; border-collapse: collapse;\" width=\"100%\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\"><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" face=\"verdana, helvetica, arial, sans-serif\"><b><a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SP3302:\" id=\"r.hq\" title=\"Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\">Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action</a></b></font></font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.365:\"><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\"><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" face=\"verdana, helvetica, arial, sans-serif\"><b>Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction</b></font></font></a></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\tGoal</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\tTo provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government, which may include expenditures and revenues</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\tTo reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion from 2012-21, providing recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the short-term and long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Members</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">18 (10 Democrats, 8 Republicans)</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">12 (6 Democrats, 6 Republicans)</font></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Time before committee vote on recommendations</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">41 weeks</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">16 weeks</font></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Number of members required for passage</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">14 of 18 (78 percent)</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">7 of 12 (58 percent)</font></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Fast-tracking in House and Senate</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Yes</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Yes</font></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Amendments allowed</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">No</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">No</font></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Votes required to pass Congress</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Supermajority&nbsp;in each chamber</font></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"2\">Simple majority</font></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Is the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;being &quot;set up ... to justify massive tax hikes&quot;?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow we get to the crux of&nbsp;Hasner&#39;s&nbsp;campaign message, that&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;supported &quot;tax-raising&quot; committees before he opposed them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Congress create the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;&quot;to justify massive tax hikes&quot;? And was raising taxes the purpose of the earlier task force that&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;supported?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConsider this a matter of vociferous debate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNeither the task force nor the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;proposals require tax increases. The earlier task force plan explicitly allowed for the possibility, saying that recommendations may include expenditures and revenues. Meanwhile, the supercommittee&nbsp;legislation requires a $1.5 trillion reduction in the deficit but doesn&#39;t prescribe how to get there. Spending cuts? Tax increases? It&#39;s up to the committee, which doesn&#39;t have to be named until Aug. 16, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, depending on whom you talk to, tax increases are guaranteed, likely &mdash; or, in the case of the&nbsp;supercommittee, not even possible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner&#39;s&nbsp;campaign cited a letter from&nbsp;antitax&nbsp;activist&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atr.org/atr-opposes-gregg-conradbr-bipartisan-tax-a4300\">Grover&nbsp;Norquist</a>, who opposed the earlier task force proposal. Norquist said that by relying on a committee that was not explicitly barred from raising taxes, tax hikes would occur.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Every Democrat on the commission would insist on tax increases to &#39;balance&#39; spending cuts in the recommendation. There is no conceivable scenario whereby the commission would issue a report that does not contain tax hikes,&quot; he wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011502413.html\">George F. Will</a>&nbsp;made a similar argument about the tax force proposal&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;supported: &quot;Substantively,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the task force would be a means of conscripting Republican participation in huge tax increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEllis of Taxpayers for Common Sense disagrees with the premise that either committee was designed to justify tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That&#39;s irresponsible fear-mongering, which is similar to those on the left saying the committee was established to slash Social Security or Medicare,&quot; Ellis said.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe points out that only half the senators who voted against the task force proposal were Republicans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t think Sen. (Bernie) Sanders, I-Vt., was voting against the committee because he was afraid it would raise taxes,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;vote actually spawned days of debate about whether it would allow for tax increases at all, much less &quot;massive&quot; ones.

The <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/07/31/fact-sheet-bipartisan-debt-deal-win-economy-and-budget-discipline\">White House</a> disagreed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe debate turned on a technical question: How would $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction be calculated?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/27507.html\">Some said</a>&nbsp;that, because the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;legislation asks for estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, it would require using&nbsp;CBO&#39;s&nbsp;typical &quot;current law&quot; baseline &mdash; one that assumes the Bush tax cuts will expire in 2012 &mdash; as opposed to a &quot;current policy&quot; or &quot;plausible&quot; baseline that assumes that what&#39;s true now stays in place whether that requires an act of Congress or not. <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3554\">Others said</a> the committee could request a different baseline.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf a current law baseline were required, Democrats wouldn&#39;t get any credit toward the $1.5 trillion for stopping or limiting the Bush tax cuts, for example, which would be presumed gone. Even if they wanted to do it anyway, increasing tax rates would get sticky.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The practical effect of this is that the bipartisan committee will be unable to make any recommendations regarding the Bush-era tax cuts,&quot; wrote Nick&nbsp;Kasprak&nbsp;of the business-backed Tax Foundation. &quot;For example, let&#39;s say the committee proposes, among other things, raising the top marginal tax rate 3 percentage points, from 35 percent to 38 percent, which would bring in some amount of revenue that counts towards their $1.5 trillion assignment. &#39;Hold on,&#39; says the Congressional Budget Office, &#39;According to our current law baseline, that rate is set to go up to 39.6 percent in 2013 when the Bush-era tax cuts expire, so this is actually a tax cut, and it makes the deficit worse.&#39; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne more&nbsp;curveball: If the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;deadlocks, or Congress doesn&#39;t pass what it recommends, the Budget Control Act includes an automatic trigger to cut $1.5 trillion across the board, split evenly between defense and everything else, and protecting just Social Security, Medicaid and veterans benefits. That&#39;s right:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2011/08/01/the-budget-deal/\">No deal means just cuts</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner&#39;s&nbsp;team said, &quot;George&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a &#39;Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action&#39; that looks strikingly similar to the &#39;Super Committee&#39; now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeMieux&nbsp;did vote against the majority of Republicans, joining with Democrats in an attempt to create a Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action &mdash; though the proposal had more bipartisan support than&nbsp;Hasner&#39;s&nbsp;full news release suggests. Meanwhile, while the task force would have been substantially similar to the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;just established by Congress, it&#39;s different enough that&nbsp;LeMieux&nbsp;could explain his change of support without a change of heart. Finally, it&#39;s a serious stretch to say the&nbsp;supercommittee&nbsp;was designed &quot;to justify massive tax hikes.&quot; While tax increases are one plausible outcome, they aren&#39;t required, and depending on the baseline committee members choose, may not even be likely.
