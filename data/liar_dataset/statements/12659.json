Trump has referenced her foundation ties in the past, saying she needs to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-clinton-foundation-224287\">return the $25 million</a>&quot; Saudi Arabia gave the foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The William J. Clinton Foundation was <a href=\"http://www.clintonfoundation.org/sites/default/files/clinton_foundation_form_1023_application_for_tax_exemption.pdf\">incorporated in 1997</a>. The foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether the Clintons&rsquo; donor list holds up to Trump&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot take money from foreign entities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not only governments,&quot; said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at&nbsp;Albany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin also noted that the former first lady played no role in the foundation while she was secretary of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Further, she did not blink before standing up to countries that oppressed their people and denied them of their rights, from LGBT rights to women&#39;s rights,&quot; Schwerin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless. looking at the Clinton Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%2410%2C000%2C001+to+%2425%2C000%2C000\">donor list</a>, Saudi Arabia gave between $10 million and $25 million. But the foundation reported the Saudi money <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/07/fact-checking-donations-clinton-foundation/\">in December 2008</a>,&nbsp;and the amount hasn&rsquo;t changed since.&nbsp;Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation has also taken between&nbsp;$1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported, several of these donations came <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-government-gifts-to-clinton-foundation-on-the-rise-1424223031\">in 2014</a>, after Clinton&#39;s tenure at the State Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ve fact-checked a similar claim before when&nbsp;Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of &quot;Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen.&quot; Every country except Yemen has contributed&nbsp;to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus&#39; claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money. We rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/20/reince-priebus/hillary-clinton-took-money-kings-four-countries-go/\">Half True</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Women&rsquo;s rights</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human Rights Watch tracks how women are treated in each of these countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Saudi Arabia, a woman needs &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/wr2015_web.pdf\">male guardian</a>&quot; approval on everything from obtaining a passport to seeking higher education. They also have no divorce rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Qatar, marital rape is permitted. Women need a male guardian to approve a marriage contract, and one law specifies that a wife must obey her husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that while there is a nondiscrimination law, women still face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gay rights</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, all sex outside of marriage, including same-sex intercourse,&nbsp;in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a married man, the penalty is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death-2/\">death by stoning</a>. An unmarried man faces 100 blows of a whip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Qatar, any sexual act outside of marriage is punishable by death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United Arab Emirates also bans sex outside of marriage,&nbsp;and the death penalty could apply to consensual &quot;same-sex relations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Oman, the country punishes same-sex acts by up to three years in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Trump&#39;s claim that these countries are throwing gay people &quot;off of&nbsp;buildings,&quot;&nbsp;he may be referring to the Islamic State. There is evidence that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bc4cf13c2b41454b820d7297f50bbf08/islamic-state-group-targets-gays-brutal-public-killings\">ISIS</a>&nbsp;has engaged in these acts, but in Syria.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Executions in Saudi Arabia specifically have increased recently, but&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34982154\">specific convictions</a>, and whether are they related to homosexuality,&nbsp;are hard to measure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not Clinton directly</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we spoke with questioned whether the donations to the foundation are directly attributable to Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana University public affairs professor emeritus Leslie Lenkowsky said Trump&rsquo;s claim is hyperbolic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These were not donations to Secretary Clinton as such, but to an organization with which she was closely involved (when not in office or seeking it), including serving as a director,&quot; Lenkowsky said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, nonprofits often have to consider donors&rsquo; actions when they give money. The stakes are usually higher when the nonprofit involves a political figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These are gifts not to Clinton herself but to the foundation that shares her name,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States&nbsp;remains allies with some of these countries, such as <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3584.htm\">Saudi&nbsp;Arabia</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uae-embassy.org/uae-us-relations\">United Arab Emirates</a> and <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5437.htm\">Qatar</a>, despite their poor record with human rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that Hillary Clinton has &quot;been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly...and countries that kill gays.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&#39;s comment oversimplifies donations to the Clinton Foundation to make a quick attack against his Democratic rival.&nbsp;He makes it sound as if Clinton personally received money from foreign governments with poor records on human rights. But political candidates cannot accept donations from&nbsp;foreign governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, several countries with harsh rules for women and that kill gays have contributed to the Clinton Foundation both before and after&nbsp;her tenure at the State Department.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-08T20:28:18.704329", "ruling_date": "2016-07-11T18:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Hillary Clinton take money from countries that treat women, gays poorly?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-hillary-clinton-take-money-countries-treat-wom", "ruling_link_text": "Foundation has, but not her directly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC15, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/full-speech-trump-holds-rally-at-veterans-memorial-coliseum\">FULL SPEECH: Trump holds rally at Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a>,&quot;
