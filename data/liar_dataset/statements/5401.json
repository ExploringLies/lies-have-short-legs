So we relied on state budget records and a small amount of background material the Chamber cited in its ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Allen took office in January 1994, he inherited an overall $14.7 billion budget for the fiscal year that started the previous July 1. At the end of his term, in January 1998, he left behind &nbsp;a $20.7 billion proposed budget for the fiscal year that started the following July 1. That means Allen endorsed $6 billion in additional spending when he was governor -- a 40.7 percent increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut looking at overall spending may be unfair. Slightly more than half of the outlays during Allen&rsquo;s years came from the non-general fund, over which a governor has limited control. The fund consists of earmarked revenues such as college tuition and federal highway grants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA better gauge, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/sep/12/george-allen/allen-says-he-reined-state-spending-governor/\">as we&rsquo;ve noted before</a>, comes from examining the general fund, which pays for public education, health programs and public safety. It&rsquo;s mostly supported by state income and sales taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe general fund was almost $6.8 billion when Allen took office. At the end of his term, he proposed a $9.9 billion general fund for the budget year beginning July 1, 1998. That means Allen endorsed $3.1 billion in additional general fund spending when he was governor -- a 45.6.percent rise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough the general fund growth under Allen may sound gigantic, it was about average for a Virginia governor. The general fund budget has grown by 479 percent over the last 30 years, from almost $2.7 billion in 1981 to almost $15.5 billion this fiscal year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany factors explain the expansion: population has grown, creating greater revenues and a greater demand for services; Medicaid costs have increased dramatically, often by 10 percent a year; and inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen tried to slow the growth by proposing a $2.1 billion tax cut in early 1995. The measure was opposed by the business community and defeated by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. After that point, Allen had little choice but to spend the revenues coming in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how does does the U.S. Chamber square the general fund increases with its claim that Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFine print in the Chamber&rsquo;s ad refers to a story in The Washington Post on Feb. 25, 1995, that was headlined &quot;Allen Announces Deal on Welfare.&quot; The article detailed an agreement Allen struck with lawmakers to require welfare recipients to gradually return to work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation, considered a key Allen accomplishment, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Department of Social Services estimated in 2007 that welfare reform saved the state $957 million over its first 12 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the Chamber is not basing its claim that Allen that cut spending and waste on the bottom line of the state budget. It is referring to a program that Allen cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen, while acknowledging that total spending increased during his administration, says he found savings by streamlining parts of Virginia government. In addition to welfare reform, he points a reduction in the state workforce and the repeal of many regulations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThroughout his campaign for governor and his term in office, Allen criticized the bureaucracy and the state regulations for wasting taxpayers&rsquo; dollars. As we noted in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/sep/03/george-allen/allen-says-he-substantially-cut-state-government-w/\">previous Truth-O-Meter item</a>, Allen trimmed the executive branch, which represents the bulk of state workers, by 10,000 employees, or 9 percent. But the state&rsquo;s reliance on private contractors also grew significantly during his administration. The state did not keep records that allow a bottom-line analysis of Allen&rsquo;s workforce policies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast August, we gave a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/sep/12/george-allen/allen-says-he-reined-state-spending-governor/\">False</a> rating to Allen&rsquo;s unqualified boast of &quot;reigning in&quot; state spending when he was governor. Spending continued its normal growth pattern during Allen&rsquo;s term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, the national Chamber of Commerce, in a TV ad, says &quot;Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support&quot; when he was governor. There is some qualification in this statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim does not square with the big picture left by Allen&rsquo;s administration. General fund spending rose by 45.6 percent from the budget Allen inherited in 1994 to the one left behind in 1998. It should be noted that Allen&rsquo;s major effort to control spending was thwarted by the Democratic-controlled legislature, and the growth under Allen was about average for a Virginia governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chamber, however, is focusing on a detail in the big picture. In the ad&rsquo;s fine print, the group backs its statement by citing welfare reform championed by Allen in 1995. The law passed with strong bipartisan support and is credited with saving Virginia &nbsp;$957 million over its first 12 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeyond the Chamber&rsquo;s footnote, Allen could legitimately claim to have saved the Commonwealth money through some of his actions to pare the state workforce and regulations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the claim is partially accurate, but omits the important point that bottom line spending went up significantly during the Allen years.
