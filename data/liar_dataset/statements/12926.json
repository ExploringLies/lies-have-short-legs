They actually approved a lower property tax rate of $1,800 per $100,000 of accessed property value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a lower tax rate, some homeowners may still pay more in taxes if their home is worth more, but it varies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s the assessed value on any given property that dictates whether someone&rsquo;s overall taxes increase or decrease,&quot; said Buckeye finance director Larry Price. &quot;She got her years wrong or just flat out missed it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, while Strauss did get a &quot;Champion of Big Government&quot; rating for calendar year 2015, from calendar year 2007 through calendar year 2015, he averaged a score of -1, or &quot;<a href=\"https://v6mx3476r2b25580w4eit4uv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CY2007-2015LGSCGscores04-07-2016.pdf\">Needs Much Improvement.</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in calendar year 2014, AFP actually gave him a &quot;Friend of the Taxpayer&quot; rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also examined the minutes for all the Buckeye City Council meetings in 2015 and found that Strauss voted against resolutions thought to be pro-government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2015, he voted against two resolutions for city employee raises, including one that would give raises to employees based on the city&rsquo;s financial scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By comparison, Gosar received <a href=\"http://afpscorecard.org/#member#G000565#house\">a perfect score</a> from AFP, as his congressional votes coincided with the group&rsquo;s position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palin said, &quot;Dr. Gosar&#39;s opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a &lsquo;Champion of Big Government&#39;&nbsp;for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s misleading and leaves out important context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opponent in question, Ray Strauss, did not vote to raise taxes that year while on the Buckeye City Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while the group did give him that rating in 2015, it wasn&#39;t a lifetime rating.&nbsp;Palin cherry-picks one year.
