The website includes a video clip of a speech Gonzalez gave at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should not have ostracized him, you didn&rsquo;t know this kid. Okay? We did.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, Gonzalez was responding to a tweet from President Donald Trump that implied people should have been more active in reporting the shooter&rsquo;s disturbing behavior before people died. The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/17/us/florida-student-emma-gonzalez-speech/index.html\">full video clip</a> showed Gonzalez talking about the shooter being mentally disturbed, but she never made any claims about bullying him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is Gonzalez&rsquo;s comment in full context:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/964110212885106689?lang=en\">one tweet</a> I would like to call attention to. &lsquo;So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again.&rsquo; We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn&#39;t know this kid. Okay, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no other evidence to suggest that Gonzalez bullied Cruz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article then refers to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edennnnnn/status/976556192318173184\">tweet </a>Gonzalez retweeted on March 27. The tweet from user @edennnnnn said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If bullying caused school shootings, you would see trans shooters, queer shooters, female shooters, POC shooters. Bullying does not cause school shootings; entitlement does. And white boys are the most entitled demographic by far.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project Republic described Gonzalez&rsquo;s retweet as sentiment to blaming &quot;white boys&rsquo; entitlement&quot; as the cause of all school shootings. But the tweet isn&rsquo;t that specific in blaming all school shootings on entitlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project Republic has no evidence to show that Gonzalez bullied Cruz; she didn&rsquo;t admit; and the retweet doesn&rsquo;t say what Project Republic said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-29T19:38:42.234668", "ruling_date": "2018-03-30T10:55:39", "ruling_headline": "No, Emma Gonzalez did not admit to bullying Parkland shooter at a rally ", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-emma-gonzalez-did-not-admit-bullying-parkland-s", "ruling_link_text": "Twisting words to make a false point", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Project Republic, <a href=\"http://www.projectrepublictoday.com/2018/03/28/emma-gonzalez-bullied-school-shooter-isnt-sorry-then-retweets-message-blaming-white-boys-entitlement-as-cause-of-all-school-shootings/\">Emma Gonzalez bullied school shooter, isn&rsquo;t sorry; then retweets message blaming &quot;white boys&rsquo; entitlement&quot; as cause of all school shootings</a>, March 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/17/us/florida-student-emma-gonzalez-speech/index.html\">Florida student Emma Gonzalez to lawmakers and gun advocates: &lsquo;We call BS&rsquo;</a>, fEB. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emma4Change\">Twitter,</a> Emma Gonzalez</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/edennnnnn\">Twitter,</a> Eden Cheung</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Project", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4259, "last_name": "Republic", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "project-republic", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/FAKENEWSSPEAKER.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4259/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Emma Gonzalez bullied school shooter, isn&rsquo;t sorry; then retweets message blaming &lsquo;white boys&rsquo; entitlement&rsquo; as cause of all school shootings&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "on a alternative news site", "statement_date": "2018-03-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
