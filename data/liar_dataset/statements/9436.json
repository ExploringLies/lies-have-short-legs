The former secretary of state and potential&nbsp;2016 presidential candidate has found herself trying to limit&nbsp;blowback to her claim that she and husband Bill were &quot;dead broke&quot; when they left the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She made the comment during an interview with ABC&rsquo;s Diane Sawyer. Sawyer pressed Clinton on a reported haul of $5 million in speaking fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have no reason to remember, but we came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea&#39;s education. It was not easy. Bill has worked really hard. And it&#39;s been amazing to me. He&#39;s worked very hard.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans called the claim laughable and the next day Clinton clarified, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-post-white-house-debt-working-hard/story?id=24064204\"><u>again on ABC</u></a>, that she and Bill had done very well over the past 14 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have a life experience that is clearly different in very dramatic ways from many Americans,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;But we also have gone through some of the same challenges many people have.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to take a closer look at Clinton&rsquo;s claim of being &quot;dead broke&quot; when their time in the White House ended after December 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Clintons&rsquo; balance sheet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?CID=N00000019\"><u>via the Open Secrets website</u></a>, provides a rough view of the balance between the couple&rsquo;s assets and liabilities. These forms only show amounts in broad ranges -- from $15,001 to $50,000, from $50,001 to $100,000 and so forth -- but under any set of assumptions, the Clintons were in the red, a problem driven by Bill Clinton&rsquo;s enormous legal bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their highest possible assets totaled about $1.8 million, while their lowest possible debts were nearly $2.3 million. The most optimistic scenario left them in a hole of about $500,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the federal disclosure form does not include homes used for personal use and the Clintons owned two. In 1999, they bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington, D.C. The price was $2.85 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While those homes had mortgages, which would increase the amount of the Clintons&#39; debt, the family also had equity in them. The <em>New York Times</em> reported that the Clintons put $855,000 down on the Washington house, for instance. That equity would have covered the low-end debt estimate of about $500,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Point being: Clinton&rsquo;s 2000 disclosure doesn&rsquo;t prove the Clintons&rsquo; liabilities exceeded their assets when they left the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s office for more details and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Were they dead broke?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this begs the question of whether someone who can afford to buy a $2.85 million house is &quot;dead broke.&quot; We reached two accounting professors at Ohio State University&rsquo;s Fisher College of Business, one of the top-ranked schools in the country. Assistant Professor Jeffrey Hoopes said to call the Clintons dead broke would be a stretch for how the term is commonly understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Almost any president leaving office can expect tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of future earnings as a result of their having been president,&quot; Hoopes said. &quot;Speaking, consulting, board positions, and so on, are all very lucrative.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Brian Mittendorf said a balance sheet of assets and liabilities simply doesn&rsquo;t paint a complete picture. Mittendorf compared the Clintons to a medical school graduate saddled with huge debts but with the prospect of a very hefty income down the line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While one can claim to be technically broke, creditors wouldn&#39;t take it as such as long as future income streams could cover the liabilities,&quot; Mittendorf said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2000, at least one large bank saw the Clintons through that lens. Whatever their balance sheet might have been, Citibank lent them $1.995 million to buy that house in Washington, D.C. This was a safe loan. By Feb. 5, 2001, Bill Clinton was commanding regular speaking fees of $125,000 or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton herself did quite well in 2001. The book publisher Simon and Schuster paid her $2.84 million in royalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2004, the Clintons had erased their debts and Hillary Clinton was ranked the 10th-wealthiest member of the Senate, with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton said she and Bill were in debt and dead broke when they left the White House. The public<strong> </strong>record shows that they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn&rsquo;t show that conclusively. More important, a balance sheet does not tell the full story and the experts we reached said the Clintons&rsquo; earning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks before they left the White House, the Clintons were able to muster a cash<strong> </strong>down payment of $855,000 and secure a $1.995 million mortgage. This hardly fits the common meaning of &quot;dead broke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly&nbsp;False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-10T18:01:47.775195", "ruling_date": "2014-06-10T18:18:14", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says she and Bill were 'dead broke'", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke", "ruling_link_text": "Not broke like regular folks", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4491774?4\"><u>Interview with Hillary Clinton</u></a>, June 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/06/09/the-clintons-left-the-white-house-in-debt-wait-what/\"><u>The Clintons say they left the White House in debt.
