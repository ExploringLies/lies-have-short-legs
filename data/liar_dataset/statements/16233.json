Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was running for reelection, he broke with fellow Democrats by voting to confirm President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough for some critics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorriseyWV/status/1048673350220963841\">tweet</a>, his opponent, Patrick Morrisey, wrote, &quot;Thanks to @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans in the Senate who confirmed Kavanaugh. Remember, Manchin refused to commit to Kavanaugh until AFTER the Senate had the votes. Manchin piled on &mdash; he had no courage and empowered the Schumer circus. #wvsen #wvpol.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin ended up defeating Morrisey, though by a more narrow margin than polls had indicated. Was Morrisey correct that Manchin refused to confirm Kavanaugh until after the Senate already had votes in Kavanaugh&rsquo;s favor? Manchin&rsquo;s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sept. 27, Christine Blasey Ford <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zVOkb3CdZ0\">accused</a> Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teens.. This allegation put Kavanaugh&rsquo;s nomination in jeopardy, and the Senate delayed a confirmation vote so the FBI could investigate the allegation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4RzLdxfuoE\">supported</a> the Senate delaying the vote, and he took his time before committing to a yes or no vote on the nomination. He only made his position public after the FBI investigation was completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, Manchin announced his intentions only after Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced that she would support becoming the 50th vote to confirm Kavanaugh. That would have been sufficient for a confirmation because Vice President Mike Pence could have broken a tie in Kavanaugh&rsquo;s favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin made the announcement on Oct. 5, saying in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sen_JoeManchin/status/1048300503099170817\">tweeted</a> press release at 3:54 p.m., &quot;I met with the nominee for over two hours, attended his hearings, spoke with constitutional experts, and heard from thousands of West Virginians.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7WTcx3QoAEJ1KEvYCneQHtbZwd93Pf-vM0NtZJj47_CVtHOrRdSLOsZMiLGMHirl7D4B9ottolUWAgpWalwi43ycBX6Ygt16r8tk4bm1Cqx_IjkJ0Fiywelc7KijRc2FHTGbXyfA\" style=\"border:none; height:303px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was &quot;within moments of&quot; Collins&rsquo; announcement, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/05/politics/collins-kavanaugh-vote-nomination-announcement/index.html\">CNN reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/04/manchin-kavanaugh-battle-867885\">Politico</a> wrote that &quot;it&rsquo;s clear Manchin doesn&rsquo;t want to be the 50th vote for Kavanaugh, but it seems like he&rsquo;d be OK with being the 51st or 52nd, barring any new developments.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey tweeted that Manchin &quot;refused to commit to Kavanaugh until AFTER the Senate had the votes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manchin waited until after Collins said she would become the 50th vote in support of Kavanaugh&rsquo;s nomination to announce his own decision to back him.
