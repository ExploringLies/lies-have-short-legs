Tom Cotton of Arkansas is challenging incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor, in a tight race that could decide which party controls the Senate. Like many other Republicans facing against incumbent Democrats, Cotton often attacks Pryor for voting in line with Obama&rsquo;s policies more often than not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the candidates&rsquo; first <a href=\"http://www.tomcotton.com/2014/10/first-debate/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>debate Oct. 13</u></a>, Cotton said, &quot;Sen.&nbsp;Pryor has said that President Obama doesn&rsquo;t have a lot to offer rural America and states like Arkansas. I agree. I just don&rsquo;t understand why he votes with him 93 percent of the time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cotton has made this claim and ones like it a lot throughout the campaign, while Pryor has touted a supposedly independent record. <em>National Journal</em>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/2013-vote-ratings\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2013 congressional vote rankings</u></a> landed Pryor right in the middle of the Senate, at 53rd most-liberal and 47th most-conservative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check out how often Pryor votes in line with Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Cotton&rsquo;s campaign, and they didn&rsquo;t get back to us. But these statistics typically come from CQ Roll Call, which tracks congressional data. Since 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, CQ has calculated presidential support in congressional votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its<a href=\"http://media.cq.com/blog/2013/02/member-voting-patterns/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> vote studies</u></a>, CQ editors select &quot;presidential support votes,&quot; based on clear statements the president or his spokespersons make on particular votes. Members&rsquo; presidential support scores reflect how often they vote in agreement with the president&rsquo;s position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s Pryor&rsquo;s presidential support rate since 2009, when Obama took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Year</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Presidential support rate</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>95 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>92 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>95 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>91 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>90 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pryor&#39;s votes&nbsp;have lined up with&nbsp;Obama&#39;s stated&nbsp;position on that vote between 90 and 95 percent of the time for the past five years.&nbsp;Cotton&rsquo;s figure -- 93 percent -- is right smack in the middle. (The average is 92.6 percent.) So it&rsquo;s pretty accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, Pryor supported the president the <em>least </em>among Senate Democrats, according to CQ. That year, Senate Democrats overall <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/graphics/weekly/2014/02/03/wr20140203-04prezsupport-cht2.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>voted with Obama 96 percent of the time</u></a> in 2013, which was the &quot;highest level of support given to the commander in chief from either party in at least six decades,&quot; according to CQ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that this measurement would also indicate how a member of Congress votes with their party -- given the partisan environment. But this is not strictly the case. Here&rsquo;s Pryor&rsquo;s voting record in terms of how often he voted with the Democratic Party since 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Year</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Party support rate</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>91 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>85 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>85 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>85 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>80 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he has voted with Obama at least 90 percent of the time, Pryor has voted with the Democratic Party less often, particularly in the past year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For contrast, Cotton -- who has only been in office as a representative for one year -- voted with Obama just 12 percent of the time in 2013.

They noted the <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/294571-senate-rejects-tougher-background-checks-on-gun-purchases\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate&rsquo;s rejection</u></a> of a gun control bill involving universal background checks, which Obama supported.

Pryor doesn&rsquo;t vote with the Democratic Party quite as often, though, and in 2013 his presidential support votes were lower than every other Senate Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cotton&rsquo;s number is on target based on the data, but Pryor has also opposed Obama on a few key issues.
