Chris Christie to big business and paints him as an enemy of education. A meme is an idea or concept shared via social media.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe meme declares, &quot;New Jersey&#39;s governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade,&quot; with a prominent picture of a dazed-looking Christie in the middle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe picture may not be the most flattering, but the claims in it are hard facts: New Jersey&rsquo;s governor did cut education by a significant amount, and his actions have resulted in tax break largesse for businesses.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s begin by reviewing the education funding claim.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie cut education funding, but not by $1.6 billion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe governor made two cuts to education in 2010 totaling about $1 billion to help close significant budget gaps. The New Jersey Education Law Center, a Newark-based school advocacy group, sued, claiming the cuts violated the law for giving aid to school districts, and put at-risk and poor students at an increased disadvantage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tUltimately, a judge agreed with the Education Law Center&rsquo;s challenge. The judge also found that New Jersey would have needed $1.6 billion to fully fund education in New Jersey in accordance with the state&rsquo;s funding law, and ordered the state to spend an additional $500 million on public education in poor districts the next year.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBottom line? Christie&rsquo;s cuts totaled $1 billion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNext, let&rsquo;s review the claim about corporate tax breaks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNew Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal think tank, released a report in April that the state has given $2.1 billion in tax breaks and grants to companies during the past three years that Christie&rsquo;s been in office. That exceeds the $1.2 billion in corporate tax breaks given the entire previous decade, according to figures from the state Economic Development Authority.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAt the time of the report&rsquo;s release, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said the group is &quot;simply not credible,&quot; and that figures from the EDA show that incentives have created more than 100,000 jobs since 1996.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhat Drewniak didn&rsquo;t do, however, was question the accuracy of the numbers in the report.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also worth noting that a month before the report came out, Christie told a commercial real estate group that his administration was on target to deliver $2.3 billion in business tax breaks and supports legislation reauthorizing corporate incentives.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNJPP used EDA numbers for its study, Deputy Director Jon Whiten said in an e-mail..</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNeither Drewniak nor Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts responded to requests for comment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA meme on the state AFL-CIO Facebook page claims, &quot;New Jersey&#39;s governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie actually cut $1 billion in state aid from education, not $1.6 billion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAs for corporate tax breaks, Christie himself has said his administration is on target to deliver $2.3 billion in benefits for business &ndash; and that&rsquo;s nearly double what was handed out in tax breaks in the decade before he took office.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe rate the meme&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/politifact_nj_state_afl-cios_f.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-22T17:42:51.567319", "ruling_date": "2013-05-23T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "NJ AFL-CIO claims Chris Christie cut education funding by $1.6B while giving out $2B in corporate tax breaks", "ruling_headline_slug": "afl-cio-claims-chris-christie-cut-ed-funding-16b-w", "ruling_link_text": "Give or take a billion", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-6d6302e3-ce31-9de9-137c-b4ed6eb1c8b1\">\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=518314934895716&amp;set=a.370651122995432.81896.348618661865345&amp;type=1\">New Jersey State AFL-CIO Facebook page</a>, accessed May 20 and 21, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tE-mail and phone interviews with Lee Sandberg, spokesman, <a href=\"http://www.njaflcio.org/\">New Jersey State AFL-CIO</a>, May 20 and 22, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/06/committee-our-childrens-future/television-ad-promotes-chris-christies-spending-cu/\">Television ad promotes Chris Christie&rsquo;s spending cuts, increased education funding</a>, Oct. 6, 2011, accessed May 21, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/11/jim-whelan/state-sen-jim-whelan-says-gov-chris-christie-slash/\">State Sen.
