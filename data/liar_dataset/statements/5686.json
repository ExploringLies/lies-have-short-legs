The number was accurate, but we rated that claim as Mostly False for the part of the statement where the governor said &quot;we&rsquo;ve created&quot; the jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the governor earned a rating of Mostly True in January when he said Ohio ranked 8th in the nation in job creation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow we asked Kasich&#39;s spokesman, Rob Nichols, his basis for saying Ohio was number one in job creation in February and number four over the previous year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe pointed to employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to the news release issued by the bureau when it posted new numbers on March 30 .<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In February,&quot; says the BLS release, &quot;nonfarm payroll employment increased in 42 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 8 states. The largest over-the-month increase in employment occurred in Ohio (up 28,300), followed by Texas and New York.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Ohio figure &nbsp;was the nation&#39;s &quot;largest statistically significant&quot; job gain, BLS said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(In terms of percentage increase in employment, the second category used by BLS, North Dakota ranked first, up 1.3 percent. But raw numbers have been the metric used consistently by the Kasich administration and the Kasich campaign before that.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe BLS release also lists the states that had &quot;statistically significant employment changes from February 2011 to February 2012.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe biggest gainer was Texas, which added 273,900 jobs, followed by New York and California. No. 4, adding 73,500 jobs, was Ohio.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Kasich&rsquo;s figures are accurate. And, putting them in context, he did not overreach when Cavuto asked if credit due to governor might be taken by President Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When economies get better, executives get credit for it,&quot; Kasich said. &quot;The fact is, does he benefit to some degree in Ohio from that? There`s no question that he does. Do I? Yes. Are we responsible for it? From our perspective out here, we have just taken on a lot of tough problems and created a better environment.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat part could be classified as political rhetoric, and we&rsquo;re not rating it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Kasich&rsquo;s statement &nbsp;about job creation rates is True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-05T11:26:12.713096", "ruling_date": "2012-04-05T14:00:00", "ruling_headline": "John Kasich says Ohio led all states for job creation in February", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-kasich-says-ohio-led-all-states-job-creation-", "ruling_link_text": "Federal stats make this claim work", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCQ Transcriptions, Fox News, Anchor Neil Cavuto with Gov.
