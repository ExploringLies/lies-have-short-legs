Scott Walker is framing his budget battle as a victory for Wisconsin&rsquo;s property tax payers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a July 7, 2011 <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Walker+column.doc\">news release and column</a>, Walker said a 60-year-old custodian told him a $500 property tax increase he experienced in 2010 will mess up his coming retirement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker said the man, who was not identified, told him, &quot;I will have to find a part-time job just to live normally.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor continued: &quot;Under our budget, the average property taxpayer will save $700. It is my hope that savings like this will help keep more people like that custodian safely in their homes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat claim of $700 savings caught our eye.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s budget featured tight property tax caps -- caps that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/559/freeze-property-taxes/\">fulfilled a campaign promise</a>, and would rein in growth. But there was no talk of a big reduction in property taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker spokesman Cullen Werwie said Walker did not mean to suggest people would see a real-dollar tax cut of $700 over their previous bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRather, Werwie said, Walker means they would pay $700 less over the two-year (2011-&rsquo;13) budget compared with what they would have without Walker&rsquo;s moves.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt best, that&rsquo;s highly confusing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEspecially since Walker juxtaposes the &quot;$700 savings&quot; claim with the story of one person&rsquo;s bill going up $500 the year before. In other spots where we found Walker using the $700 figure we found a similar lack of context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut under either approach, there are problems with Walker&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA bit of background first.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor years, the state has imposed property tax limits on local governments and school districts, resulting in a slowing of tax growth that somewhat reduced Wisconsin&rsquo;s high national ranking on property tax burden.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, in the two-year budget signed in June, Walker won support for much tighter property-tax controls -- even a virtual freeze on municipal levies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tight levy limits were important to lead to property tax relief. Walker&rsquo;s budget included large aid cuts to school districts and local units of government. If those officials didn&rsquo;t -- or couldn&rsquo;t based on in-place union contracts -- use tools to make employees pay more for pensions and health care, they could have raised property taxes to cover the difference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back up the governor&rsquo;s statement, Werwie pointed us to one page in a Department of Administration budget document from March 2011. It was part of Walker&rsquo;s budget proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe page shows <a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/debf/pdf_files/bib1113.pdf\">a </a><a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/debf/pdf_files/bib1113.pdf\">chart </a>estimating the property taxes on a median-valued home for the next two years under Walker&rsquo;s budget, compared to what they might have been under a different scenario.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The typical taxpayer will save a total of $736 over the biennium,&quot; the chart notes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo that&rsquo;s where the governor gets the $700 figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s take a closer look at the two scenarios Walker is comparing in order to make his savings claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe department, which constructs the state budget, provided us the assumptions behind the chart.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe problem was immediately obvious -- the chart, while useful in one respect, doesn&rsquo;t offer a clean &quot;old way&quot; vs. &quot;new way&quot; comparison that Walker would have needed to make the claim he did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo get that, you could compare what property taxes might have been under the old aid levels and a continuation of the Doyle-era tax limits -- vs. the estimated taxes under Walker-proposed limits and aid cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s old vs. new.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead, on the &quot;old&quot; (pre-Walker) side of the equation, the chart inserts one of Walker&rsquo;s own key proposals -- the big aid cut to local governments and schools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat has the effect of pushing up the property tax hike that &quot;might have been&quot; -- in part because it assumed that schools and local governments would almost tax to the maximum allowed to replace the lost aid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat makes the &quot;savings&quot; projection bigger.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe chart is not wrong. It&rsquo;s a useful cautionary illustration for lawmakers deciding how strong the levy limits needed to be to avoid big property tax increases in light of Walker&rsquo;s school aid cut plans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut its conclusion can&rsquo;t be used to make the kind of claim Walker makes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo such analysis has been published yet, based on what we heard from tax experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo sum up, Walker claimed the 2011-&rsquo;13 state budget will &quot;save&quot; the average homeowner $700 over two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf he meant a $700 tax cut compared to the past bills, that&rsquo;s not in the cards at all. The state&rsquo;s nonpartisan <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/2011-13%20Budget/2011_07_05%20property%20tax%20estimates.pdf\">Legislative Fiscal Bureau projects </a>the typical homeowner would see a $55 increase in two years compared with 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd even if he meant $700 less of an increase, his assertion is not based on an apples-to-apples comparison of his budget vs. the old law. The real figure is not yet known, but we do know that the approach Walker cited was designed in a way that puffs up the &quot;savings.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim, with its shorthand presentation, rates as False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-15T16:40:38.339993", "ruling_date": "2011-07-18T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
