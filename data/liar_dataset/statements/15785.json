They&rsquo;re going to try to label me, someone who&rsquo;s been a small-town supervisor, who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had, who is an Eagle Scout, who is a father and a husband and a dad, that I&rsquo;m some type of radical because I have a D next to my name.
