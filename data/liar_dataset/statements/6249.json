Or maybe it&rsquo;s just Coke? <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile in bubbly debate over what to call soft drinks -- your PolitiFact Oregon staff does not agree on this -- a colleague of ours suggested a potential fact check that anyone might find intriguing, no matter what they call their carbonated beverage of choice. You&rsquo;ve probably seen the &quot;Sugar Packs&quot; ads around Multnomah County, put there by the Health Department as part of a healthy living and anti-obesity campaign that started in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s the one with a pile of packets of white sugar draining into a 20-ounce bottle of generic cola. &quot;Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar,&quot; <a href=\"http://multco-itstartshere.org/sites/default/files/PDF/Sugar%20Packs%20Poster%20-%2011X17_ENG-%20Final.pdf\">the ad states</a>. &quot;All those extra calories can bring on obesity, diabetes and heart disease.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSixteen packets? Our collective stomachs cramped. Our teeth ached. We swallowed our distaste and started checking.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSoda-sleuthing turned out to be quite easy, namely because there&rsquo;s a lot of pop in a newsroom. In fact, we found more than a dozen empties within spitting distance. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola regular, we learned, contains 39 grams of sugar, usually from high-fructose corn syrup in the United States. A 20-ounce bottle would then contain 65 grams of sugar. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/coverage-in-the-media/hu-high-fructose-corn-syrup/index.html\">Corn syrup is not the same as white table sugar</a>, but the county is talking equivalents. A packet of table sugar as shown in the ad is equal <a href=\"http://www.chsugar.com/consumer/white_granulated.html\">to about a teaspoon, or about 4 grams of sugar</a>. So, indeed, there are at least 16 packs of sugar in every 20-ounce bottle of regular cola.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no arguing that that&rsquo;s a large chunk of sweet. The <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Sugars-and-Carbohydrates_UCM_303296_Article.jsp\">American Heart Association recommends no more than </a>nine teaspoons -- nine packets -- of added sugar a day for adult men. For women, it&rsquo;s six.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut just for the fun of it -- no, we&rsquo;re not on a sugar high -- we wanted to know what else could contain the equivalent of 16 packets of granulated white. And bingo: A <a href=\"http://www.jambajuice.com/component/nutfacts/type/11\">16-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry </a>contains 60 grams of sugar. &nbsp;A <a href=\"http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnutrition/nutritionfacts.pdf\">12-ounce Chocolate McCafe shake from McDonald&rsquo;s </a>has 76 grams.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Starbucks Grande non-fat, no-whip <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages/caramel-frappuccino-blended-coffee#size=11002656&amp;milk=61&amp;whip=NA\">Caramel Frappucino Blended Beverage </a>contains 59 grams of sugar, although to be fair, the drink also includes 4 grams of nutritious protein. The <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/menu/food/bakery/iced-lemon-pound-cake?foodZone=9999\">iced lemon pound cake</a> contains 46 grams of sugar -- but then, all you adults knew that -- and PolitiFact Oregon has fallen into tangential research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to the point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe figure children don&rsquo;t usually indulge in diet sodas, which are made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and not with corn syrup or sugar. We&rsquo;re told by a beverage trade publication that 12-ounce cans are the top sellers -- but a 20-ounce bottle doesn&rsquo;t seem out of line in this age of super-sized drinks and Double Big Gulps.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s available in our environment,&quot; said Sonia Manhas, who manages the program for the county.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter all, McDonald&rsquo;s markets a 16-ounce soda as a <a href=\"http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/getnutrition/nutritionfacts.pdf\">small-sized soft drink and a 12-ounce drink as child-sized. </a>We figure parents are smart enough to figure out the sugar-gram-to-cola-ounce ratio themselves. The smaller the drink, the fewer the sugar packets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll this really means is that we find the county&rsquo;s statement accurate. We rate it True. And that&rsquo;s the unsugar-coated truth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-11T19:52:16.310729", "ruling_date": "2012-07-11T16:48:25", "ruling_headline": "Did your kid just drink 16 packs of sugar?
