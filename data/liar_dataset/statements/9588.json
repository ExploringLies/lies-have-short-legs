Saxby Chambliss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kingston&rsquo;s runoff opponent, wealthy businessman David Perdue, has attacked Kingston on YouTube and in television ads for voting for Obama&rsquo;s &quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot; program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each man is billing himself as the &quot;true conservative&quot; in the race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out whether Kingston voted for Cash for Clunkers and, if so, whether that makes him less of a fiscal conservative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.The Car Allowance Rebate System, commonly referred to as Cash for Clunkers, was a federal voucher program that encouraged consumers to replace less-fuel-efficient vehicles with newer, more-fuel-efficient models. Officials said the goal was to boost auto sales and stimulate the economy while the program ran from July 1, 2009, to Aug. 24, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes sense that Perdue would criticize a vote for Cash for Clunkers. Though the program was touted as a means to bolster Detroit&rsquo;s carmakers, it unintentionally increased the market share for Japanese and Korean automakers, according to a<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/08/26/retire-us-usa-clunkers-sales-idUSTRE57P5C220090826\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Reuters report in 2009</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/10/cash-for-clunkers-evaluation-gayer\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>October analysis</u></a> by the Brookings Institute&rsquo;s Ted Gayer and Emily Parker found that the program provided a short-term boost in vehicle sales but was extremely inefficient in increasing jobs and decreasing total emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia residents requested $70 million in vouchers under the program, the 13th-highest participation rate in the nation, according to the Brookings Institute report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress originally appropriated $1 billion to the program but added an additional $2 billion when it ran out of money within a month. And Cash for Clunkers became a good-intentioned but runaway government program that conservatives love to rail on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did Kingston vote for Cash for Clunkers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s more complicated than a straight yes or no answer. It&rsquo;s No. And yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kingston did not vote to fund Cash for Clunkers initially, according to the legislative tracking service GovTrack. He cast &quot;No&quot; votes on bills on<a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2009/h314\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>June 9</u></a> and<a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2009/h348\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>June 16</u></a> that carried the framework of the program in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he voted in favor of putting the extra $2 billion into the program a month later when it was clearly foundering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Greg Dolan, a spokesman for Kingston, for an explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Once the program was authorized, Rep. Kingston approved moving funds from the grant program that spawned Solyndra to the slightly-less-wasteful Cash-for-Clunkers,&quot; Dolan wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solyndra was a solar energy company that drew public ire after going bankrupt despite taking a $535 million loan guarantee under the president&rsquo;s 2009 stimulus program for &quot;commercially available technologies,&quot; according to<a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2009/h682\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>FactCheck.org</u></a>. The $2 billion increase in Cash for Clunkers came from the same pot of money that had previously funded Solyndra &mdash; the<a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3435enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3435enr.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So from Kingston&rsquo;s perspective, he was voting to move money from one fiscal evil to a lesser evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dolan added in another email that there was no House vote that would have allowed the money to return to the general fund or go to a more efficient program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary: Kingston, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, did vote to provide $2 billion to Cash for Clunkers after it ran through $1 billion in its first month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kingston did not vote for the program initially. His office says that the decision to further fund Cash for Clunker was made to cut funds from a more wasteful government program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Perdue&rsquo;s statement that Kingston voted for &quot;Obama&rsquo;s Cash for Clunkers&quot; as Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-11T17:12:17.897440", "ruling_date": "2014-07-14T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Perdue omits detail in Cash for Clunkers claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "perdue-omits-detail-cash-clunkers-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Obama program at center of attack", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Greg Dolan, spokesman for U.S. Rep.
