One tit-for-tat war has broken out in North Carolina, where the Senate Majority PAC, a pro-Democratic group, has publicized two-year-old dirt from the office of Thom Tillis, the state&rsquo;s House Speaker and leading contender for the GOP Senate nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan,<strong> </strong>released an ad on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPUY5vv5W-Q\"><u>April 15</u></a> reminding viewers of how two Tillis staffers -- one of whom he shared an apartment with -- got caught having affairs with lobbyists just days apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Thom Tillis&rsquo; reaction?&quot; the narrator said. &quot;He claimed he was surprised by his roommate&rsquo;s affair, but then rewarded both aides with taxpayer-paid bonuses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad also specified that the staffers -- Charles Thomas and Amy Hobbs -- resigned. Tillis&rsquo; Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, released a <a href=\"http://www.wral.com/news/state/nccapitol/audio/13575155/\"><u>similar radio ad</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, Tillis&rsquo; campaign offered a decidedly<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0I5tNEwI_M\"><u>different take</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Seen those ads attacking Thom Tillis?&quot; the narrator said. &quot;They&rsquo;re false. Tillis <em>fired </em>the staffers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who&rsquo;s right here? PolitiFact concludes that the Senate Majority PAC&rsquo;s description of the situation -- not Tillis&rsquo; -- is closer to the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happened in 2012</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>News &amp; Observer</em>, a newspaper based in Raleigh, N.C., <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/04/27/2027766/charles-thomas-nc-speakers-top.html\"><u>reported</u></a> that Charles Thomas, Tillis&rsquo; chief of staff and roommate, resigned in April 2012 after his affair with a lobbyist was caught on video. Less than one week later, policy analyst Amy Hobbs resigned after an <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/01/2036675/second-tillis-staffer-resigns.html\"><u>affair of her own was exposed</u></a>, the paper reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tillis then <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/17/2072083/house-speaker-tillis-defends-payments.html\"><u>offered</u></a> the two former staffers a payment of one month&rsquo;s salary -- $12,500 for Thomas and $6,833.33 for Hobbs. The listed purpose was &quot;payment in lieu of notice,&quot; a term he took from Wikipedia that referred to a British policy. Under North Carolina law, Tillis wasn&rsquo;t obligated to pay either staffer a month&rsquo;s salary upon resignation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/17/2072083/house-speaker-tillis-defends-payments.html\"><u>defending his decision</u></a> to pay staffers, Tillis said, &quot;I stand by my decision to accept their resignation while recognizing the difficult transition period they are now entering.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, Tillis at the time did not claim that he had fired the staffers -- only accepted their resignations. This supports the pro-Democratic ad, and clashes with what Tillis&rsquo; 2014 ad claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, after our colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker expressed skepticism about Tillis&rsquo; ad, his office now appears to be backing off the term &quot;fired.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Speaker Tillis initiated the action that resulted in the termination of employment. He asked for their resignations,&quot; Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s closer to Tillis&rsquo; initial phrasing, that he &quot;accepted&quot; the resignations, but it&rsquo;s still not the same thing as &quot;fired.&quot; And in any case, Tillis&rsquo; response ad was not aired with the &quot;forced resignations&quot; terminology that Tillis&rsquo; office began using after the fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tillis&rsquo; ad called a pro-Democratic ad &quot;false&quot; for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to &quot;resign.&quot; But the news coverage at the time painted a different picture -- he accepted their resignations. This generally supports the Democratic ad&rsquo;s description, so we rate Tillis&rsquo; claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-25T17:13:39.311182", "ruling_date": "2014-04-25T17:24:52", "ruling_headline": "Thom Tillis, Senate Majority PAC disagree on disgraced staffers", "ruling_headline_slug": "thom-tillis-senate-majority-pac-disagree-disgraced", "ruling_link_text": "He accepted their resignations", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Jordan Shaw, Thom Tillis campaign spokesman, April 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Ty Matsdorf, Senate Majority PAC spokesman, April 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2014/04/tillis-response-ad-cries-false/\"><u>Tillis response ad cries &lsquo;false,&rsquo;</u></a> &quot; April 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/23/a-claim-of-false-when-the-ad-is-basically-true/\"><u>A claim of &lsquo;false&rsquo; when the ad is basically true</u></a>,&quot; April 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kay Hagan for Senate, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kayhagan.com/release/tillis-tries-rewrite-history-new-ad/\"><u>Tillis tries to rewrite history in new ad</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>News &amp; Observer</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/04/27/2027766/charles-thomas-nc-speakers-top.html\"><u>Charles Thomas, N.C. speaker&rsquo;s top aide, linked to lobbyist</u></a>,&quot; April 27, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>News &amp; Observer</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/17/2072083/house-speaker-tillis-defends-payments.html\"><u>House speaker Tillis defends payments to ex-staffers</u></a>,&quot; May 17, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>News &amp; Observer</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/01/2036675/second-tillis-staffer-resigns.html\"><u>Second Tillis staffer admits to inappropriate relationship with a lobbyist</u></a>,&quot; May 1, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>News &amp; Observer</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/05/17/2069393/speakers-staffers-receive-a-month.html\"><u>Speaker&rsquo;s staffers receive a month of pay after resignations</u></a>,&quot; May 17, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email interviews with Sadie Weiner, Kay Hagan campaign spokeswoman, April 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate Majority PAC, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPUY5vv5W-Q\"><u>Apartment</u></a>,&quot; April 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thom Tillis, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0I5tNEwI_M\"><u>Meddling</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WRAL, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wral.com/news/state/nccapitol/audio/13575155/\"><u>Hagan radio ads</u></a>,&quot; April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WRAL, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wral.com/senate-majority-pac-uses-staffer-scandal-against-tillis/13571270/\"><u>Senate Majority PAC uses staffer scandal against Tillis</u></a>,&quot; April 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WRAL, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wral.com/news/state/nccapitol/story/11115048/\"><u>Tillis defends severance payments for disgraced staffers</u></a>,&quot; May 17, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "House Speaker and U.S. Senate candidate", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Thom", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "North Carolina", "id": 2642, "last_name": "Tillis", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "thom-tillis", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/SenThomTillisPF.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "North Carolina", "edition": "North Carolina", "edition_slug": "north-carolina", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 58, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The North Carolina Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/58/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2642/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://thomtillis.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says a pro-Democratic ad is &quot;false&quot; for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to &quot;resign.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV ad", "statement_date": "2014-04-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
