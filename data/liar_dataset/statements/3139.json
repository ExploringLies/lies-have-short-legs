Last summer, as is my custom, I walked over to the Republican booth. The differences between the two parties couldn&#39;t be better illustrated than what I encountered,&quot; she wrote. &quot;While we were passing out free ice water, the Republicans were raffling off an AR-15 assault rifle.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA reader suggested PolitiFact Oregon take this on, and we found the topic interesting enough to tackle. Is a semiautomatic AR-15 an assault rifle? And were members of the Republican Party raffling one off at the Oregon State Fair?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Greg Leo, our go-to man at GOP state party headquarters, and asked about the rifle raffle. The state party spokesman said, &quot;It is true.&quot; How we love easy confirmations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeo went on to explain that the raffle was a fundraiser to benefit the Marion County Republican Central Committee. The state fair was just one of the locations where people could buy a $5 raffle ticket, and the rifle (.223 caliber) was not on site. The winner was directed to a dealer, who processed the paperwork and handled the transaction. Gun raffles, apparently, are not uncommon. The Oregon Firearms Federation is in the midst of raffling off five AR-15 rifles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, is it accurate to call an AR-15 an &quot;assault rifle&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTechnically speaking, Kevin Starrett of the <a href=\"http://oregonfirearms.org/faq/\">Oregon Firearms </a><a href=\"http://oregonfirearms.org/faq/\">Federation </a>says, it&rsquo;s not an assault rifle because an assault rifle must be able to switch between semiautomatic -- one bullet with each trigger pull -- and fully automatic machine-gun style modes. The AR-15, in this case, is a semiautomatic only. Genuine assault rifles are hard to get in the United States, outside the military.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, look up the term &quot;AR-15 assault rifle&quot; online and you&rsquo;ll find that even firearms sites describe the AR-15 as an assault rifle. When an unnamed man showed up with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at an Obama event in Phoenix nearly two years ago, news media used both &quot;assault weapon&quot; and &quot;assault rifle&quot; to describe the firearm. (CNN <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-18/politics/obama.protest.rifle_1_protester-assault-rifle-obama-event?_s=PM:POLITICS\">here</a>; MSNBC picking up AP <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32457652/ns/politics-white_house/\">here</a>.) The Associated Press Stylebook says the correct term is assault weapon, not assault rifle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn any case, fans say the AR-15 is terrific for hunting and target shooting; it&rsquo;s versatile and precise. (Fashionable, too. Look online to find a Pepto pink Hello Kitty version.) There&rsquo;s a quibble with the definition of &quot;assault rifle,&quot; but it&rsquo;s a small one.
