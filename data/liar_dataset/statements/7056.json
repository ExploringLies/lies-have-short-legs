Paul Ryan&rsquo;s controversial plan to reform Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother case for the Flip-O-Meter, which tests whether candidates have changed their position. As usual, we&rsquo;re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch, just whether the candidate has been consistent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the 2012 race, Thompson has ripped Baldwin for failing to propose a solvency plan for Medicare. Baldwin, in turn, has tried at every turn to link the former governor to Ryan&rsquo;s plan, which critics paint as &quot;ending Medicare as we know it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s &nbsp;<a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pathtoprosperity2013.pdf\">&quot;Path to Prosperity&quot;</a> budget resolution in 2012 -- the latest in a series of similar fiscal plans he&rsquo;s released in recent years -- included proposed changes in tax policy and entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s plan, which is nearly identical to Mitt Romney&rsquo;s, allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice. They can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCritics call this a &quot;voucher&quot; plan that could leave seniors dipping deeper into their own pockets, while Ryan says it&rsquo;s a &quot;premium support&quot; plan that will lower health care costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s look at Thompson&rsquo;s statements and actions:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>October 2011: </strong>Thompson, already an unofficial Senate candidate, says an <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/119960329.html\">earlier version of Ryan&rsquo;s budget plan</a>, this one in 2011, was &quot;on the right track&quot;. But unlike Ryan in that earlier plan, Thompson makes clear he wanted to give people under 55 a choice of staying on traditional Medicare or not when they reached retirement age. Thompson did not have a formal plan at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson says those who chose the traditional system would pay higher-out-of-pocket costs than seniors pay now because the system &quot;is going broke.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>March 29, 2012: </strong>The House <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74651.html\">approves Ryan&rsquo;s budget plan </a>on a 228-191 partisan vote. The plan&rsquo;s Medicare proposal -- modified from Ryan&rsquo;s earlier plan -- offered the choice of using a government payment for private insurance or for a plan akin to traditional Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>May 11-13, 2012: </strong>At the Republican Party state convention, Thompson endorses Ryan&rsquo;s 2013 budget plan as a whole. The plan included the Medicare changes, allowing beneficiaries a choice. &quot;I will pass Paul Ryan&rsquo;s budget plan in the U.S. Senate,&quot; he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqGr2q5qCV4\">says</a>. &quot;It is the right plan, at the right time, for America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the &quot;deficit reduction&quot; section of his <a href=\"http://tommyforwisconsin.com/issues/spending/\">campaign website</a>, Thompson says he &quot;fully and wholeheartedly endorses Paul Ryan&rsquo;s Path to Prosperity and will take all necessary steps to ensure the U.S. Senate takes up the plan. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It makes Social Security solvent, preserves Medicare for our most needy seniors, maintains a safety net for the poor and provides for sufficient defense to protect our security,&quot; Thompson says on the site. It adds: the plan &quot;emanates from Wisconsin and the values we hold dear.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson, the site says, would have &quot;additional entitlement, tax and budget reforms to add to Paul Ryan&rsquo;s plan&quot; during the campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>August 13, 2012:</strong> A Thompson radio ad after Ryan&rsquo;s selection as Romney&rsquo; vice presidential nominee says Thompson would be the 51st vote to pass Ryan&rsquo;s 2013 budget plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>August 14, 2012:</strong> Thompson wins a four-way GOP primary election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Sept. 28, 2012:</strong> During his first debate with Baldwin, Thompson briefly mentions a new wrinkle: People who opt not to stay in Medicare would be put in the health plan that federal employees, including members of Congress, are in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If it&rsquo;s good enough for the Congress, why isn&rsquo;t it good enough for the seniors,&quot; Thompson asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Oct. 5, 2012</strong>: Appearing at the Milwaukee Press Club Newsmaker luncheon, Thompson<br />\r\n\tpointedly says his Medicare plan now is &quot;different than Ryan&rsquo;s,&quot; again noting the federal employee plan option. Thompson says his plan would make the changes for those under 55 in 2020. The timeline in Ryan&rsquo;s plan is under 55 in 2023.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Oct. 19, 2012</strong>: Thompson told the <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/thompson-admits-he-doesn-t-know-if-medicare-plan-would/article_bb836034-1a33-11e2-988c-0019bb2963f4.html\">Wisconsin State Journal </a>editorial board of his new plan:<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is a plan by Paul Ryan.
