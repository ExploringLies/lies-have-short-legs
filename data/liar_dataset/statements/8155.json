That&rsquo;s 83.4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If I were a car thief, I&rsquo;d move to St. Petersburg,&quot; said Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, when told of the numbers. Scafidi said the percentage might be a &quot;high-water mark&quot; in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past several years, car technology has made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. Many new cars have <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-transponder-keys.htm\"><u>transponder keys</u></a>, which means someone can&rsquo;t unlock or start the car unless the key fob is close to the vehicle. As a result, St. Petersburg has seen a 70 percent drop in auto thefts over the past decade, Harmon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, people leaving their keys in their cars has become an increasing source of car thefts in the city. The thefts are crimes of opportunity, so 96 percent of cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas. Most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models. People are just capitalizing on careless driver mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/Consumer+Advisory:+Vehicle+Thefts+Increase+in+the+Summer+Months+%E2%80%93+NHTSA+Offers+Safety+Tips+for+Car+Owners\"><u>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</u></a>, 40 to 50 percent of auto thefts nationwide are due to keys in the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just lock your cars, people. As Harmon said, &quot;It&rsquo;s not rocket science.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One other note: It&rsquo;s technically illegal to leave your car unattended and running. So not only do you run the risk of having your car stolen, the police could issue you a ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foster said that 60 percent of car thefts occur because the owner left keys inside the vehicle. In St. Petersburg this year, it&rsquo;s actually 83.4 percent. An expert said that might be tops in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specific number aside, Foster&rsquo;s point that many auto thefts can easily be avoided is 100 percent on the mark. We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-14T14:14:53.472320", "ruling_date": "2013-08-14T14:41:58", "ruling_headline": "60 percent of St. Petersburg car thefts due to keys left in car, mayor says", "ruling_headline_slug": "60-percent-st-petersburg-car-thefts-due-keys-left-", "ruling_link_text": "St. Pete isn't winning a commonsense award", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Derrell Lyles, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Aug. 12, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Department of Law Enforcement, &quot;County and Municipal Offense Data,&quot; various years</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Mayor Bill Foster, Aug. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Charles Harmon, St. Petersburg Police Chief, Aug. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, Aug. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, &quot;Vehicle Theft Prevention,&quot; May 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/Consumer+Advisory:+Vehicle+Thefts+Increase+in+the+Summer+Months+%E2%80%93+NHTSA+Offers+Safety+Tips+for+Car+Owners\"><u>Vehicle Thefts Increase in the Summer Months &ndash; NHTSA Offers Safety Tips for Car Owners</u></a>,&quot; July 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St. Petersburg Police Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.stpete.org/police/releases/may13/05-22-13-drop-unit.pdf\"><u>St. Petersburg Police Department DROP Unit&rsquo;s First Initiative is to Prevent Auto Thefts</u></a>,&quot; May 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WiseGEEK, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-transponder-keys.htm\"><u>What Are Transponder Keys?</u></a>&quot; accessed Aug. 13, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Mayor, St. Petersburg", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 2371, "last_name": "Foster", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "bill-foster", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/foster.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2371/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in (St. Petersburg) are caused by people leaving their keys in the car.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a mayoral forum", "statement_date": "2013-08-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
