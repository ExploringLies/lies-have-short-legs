PolitiFact Ohio rated a claim about his missing work because he was traveling, raising campaign money as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/oct/04/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-ad-claims-josh-mandel-raised-campaig/\" target=\"blank\">Half True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow Mandel, the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, is airing a statewide <a href=\"http://joshmandel.com/video/2012/09/josh-mandel-ad-different-set-rules\" target=\"blank\">television ad</a> that says Brown is ignoring his official duties. The ad claims that Brown and other politicians in Washington &quot;think they can live by a different set of rules,&quot; and dings Brown for missing more than 350 votes in Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;With 400,000 unemployed, we need a Senator who shows up to work,&quot; says the ad&rsquo;s announcer, as the TV screen shows an empty chair. &nbsp;&quot;Sherrod Brown missed over 350 official votes. When he finally showed up, voted to raise his own pay six times. Sherrod Brown, living by different rules than us.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact decided to look at the ad&rsquo;s suggestion that Brown has not shown up for work and its claim that he missed over 350 official votes. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://joshmandel.com/news/2012/09/press-release-josh-mandel-releases-new-tv-ad-different-set-rules\">new release</a> that announced the ad&rsquo;s launch said Mandel&rsquo;s campaign obtained its statistics from the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/sherrod_brown/400050\">GovTrack website</a>. The news release also mentioned a fact missing from the ad that puts the missed votes in better perspective - they occurred over a period of more than 19 years, starting when Brown entered the U.S. House of Representatives in January 1993. A visit to the GovTrack website indicates there have been more than 10,000 recorded votes in that period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe largest number of Brown&rsquo;s missed votes - 83 - occurred in 2000. He missed 13.7 percent of that year&rsquo;s votes after suffering broken ribs and vertebrae in a car accident in Knox County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown spent more than a week in Mansfield MedCentral Hospital after the Jan. 30 crash, and missed occasional votes throughout the year because of follow-up medical treatments. For months after the crash, Brown wore an odd-looking plastic back brace around the U.S. Capitol. Then-President Clinton told Brown the brace made him resemble &quot;a Roman soldier in a 1960s movie.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown&rsquo;s second highest year for missed votes was 2006, the year of his successful U.S. Senate race against incumbent GOP Sen. Mike DeWine. He missed 51 votes that year. Thirty-four of them were in its third quarter, the height of campaign season.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince he joined the U.S. Senate in 2007, GovTrack indicates that Brown has missed 21 out of 1779 votes - a 98.8 percent attendance record. This year, he hasn&rsquo;t missed any votes. In 2011, he missed three. In 2010, he didn&rsquo;t miss any.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked why Mandel&rsquo;s ad didn&rsquo;t provide the context that Brown&rsquo;s missed votes occurred over nearly two decades, Mandel spokesman Travis Considine said its claims are &quot;factual,&quot; and observed that Brown&rsquo;s missed vote rate was higher than the congressional median. The GovTrak website says &nbsp;the median rate of missed votes for all members of Congress is 2.5 percent, while Brown&rsquo;s rate is 3 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Why is it OK for Democrats to criticize Treasurer Mandel on meeting attendance but it&rsquo;s not OK &nbsp;to question why Senator Brown missed more than 350 votes?&quot; Considine asked in an email. &quot;Are you employing a &quot;different set of rules&quot; for Brown and Mandel? &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown&rsquo;s campaign responded to the ad with a news release that claimed Mandel is &quot;desperately trying to distract from his own appalling attendance record&quot; by attacking Brown. It said Brown&rsquo;s voting record would have been better if not for the car crash, and the fact that he had to care for his dying mother in 2009, a year when records show that Brown missed eight votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is an element of truth in Mandel&rsquo;s claim: The ad correctly says that Brown has missed over 350 official votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it omits critical facts that would convey a different impression. It doesn&rsquo;t mention those missed votes were spread over more than 19 years that includes Brown&rsquo;s time in the U.S. House of Representatives and during that time more than 10,000 votes occurred.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown&rsquo;s voting attendance record throughout his congressional career - including time missed because of car crash injuries - is actually 96.5 percent. As a U.S. Senator, his attendance record is nearly 99 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKnowing those facts, and that Brown missed 351 out of 10,074 votes since January of 1993, would give a listener a different impression.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the Mandel campaign ad rates Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-09T18:29:53.868996", "ruling_date": "2012-10-10T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Josh Mandel dings Sherrod Brown for missing 350 votes, says Ohio needs a senator who shows up to work", "ruling_headline_slug": "josh-mandel-dings-sherrod-brown-missing-350-votes-", "ruling_link_text": "350 votes out of more than 10,000", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAssociated Press, <a href=\"http://www.cantonrep.com/newsnow/x690034312/Ohio-treasurer-a-no-show-at-deposit-board-meetings\">Ohio Treasurer a no-show at deposit board meetings,</a>Jan. 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Democratic Party Press Release, <a href=\"http://ohiodems.org/news/clippings/josh-mandel-thumbs-his-nose-at-ohio-taxpayers-yet-again-blows-off-14th-straight-board-of-deposit-meeting/\">Josh Mandel thumbs his nose at Ohio taxpayers yet again, blows off 14th straight Board of Deposit meeting</a>, Feb. 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSherrod Brown television ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWmPUglB-SQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Meetings</a>,&quot; May 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJosh Mandel television ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://joshmandel.com/video/2012/09/josh-mandel-ad-different-set-rules\">Different Set of Rules</a>&quot; &nbsp;Sept. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSherrod Brown television ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=CRQCgd8x98E\">Liar, Liar</a>,&quot; Sept. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJosh Mandel for Senate Press Release, <a href=\"http://joshmandel.com/news/2012/09/press-release-josh-mandel-releases-new-tv-ad-different-set-rules\">Josh Mandel releases new TV ad &quot;Different Set of Rules</a>,&quot; Sept. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSherrod Brown for Senate Press Release, Ad Watch: Josh Mandel&rsquo;s most ridiculous and misleading attack ad yet, Sept. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails with Mandel spokesman Travis Considine, Sept. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Brown spokesman Justin Barasky, Sept. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovTrack.us <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWmPUglB-SQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\">page on U.S. Sen.
