Lloyd Doggett&rsquo;s smiling face appears on a mailer sent out by a group advocating voter approval of a City of Austin rail proposition on the November 2014 ballot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We noticed a not-so-happy message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t let the Tea Party fool you,&quot; says a headline below the photo of the Democratic congressman from Austin on the placard mailed to voters by <a href=\"http://www.letsgoaustin.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Let&rsquo;s Go Austin</u></a>, a group that favors the proposal to spend $1 billion on a light rail line and roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doggett goes on to say: &quot;Proposition 1 is a smart investment in Austin&rsquo;s future.&quot; Below, he extolls the spending plan and then says: &quot;The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the misleading campaign against Prop. 1, but don&rsquo;t you buy it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mailer doesn&rsquo;t say how opponents have been &quot;misleading.&quot; Setting aside that characterization, we wondered if Doggett was right about the Austin Tea Party and a conservative millionaire leading the &quot;no&quot; campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Oct. 8, 2014, <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://shar.es/10W2zz\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news story</u></a> on spending by forces for or against the proposal didn&rsquo;t mention tea-party groups while identifying Citizens Against Rail Taxes as the major group working against approval and briefly mentioning Our Rail, which the story described as opposing the proposal and preferring a different rail route. According to the story, Citizens Against Rail Taxes had raised nearly $279,000 through late September 2014 from 13 donors including the retired high-tech executive serving as the group&rsquo;s treasurer, Jim Skaggs, who the story personally credited with giving $50,000. Our Rail had raised $760, the story said</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doggett, asked the basis of his claim, told us via spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale that Skaggs has supported &quot;ultra-conservatives&quot; like Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and state Sen. Donna Campbell of New Braunfels. &quot;Surely,&quot; Doggett also said by email, &quot;the Austin Tea Party doesn&rsquo;t deny its active opposition to Prop. 1.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynda Rife, campaign manager for Let&rsquo;s Go Austin, separately confirmed by email Doggett was referring to the Austin Tea Party, which recommended voters oppose the proposition in an Oct. 19, 2014, <a href=\"http://myemail.constantcontact.com/ATX-Voters-Guide.html?soid=1102956897086&amp;aid=Xn2xf7QToD8\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>online post</u></a>, she pointed out. That post said in part: &quot;This is just another boondoggle thought up by our current corrupt and mismanaged city council.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before that, Rife noted, Americans for Prosperity, a national group supportive of tea-party efforts, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/austin-tea-party/events/205345942/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>brought Cato Institute anti-rail activist Randal O&rsquo;Toole to Austin for September 2014 events</u></a> promoted by the Austin Tea Party. Also, Rife pointed out, the group has posted multiple messages opposing the proposal on its<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheAustinTexasTeaParty/timeline?ref=page_internal\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> Facebook page</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rife said the millionaire in the ad is Skaggs, the retired CEO and board chair of Tracor Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Skaggs,&quot; Rife asserted, &quot;has an extensive history of giving to Republican candidates and organizations in both state and federal elections.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Austin Tea Party</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign finance filings with the City of Austin don&rsquo;t show any Austin Tea Party expenditures in the run-up to balloting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Dean Wright, the group&rsquo;s organizer, told us the group hasn&rsquo;t spent money opposing Prop. 1. Otherwise, Wright said, it&rsquo;s referred what he estimated to be close to 3,000 individuals in its network to Citizens Against Rail Taxes, which he said has taken &quot;the leadership position.&quot; Wright said the Austin Tea Party supports CART&rsquo;s messaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We saw several anti-rail-proposition messages in the Austin Tea Party&rsquo;s Twitter posts including a message written Oct. 24, 2014 referring<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ATXTeaParty/status/525705958086168576\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> to Doggett as &quot;Kickback Lloyd&quot;</u></a> that was linked to its criticisms of Doggett&rsquo;s pro-proposition message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jim Skaggs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Skaggs confirmed he&rsquo;s a millionaire. He didn&rsquo;t commit to membership in any party. &quot;I frankly do not frequent the political world and do not really know the definition of &nbsp;&lsquo;conservative,&rsquo;&quot; Skaggs wrote. &quot;I am a common-sense person and dislike some of what all parties do. I was born a Central Texas Democrat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skaggs said Rife was incorrect about Americans for Prosperity bringing O&rsquo;Toole to Austin. We reached O&rsquo;Toole by phone who told us that out of interest in the rail vote, he decided to visit, going on to acquire his own plane ticket. O&rsquo;Toole, who said he stayed with Skaggs, said Americans for Prosperity sponsored one of his Austin events by reserving the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our search of campaign finance reports filed with the <a href=\"http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/php/cesearchSimple.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Texas Ethics Commission</u></a> showed <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGX1NfVkxNMkFEMVU/view?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Skaggs making about 100 donations</u></a> totaling over $100,000 to state-level Republican candidates or political groups from 2002 to September 2014; the biggest one was $10,000 given in 2008 to the political arm of the Texas Republican Advisory Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skaggs also has contributed to multiple Republican candidates or groups involved in federal races. In 2013, Skaggs gave donations of $2,600 to U.S. Reps. Michael McCaul and Roger Williams, both R-Austin, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=Skaggs%2C+James+B.&amp;cycle=2014\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to information drawn from federal campaign finance filings by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics</u></a>. In May 2014, the center indicates, Skaggs gave $300 to the Republican National Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over earlier years, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?&amp;name=Skaggs,%20James%20B.&amp;employ=&amp;cand=&amp;state=TX&amp;cycle=All&amp;soft=&amp;zip=78746&amp;sort=N&amp;page=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>another search</u></a> of the center&rsquo;s database indicates, Skaggs (who lives a few miles from the Texas Capitol in a part of Travis County not in Austin) gave money to Republicans including Cruz ($1,250); Texas U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (more than $4,000); President George W. Bush ($4,000); 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney ($4,000); Sen. John McCain, the party&rsquo;s 2008 nominee ($2,300); and presidential hopefuls Ron Paul ($1,000) and Herman Cain ($300).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1990s, Skaggs contributed to two Democrats, the center&#39;s database suggests, then-U.S. Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma ($500) and then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico ($250).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doggett said: &quot;The Austin Tea Party and an ultra-conservative millionaire are behind the&quot; campaign against the city&rsquo;s light-rail proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skaggs seems wealthy, has supported Republican candidates and is treasurer for the major group battling Prop. 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Austin Tea Party opposes the proposal too. However, the group hasn&rsquo;t spent a dime on the cause and doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a major mover in the anti-Prop. 1 campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We find this statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>HALF TRUE</em></strong><em> </em>&ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>UPDATED, 2:45 p.m., Oct. 31, 2014:</strong></em> This story was amended to specify that Americans for Prosperity didn&#39;t&nbsp; bring O&#39;Toole to Austin, contrary to what a pro-proposition activist said.
