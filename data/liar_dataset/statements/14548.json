The post presumably refers to House Minority Leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, but Keith Olbermann is a political commentator, not a congressman. Also, bills originating in the House of Representatives are identified as &quot;<a href=\"https://www.house.gov/content/learn/legislative_process/\">H.R.</a>&quot; not &quot;H.B.&quot; No such H.B. 2169-B bill has been introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A House bill bearing the numbers <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2169?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%222169+B%22%5D%7D&amp;r=2\">2169</a> was introduced in April 2017 by Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., but it has nothing to do with removing the U.S. citizenship requirement to become U.S. president. That bill introduced by a Republican lawmaker seeks to improve information sharing among local and federal entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake news post claims Pelosi issued a statement saying her bill would allow someone to run for president if they have lived in the United States for two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Asked if this would allow a foreign power to effectively take over the country or encourage terrorism, Pelosi explained that it would not because &lsquo;the embrace of the American people would be enough to ensure that the person does their very best,&rsquo; &quot; said Americannews88.com&rsquo;s post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website quotes &quot;Rep.Olbermann&quot; making the argument that if people from other countries come to the United States to run corporations, &quot;&lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t we do that with the government? We can&rsquo;t do worse than Trump&rsquo;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americannews88.com does not have any identifying information noting who&rsquo;s behind it, its purpose or mission. Its Sept. 18 post <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-house-dems-introduce-bill-to-remove-citizenship-requirement-from-presidency/\">also appears on TheLastLineofDefense.org</a>, a website that says everything on it &quot;is a satirical work of fiction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americannews88.com&rsquo;s post about House Democrats introducing a bill to remove the U.S. citizenship requirement to become U.S. president is fake news.
