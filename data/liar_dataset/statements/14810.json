Messitte ruled that that D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can serve subpoenas requiring Trump-owned companies to preserve documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Post</em> described the decision as &quot;a small advancement&quot; in the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We read Messitte&rsquo;s two-paragraph decision and saw nothing that addressed Trump himself being subpoenaed. Here is the main part:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is hereby ordered that the parties shall be permitted to serve subpoenas on third-parties for the sole purpose of preservation of documents,&quot; the judge wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked a spokeswoman for the Maryland attorney general if the ruling stated that the plaintiffs could subpoena Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, it only relates to preservation of documents,&quot; Raquel Coombs said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert Marus, a spokesman for the D.C. Attorney General, told PolitiFact that the ruling allows the plaintiffs to serve document preservation subpoenas on the <a href=\"https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/oag/page_content/attachments/Motion%20to%20Serve%20Doc%20Preserv%20Subp.pdf\">Trump-owned companies</a> in preparation for moving to the discovery phase of the lawsuit against President Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Those entities are not parties to this litigation, which means they would not normally be required to preserve documents. However, their records may be relevant to the case, which is why we asked the court for special permission to subpoena them to preserve these documents,&quot; Marus wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parties to litigation -- in this case Trump in his official capacity -- do not have to be subpoenaed to preserve documents, Marus said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department pointed to a court document filed on behalf of Trump in which the defendant argued that while a motion to dismiss is pending there shouldn&rsquo;t be any discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, a sitting president can be subpoenaed, said Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Richard Nixon had documents subpoenaed, and the Supreme Court upheld this,&quot; he told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline stated that a &quot;federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump.&quot; A federal judge made a ruling about the preservation of documents in a case, but the subpoenas pertain to third-parties, not Trump individually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-04T20:30:59.710513", "ruling_date": "2017-12-05T11:23:15", "ruling_headline": "No, judge didn't grant subpoena of President Donald Trump", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-judge-grant-subpoena-president-donald-trump", "ruling_link_text": "Read the court order", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>News.groopspeak.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://news.groopspeak.com/breaking-federal-judge-grants-permission-to-subpoena-trump/\">BREAKING: Federal Judge Grants Permission To Subpoena Trump,&quot; </a>Nov. 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/groopspeak/about/?ref=page_internal\"> Groopspeak</a>, Accessed Dec. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/maryland-dc-get-subpoena-power-in-trump-emoluments-suit/2017/11/29/983be4a6-d528-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html?tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.af20ed37012f\">&quot;Maryland, D.C. get subpoena power in Trump emoluments suit,&quot;</a> Nov. 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg,<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-29/trump-businesses-to-get-retention-subpoenas-in-emoluments-case\"> &quot;Trump Firms Must Save Records for AGs&#39; Emoluments Lawsuit,&quot;</a> Nov. 29, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maryland Attorney General, <a href=\"http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/Emoluments/default.aspx\">Emoluments lawsuit</a>, Accessed Dec. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. District Court, The District of Columbia and the State of Maryland vs Donald J.
