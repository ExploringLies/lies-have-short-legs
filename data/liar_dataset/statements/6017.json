Scott Walker&rsquo;s time as Milwaukee County executive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker has created a criminal defense fund to pay attorneys but has maintained he is not a target of the secret probe, which is being conducted by the Milwaukee County district attorney&rsquo;s office. The probe has led to <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/walkers-office-stonewalled-da-inquiry-record-shows-t65kbql-156065645.html\">criminal charges</a> against three former Walker aides, an appointee and a major campaign contributor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s challenger in the June 5, 2012 election, Democrat and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, alluded to the charges when he <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/wisconsin-politics/12-News-Gubernatorial-Debate-Part-4/-/10057500/14420734/-/13b56u1/-/index.html\">said</a>: &quot;I have a police department that arrests felons. He (Walker) has a practice of hiring them.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, felony charges are among those pending, but none involving Walker aides or the appointee has yet resulted in a felony conviction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few minutes later Barrett fired again:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I just want to say I&rsquo;ve been in public life for 28 years,&quot; said Barrett, who served in the state Legislature and Congress before becoming Milwaukee mayor in 2004, &quot;and no one on my staff has ever been charged with a crime, and I&rsquo;ve never had a criminal defense fund.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA quick Google search, however, found a <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> news <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/94780914.html\">article</a> reporting that Joseph N. Cantu, a receptionist in Barrett&rsquo;s mayoral office, was charged in May 2010 with suffocating his ex-girlfriend.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;These are shocking and serious charges,&quot; Patrick Curley, Barrett&#39;s chief of staff, said at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCourt <a href=\"http://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetails.do;jsessionid=8CA314F9C90796C3A3D743F8B473A5F6.render6?countyNo=40&amp;caseNo=2010CF002605&amp;cacheId=3FADB2B6F6B5B605B6E45C699EFFF526&amp;recordCount=10&amp;offset=6&amp;mode=charges\">records</a> show Cantu was charged with two felonies and a misdemeanor, but pleaded guilty to three misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and two counts of battery.
