One&nbsp;story we found online <a href=\"http://president45donaldtrump.com/treason-house-democrats-strike-implement-sharia-law/\">said the resolution</a> &quot;threatens to restrict our right to even report facts that tarnish Islam&rsquo;s reputation, a law that all Sharia-governed countries already have in place.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation. PolitiFact has checked <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/may/08/blog-posting/florida-democrats-just-voted-impose-sharia-law-wom/\">a string</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/jun/20/herman-cain/cain-claims-muslims-tried-influence-sharia-law-nj-/\">of complaints</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/may/14/leo-berman/state-rep-leo-berman-says-judges-dearborn-michigan/\">about efforts</a> to institute Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States &mdash; most recently by <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2016/nov/22/donald-trumps-security-adviser-pick-michael-flynn-/\">retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn</a>, the potential future national security adviser of President-elect Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the resolution, introduced by U.S. Rep. Donald Beyer of Virginia, did not seek to institute Sharia law, or any law, for that matter. The resolution was non-binding, meaning it did not have the effect of law, and was introduced to address an upswing in anti-Muslim sentiment. HR 569 has 145 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some online stories distorted what the bill would do by saying it &quot;will serve as a test by which further criminalizing of &lsquo;Islamophobia&rsquo; may be introduced&quot; and <a href=\"https://definingthenarrative.com/2016/01/07/update-hr-569-special-status-for-muslims-bill/\">single out only Muslims</a> as worthy of special protection. Some websites said the resolution would <a href=\"http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/261268/house-democrats-move-criminalize-criticism-islam-robert-spencer\">equate hate speech with violence</a>, and that would <a href=\"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7379/free-speech-islamic-law\">potentially alter constitutional rights</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But HR 569 &quot;declares that the civil rights and civil liberties of all United States citizens, including Muslims in the United States, should be protected and preserved.&quot; The resolution denounces &quot;the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim.&quot; It also &quot;steadfastly confirms its dedication to the rights and dignity of all its citizens of all faiths, beliefs, and cultures.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no threat of new legal reprisal for intolerance against Muslims, only that Congress would officially disapprove of such behavior. The aim was for Congress to show support for &quot;the inalienable right of every citizen to live without fear and intimidation, and to practice their freedom of faith.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resolution was referred to committee. With no Republican co-sponsors in the GOP-controlled House, it likely will not see any further action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers said, &quot;House Democrats strike to implement Sharia law!!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no kind of strike. Instead, the stories referred to a non-binding resolution introduced in December 2015 that sought to affirm congressional support for Muslim-Americans facing hate crimes and persecution. It did not have the effect of law or mention Sharia law, but rather aimed to send a message that anti-Muslim sentiment would not be tolerated by members of the U.S. House. The resolution has not received any Republican support and is likely dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wanting Congress to officially condemn hate speech and persecution is not the same as seeking to institute Sharia law. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4be7d5a5-d835-4f8b-b549-df5ec3b76690\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4be7d5a5-d835-4f8b-b549-df5ec3b76690</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-14T13:35:53.267113", "ruling_date": "2016-12-14T14:58:22", "ruling_headline": "Bloggers revive false claim that House Democrats strike to impose Sharia law", "ruling_headline_slug": "websites-revive-claim-house-democrats-strike-impos", "ruling_link_text": "A condemnation, not legislation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary For Prison, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Hillary4prisoner/posts/569087023294044\">Facebook post</a>, Dec. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MadWorldNews.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://madworldnews.com/house-dems-sharia-law/\">House Dems Moved To Implement First Sharia Law While You Weren&rsquo;t Looking</a>,&quot; Dec. 30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2016/nov/22/donald-trumps-security-adviser-pick-michael-flynn-/\">Trump security adviser pick Michael Flynn repeated wildly wrong claim about FL Democrats, Sharia law</a>,&quot; Nov. 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President45DonaldTrump.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://president45donaldtrump.com/treason-house-democrats-strike-implement-sharia-law/\">THIS IS TREASON!!
