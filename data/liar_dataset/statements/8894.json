As the city struggled to fix its budget problems, he won union concessions to reduce pension costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But critics question how far the pension deal negotiated by Taveras, now a candidate for governor, went to fix the problem. The most recent figures released last month show the plan is only 31.4-percent &nbsp;funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican mayoral candidate Daniel Harrop raised the issue during the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of WPRI&#39;s &quot;Newsmakers&quot; program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked why he wants to run again, he said the city needs a mayor who will stay around to solve the city&#39;s long-term problems and not have aspirations for higher office, like Taveras and his predecessor, David Cicilline, now a member of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion,&quot; Harrop said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would mean that the city, at the time, had a pension system that was only 20 percent funded. (The U.S. Government Accountability Office says public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we need to explain why we&#39;re ruling on a seemingly-straightforward statement two months after it was made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We began work on this item in December but getting up-to-date numbers about the city&#39;s pension fund turned out to be maddeningly difficult. The city was often slow to respond and listed different amounts in different reports over different time frames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to wait for the completion of the latest estimate of the city&#39;s accrued liability, in part because the city has refused to release an earlier actuary report for the year ending June 30, 2012, citing a dispute over its accuracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, a week ago, the city released the latest actuarial report, for the year ending June 30, 2013, allowing us to proceed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to December, when Harrop made his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point, we asked Harrop about his figures. He cited two blog postings on the Providence pension system from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, published Oct. 30, &nbsp;reported that the fund had <a href=\"http://blogs.wpri.com/2013/10/30/taveras-moves-11m-of-city-pension-assets-out-of-hedge-funds/#more-87817\"><u>$283 million in assets</u></a> on Oct. 22. The other, published Dec. 7, said the fund had a liability of &nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.wpri.com/2013/12/07/the-saturday-morning-post-quick-hits-on-politics-more-in-ri-94/\"><u>&quot;almost $1.2 billion.&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harrop also cited <a href=\"http://www.gcpvd.org/images/reports/2011-02-providence-report-of-the-municipal-finances-reveiw-panel.pdf\"><u>a 2011 city repor</u></a>t saying the liability as of June 30, 2010, was $1.256 billion, with assets of $316 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&#39;t know the precise status of the pension system the day Harrop made his statement. But now that we have the up-to-date financial reports, we do have a snapshot of what the system&#39;s assets and liabilities were as of June 30, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to that <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/205184917/Providence-Pension-Value-Report-for-year-ending-30June2013\"><u>latest actuary report</u></a>, released Jan. 31, 2014, on June 30 the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations. On that point, Harrop turns out to have been right on the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, according to both the actuary report and the city&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.providenceri.com/efile/5229\"><u>latest annual financial report</u></a>, released about a month after Harrop made his statement, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets, a lot more than what Harrop stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount in the city&#39;s investment account was <a href=\"https://data.providenceri.gov/api/file_data/SZsEaRwZT__5TC3yTAw9fS5MNHfcyJAhcG6t_Qw5ZdM?filename=6-30-13%2520City%2520of%2520Providence%2520Employees%27%2520Retirement%2520System%2520-%2520Current%2520Investment%2520Position%2520and%2520Performance%2520Estimate.pdf\"><u>$247 million</u></a>. In addition, there was $3 million in cash and $59 million the city paid into the fund that year. Finally, the report counted as an asset $26 million owed to the fund from loans made to people in the retirement system at a rate of 9.25 percent, according to David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Taveras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add all those together and you get the $336 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Harrop&rsquo;s defense, at the time he made his statement, up-to-date data on the city&rsquo;s pension obligations were not available. The city was withholding it as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, who the city accused of making &quot;fundamental and inexcusable errors&quot; in its 2012 pension calculations. This year Providence used a different firm, Segal Consulting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December, Daniel Harrop said, &quot;We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harrop was citing numbers from different sources and different years, and those numbers are moving targets. They all support his underlying point: Providence&#39;s pension program is woefully underfunded, even with recent concessions negotiated with the city&#39;s unions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the latest report of the city&#39;s actuary, which was not available at the time Harrop made his statement, the candidate was correct on his $1.2 billion figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, there was significantly more than a quarter billion dollars set aside in the city&#39;s coffers for pension costs. But the number he cited accurately reflected the approximate amount the city had in its investment portfolio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
