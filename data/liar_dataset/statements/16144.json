David McKinley, R-W.Va., took aim at the poverty rate in a Sept. 19 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/teamkendrawv/posts/760616137603680?__tn__=-R\">Facebook post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average,&quot; Fershee wrote in the post. &quot;The poor are getting (much) poorer and if you look at what my opponent is posting (stories about how great the economy is, using national statistics) he doesn&rsquo;t even seem to know that there&rsquo;s a problem in WV.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added, &quot;Are you ok with our state diving deeper into despair while our elected officials: vote for policy that drives wages lower, push to strip healthcare from poor people and people with pre-existing conditions, and then pat themselves on the back for a job well done? I&rsquo;m not. This is unacceptable. But WE can fix it on Nov. 6.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether poverty in West Virginia is more than 5 percent higher than the national average. So we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post links to a Sept. 18 <a href=\"http://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2018/09/poverty-increases-in-w-va/?fbclid=IwAR2WyxJk6GYz0u2VdH2frEFKM0U8GVD4HEBfcwx9h9WfYGdS2sYkqmR_vY4\">article</a> in the Parkersburg News and Sentinel headlined, &quot;Poverty increases in W.Va.&quot; According to the article, &quot;About 336,000 West Virginians lived in poverty in 2017, 5.7 percent higher than the national average. West Virginia was among the top four states with poverty rates of 18 percent &ndash; Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and West Virginia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To confirm the newspaper&rsquo;s data, we turned to the <a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">original figures</a> from the U.S. Census Bureau. The numbers check out: The U.S poverty rate was 13.4 percent, but the West Virginia poverty rate was 19.1. The difference: 5.7 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be precise, however, Fershee should have said that the poverty rate in West Virginia is more than 5 percentage points higher than the United States as a whole -- not 5 percent higher. If it were 5 percent higher, the poverty rate in West Virginia would be about 14.1 percent, not 19.1 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the poverty rate in West Virginia is actually higher than Fershee&rsquo;s literal words suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview, Fershee said that it&rsquo;s important to note that &quot;the rest of the country is doing better, and West Virginia&rsquo;s poverty rate has actually worsened,&quot; said Fershee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The historical data bears that out. Here&rsquo;s a chart of the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates going back to 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, the gap between the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates was 1.9 percentage points. Five years later, the gap was 5.7 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Fershee said, &quot;Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a slip-up in her mathematical terminology keeps this from being fully accurate. The poverty rate in West Virginia was 5.7 percentage points higher than the national rate, not more than 5 percent higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-01T10:38:02.274539", "ruling_date": "2018-11-01T13:12:09", "ruling_headline": "Is West Virginia poverty 5% higher than U.S. as a whole?", "ruling_headline_slug": "west-virginia-poverty-5-higher-us-whole", "ruling_link_text": "5 percentage points, not percent", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Kendra Fershee, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/teamkendrawv/posts/760616137603680?__xts__[0]=68.ARBAO786b5ZmMdYroGLxAQLJ-v9GI20eFpKBYkvXawb65J085Q3ypI0smuslwIpWeAkH4oCAWXFKySf752anvIG9WmeMgBDI7-KtEbvJv11Ly-DMGrHyZ5KXRrf6EAMtoeY5qiXxneBdkb5DB9jCUKlgagkYAc4sbvm_L2uITOZHYPEcu_jk&amp;__tn__=-R\">Facebook post</a>, Sept. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parkersburg News and Sentinel, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2018/09/poverty-increases-in-w-va/\">Poverty increases in W.Va</a>.,&quot; Sept. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">state and national poverty data</a>, accessed Oct. 31, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Eric Bowen, research professor in West Virginia University&rsquo;s Bureau of Business and Economic Research, Oct. 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kendra Fershee, Democratic congressional candidate, Oct. 19, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. House candidate", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Kendra", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "West Virginia", "id": 4478, "last_name": "Fershee", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "kendra-fershee", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Screen_Shot_2018-11-01_at_10.40.21_AM.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "West Virginia", "edition": "West Virginia", "edition_slug": "west-virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 64, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The West Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/64/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4478/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.teamkendrawv.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Facebook post", "statement_date": "2018-09-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 29, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/29/", "subject": "Poverty", "subject_slug": "poverty", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. House of Representatives", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "West Virginia", "id": 4451, "last_name": "McKinley", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "david-mckinley", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/McKinley_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "West Virginia", "edition": "West Virginia", "edition_slug": "west-virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 64, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The West Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/64/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4451/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "https://mckinley.house.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": "Is West Virginia poverty 5% higher than U.S. as a whole?"}
