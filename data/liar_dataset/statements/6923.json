That will change soon with the addition of the Milwaukie light rail bridge, scheduled to be up and running by fall 2015.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce the deck starts going up and the cables are attached, it&rsquo;ll be one of the most visible public works projects for the city in some time. It&rsquo;s little wonder, then, that Portland City Council candidate Mary Nolan is touting on her website her role in making it happen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;re building the first new bridge across the Willamette in more than 40 years, this one dedicated to transit, pedestrian and bike traffic,&quot; she writes on her website. &quot;As Co-Chair of the Joint Ways &amp; Means Committee, I secured the key piece of funding for this important project.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe see a lot of claims like these -- where folks who sat on a committee claim some crucial role. Sometimes it&rsquo;s real, sometimes it&rsquo;s a stretch. We wondered what the situation was here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called TriMet to figure out what the deal was with the Legislature&rsquo;s funding contribution for the project. Spokeswoman Mary Fetsch pointed us to House Bill 5036 from 2007, which authorized $250 million worth of lottery bonds for the project. The funding at the state level was itself instrumental in securing matching federal dollars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack in 2007, Nolan was, indeed, a co-chair of the budget writing committee, along with now-Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It&rsquo;s fair to say that, as co-chairs of the committee, they had final say on how the dollars were spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered, though, just how big a role Nolan played in this particular get for the city of Portland. We spoke with TriMet lobbyist Olivia Clark. She described the process as a group effort. She ticked off several names -- Rep. Carolyn Tomei, Rep. Dave Hunt, now-U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, now-Secretary of State Kate Brown and Schrader -- as essential in getting the funding secured.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Nolan, she called the candidate&rsquo;s involvement &quot;vital.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;She was definitely a leader in the effort,&quot; Clark said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Clark&rsquo;s advice, we also spoke with Schrader, who confirmed Nolan&rsquo;s role in the effort as essential saying that &quot;Mary was big on this piece.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we spoke with Nolan, she talked about how she had held firm on getting the full amount in 2007 -- even after the governor&rsquo;s office had pushed to hold off until 2009 or to split the sum between two bienniums. &quot;I said &lsquo;No&rsquo; and Schrader backed me up,&quot; Nolan said. &quot;It was critical for the metropolitan region.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClark, the lobbyist, recalled a similar negotiation when we spoke with her earlier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNolan said she &quot;secured the key piece of funding&quot; for the &nbsp;Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge. It might be nice if that read &quot;helped secure&quot; instead -- it was certainly a group effort. But based on committee assignments and interviews with two people closest to the negotiations, it does appear that Nolan played a key role.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-15T16:26:28.403677", "ruling_date": "2012-10-15T13:25:38", "ruling_headline": "Did Mary Nolan secure funding for Milwaukie bridge project?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-mary-nolan-really-secure-funding-new-bridge-pr", "ruling_link_text": "It was a group effort but she was 'vital.'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail from Mary Fetsch, spokeswoman for TriMet, Oct. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Olivia Clark, lobbyist for TriMet, Oct. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with U.S. Rep.
