Because Cantor was Jewish, the lone voice for religious diversity in the GOP&rsquo;s congressional ranks will also disappear, argued Bill Maher, host of HBO&rsquo;s <em>Real Time</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now there are no non-Christian Republicans. This is an amazing fact,&quot; Maher said June 13. &quot;There are 278 Republicans in Congress. They are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed. So this is an entirely Christian, white party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does Cantor&rsquo;s primary defeat mean Republicans in Congress are now all white and all Christian?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Republicans &lsquo;all Christian&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2012 elections ushered in the first Buddhist in the Senate (Hawaii&rsquo;s Mazie Hirono, a Democrat), the first Hindu in either chamber (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat), and the first Congress member to list her religious affiliation as &quot;none&quot; (Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat), according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which recorded the <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/11/113-congress-relig-affil.pdf\"><u>religious affiliation</u></a> of members <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2012/11/16/faith-on-the-hill-the-religious-composition-of-the-113th-congress/#party\"><u>for a 2012 report.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They joined two Muslims (Democrats) and a Unitarian Universalist (a Democrat).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to Republicans,<strong> </strong>192 of 278 GOP members identify with a Protestant denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.), 70 identify as Catholic, three are Orthodox Christian, and 12 are Mormon (more on that in a moment). Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, is Jewish and makes No. 278, but Brat, the Republican who could succeed him after the November election, is Catholic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only possible hang-up to Maher&rsquo;s claim when examining the current makeup of Congress when it comes to religion is how you view Mormonism.<strong> </strong>Some Christians <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16315111\"><u>do not recognize</u></a> Mormons, belonging to the <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng\"><u>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</u></a>, as Christians. <u><a href=\"http://www.mormon.org/faq/topic/jesus-christ/question/purpose-of-the-savior\">Mormons</a></u>&nbsp;do consider themselves Christians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Republicans &lsquo;all white&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maher also said the GOP&rsquo;s congressional ranks are all-white except for one appointed African-American official. That&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/12/19/tim-scott-treads-carefully-through-south-carolina-and-d-c-political-thicket/\"><u>Sen. Tim Scott</u></a>, R-S.C., who resigned his House seat for a Senate appointment in January 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To say the other Republicans in Congress are all white depends on your definition of &quot;all white,&quot; which isn&rsquo;t always so easy to define.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no other African-American Republicans in Congress (there are 43 black Democrats). &nbsp;There also are no Asian or Pacific Islander Republicans in Congress (there are 13 Democrats).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, according to the <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42964.pdf\"><u>Congressional Research Service</u></a>. That includes Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Florida Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, born in Puerto Rico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau, however, does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html\"><u>categories</u></a> white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian. The Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnicity, which is based on cultural or linguistic&nbsp;similarity. Hispanics could identify with any race depending on the region from where they descend, or list none at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew says as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents selected &nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/14/u-s-census-looking-at-big-changes-in-how-it-asks-about-race-and-ethnicity/\"><u>some other race</u></a>&quot; in the 2010 census, the vast majority of whom were Hispanic. And there is a movement to include Hispanic as a racial category in future censuses, says Kevin Dougherty, Baylor University sociology professor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To say they are all white, you think they have very fair skin and have European descent,&quot; Dougherty said. &quot;It does mask an important source of diversity that is present among Republicans in Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just Hispanics who are unaccounted for in Maher&rsquo;s claim. We know of two Republicans that are enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian tribes. The first is Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., <a href=\"http://cole.house.gov/our-district/native-american-heritage\"><u>who is a member of the</u><u> Chickasaw Nation</u></a> tribe. The second is freshman Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., <a href=\"http://mullin.house.gov/about/full-biography\"><u>a citizen of the Cherokee Nation</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The timeline of all this</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more critical point: When Maher says the Republicans in Congress are &quot;now&quot; all white and all Christian, that&rsquo;s not accurate -- Cantor isn&rsquo;t going anywhere yet. The GOP&rsquo;s lone Jewish member will not leave until his replacement is sworn into office in early 2015, after the midterm elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as he leaves office, it&rsquo;s possible that new non-white, non-Christian Republicans could take seats in Congress.

Still, Maher&rsquo;s unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOP&rsquo;s ranks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On religion, Maher&#39;s claim comes down to how you view Mormonism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white,&nbsp;Hispanic or something else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Cantor isn&rsquo;t leaving office until the end of his term in January. It&rsquo;s possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maher&rsquo;s statement is partially accurare&nbsp;but leaves out important details.
