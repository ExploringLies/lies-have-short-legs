Ron Amstutz, a Republican from Wooster, recently defended Gov. John Kasich&rsquo;s two-year budget blueprint, which the Republican-controlled House and Senate have left largely in tact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a letter published May 28 in The Columbus Dispatch, Amstutz said that budget &quot;invests in Ohio&rsquo;s future and a stable fiscal path toward a stronger Ohio.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChairman of the powerful House finance committee, Amstutz was responding to criticism of the $55.6 billion budget that House Minority Leader Armond Budish made in his own letter to The Dispatch. Among Budish&rsquo;s contentions was that Kasich&#39;s budget proposal amounts to Ohio&#39;s second largest spending increase, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/jun/09/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-kasichs-budget-plan-c/\">a claim PolitiFact Ohio rated as Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmstutz said Budish&rsquo;s charge that the budget increases state spending &quot;left absent a major component to his commentary: reality.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the points Amstutz raised to defend the GOP budget: &quot;The current budget (now being debated) significantly decreases the use of one-time resources, using $1.2 billion this year and around $100 million the following year.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmstutz said that Budish and Democrats failed to wean the state from one-time money and that the Republican&rsquo;s use of one-time money for the Kasich budget &quot;pales in comparison.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tGiven how often politicians use the term &quot;one-time money&quot; as a weapon, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Amstutz claims.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWhen politicians refer to one-time money &ndash; they are referring to money that won&rsquo;t be available in the next budget cycle. The sources of the one-time money include federal stimulus money and savings from debt restructuring.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio relied on unprecedented levels of one-time money to balance the two-year budget, passed in July 2009, when Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and Democratic House were in charge. It will expire at the end of June 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpecifically, that budget contained around $4.89 billion in one-time money. That figure grew to more than $6 billion as a delay of an income tax cut, higher reimbursement rates for prescription drugs under Medicaid, and other money was added. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans have argued the figure is even higher &ndash; more than &nbsp;$8 billion. The differences between the figures are the result of disagreements over what qualifies as one-time money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans, especially then-gubernatorial candidate John Kasich, exploited the state&rsquo;s use of one-time money as reckless and said it leaves them to fill a massive budget hole.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven the Republican&rsquo;s rhetoric, it might surprise some that they, too, are relying on such found money to balance the next two-year budget. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis brings us back to Amstutz, who says the state will use about $1.2 billion this year and use $100 million in the following year. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s budget &ndash; tweaked since by the legislature -- includes the following sources of one-time money during the first year of the two-year cycle: &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$500 million from leasing Ohio liquor sales to Kasich&rsquo;s JobsOhio program</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$440 million in savings from restructuring state debt at a lower interest rate</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$115 million of unclaimed state money &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$75 million from the sale of state prisons</li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$30 million from a tax amnesty program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese total $1.16 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe only one-time money being used in the second-year of the budget is a transfer of $100 million in unclaimed state funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, where does this leave Amstutz claims?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, he says the state is relying on $1.2 billion in one-time money in the first year of the proposed budget, which is pretty darn close to $1.16 billion. And, as he says, the budget eliminates in the second year all one-time money except $100 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThough debate still exists over the exact figure of one-time money used in the last budget cycle, the level of one-time money used was unprecedented and is clearly far greater than what is proposed in the new budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmstutz&rsquo; statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significantly missing for a full understanding. On the Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact Ohio rates Amstutz&rsquo; statement as True.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-13T18:45:47.363679", "ruling_date": "2011-06-14T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Rep.
