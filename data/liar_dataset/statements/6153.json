It earned a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-median-income-has-declined-10-/\">Half True</a> from PolitiFact National, which said the numbers were outdated by six months, somewhat off the mark and from a respected but unproven data-analysis firm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered what the numbers look like now, with another 10 months in the books.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this case, we&rsquo;ll look only at the income trend, not to what degree Obama is to blame for any decline. In Janesville, Romney surely was out to criticize Obama, but his remarks show it was more for being out of touch than saying he was responsible for creating the problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe gold standard of income data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. But it is generated only once a year, so it is not very timely. The 2011 data is not out yet. More on that later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn both instances, Romney turned to household income figures generated by a private economic research agency, Maryland-based <a href=\"http://sentierresearch.com/\">Sentier Research</a>. The firm uses other Census Bureau income data that is released monthly and adjusts it to provide a more timely look at income trends. Its reports have become widely quoted in <a href=\"http://sentierresearch.com/news.html\">media accounts</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn January, and again in Janesville, Romney said he was comparing changes in the &quot;last four years,&quot; which takes us to different periods in the George W. Bush presidency as the starting point. We examined Sentier&rsquo;s reports from April 2008 to April 2012, the latest available from the firm at the time of Romney&rsquo;s speech.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe inflation-adjusted median household income declined 8.3 percent when comparing those two points in time, a decline of $4,596 per household.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo by the latest numbers in the report Romney used, he&rsquo;s in the ballpark but off more than a percentage point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCase closed? Not quite.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s campaign told us &nbsp;relied on a reference to earlier Sentier research that was highlighted in an April 30, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/print/2012-05-01/obama-fails-to-stem-middle-class-slide-he-blamed-on-bush.html\">Bloomberg news report</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat piece referred to February 2012 data from Sentier showing a 9.7 percent drop compared with the same month in 2008. The big swing in just a couple months is not unusual in the month-to-month data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, as in the presidential debate reference, Romney was very close using outdated data, but high compared to the latest data available when he spoke.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEither way, according to the Sentier data, the income trend has gone the wrong direction in the last four years. Median household incomes move up and down, but overall trended sharply downward during Obama&rsquo;s first two and a half years before recovering somewhat since summer 2011, according to <a href=\"http://www.sentierresearch.com/reports/Sentier_Household_Income_Trends_Report_April_2012_06_05_12.pdf\">the firm&rsquo;s index</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe more standard source of income statistics, the annual Census Bureau data, has figures only through 2010 because 2011 is not out yet. That survey asks people in the spring what they earned for the previous calendar year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing that annual data for a four-year comparison going back to 2007, incomes declined 6.4 percent from 2007 to 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause the reference periods are different, the trends identified by the annual census data can&rsquo;t really be compared directly to monthly census data that Sentier uses. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National has examined in detail the data source that Romney uses, Sentier Research. The firm is run by two retired Census Bureau officials (one of whom, Gordon Green, directed the income statistics program) whose work has been cited in <a href=\"http://sentierresearch.com/news.html\">many national news publications</a>. Sentier&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://sentierresearch.com/aboutus.html\">client list</a> has included major government clients and think tanks on both sides of the ideological spectrum.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEconomists have said the Sentier-created income index fills a knowledge gap in a timely way, but still has to stand the test of time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney chided Obama for being out of touch, saying that median household incomes have fallen 10 percent. He uses data from a reputable private firm that used census data to create a new income index.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt one point in Obama&rsquo;s term incomes were down about 10 percent from four years earlier, but the decline is now closer to 8 percent, based on the firm&rsquo;s data. Romney continues to use the outdated figure, making the decline sound somewhat larger than it is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll stick with the Half True rating he received in January, based on the Truth-O-Meter definition of a claim that is &quot;partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.&quot;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-24T17:45:37.151352", "ruling_date": "2012-06-27T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Romney says median income has dropped 10 percent in last four years", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-says-median-income-has-dropped-10-percent-l", "ruling_link_text": "Arguably true at one time, but no longer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin Eye, <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=6206\">video of Romney speech</a>, Janesville, WI, June 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Gordon Green, partner, Sentier Research, June 19-20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Allie Brandenburger, Romney campaign spokeswoman, June 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBloomberg News, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/print/2012-05-01/obama-fails-to-stem-middle-class-slide-he-blamed-on-bush.html\">&quot;Obama Fails to Stem Middle-Class Slide He Blamed on Bush</a>,&quot; April 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSentier Research, <a href=\"http://www.sentierresearch.com/reports/Sentier_Research_Household_Income_Trends_Report_February_2012_12_03_29.pdf\">Household Income Trend</a>s February 2012, March 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-median-income-has-declined-10-/\">Truth-O-Meter item</a>, Romney statement on income, Jan. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUS Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Income+table.xls\">Household Income Table, 1967-2010</a>, accessed June 20, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;The median income in America has dropped by 10 percent in the last four years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2012-06-18", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
