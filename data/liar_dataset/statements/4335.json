Scott Walker signed the 2011-13 state budget in June. But that didn&rsquo;t stop the spending plan from playing a prominent role in the state Senate recall campaigns in August.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans worked to paint their Democratic opponents -- the members of the Assembly running against GOP senators and Democratic senators defending their seats -- as reckless spenders who left a mess to be cleaned up. The refrain was that the Democratic lawmakers, along with former Gov. Jim Doyle, are to blame for the state being bankrupt or broke.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere were many variations of it, but one seemed worth visiting even though the recall elections are over. Why? Some claims have a way of being recycled for future campaigns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe one we are looking at came in a radio ad by Republican Jonathan Steitz, who lost his bid to unseat Sen. Robert Wirch (D-Pleasant Prairie) in the Aug. 16, 2011 recall election<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Wirch voted to raise job-killing taxes by $4.7 billion, and voted for $3.6 billion in out-of-control reckless government spending ... &nbsp;and after all those taxes and all that spending ... &nbsp;Wirch left us with three billion in debt... only to flee to Illinois instead of staying to get the job done.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCall it the $3.6 billion question. Or, in this case, $3.6 billion accusation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe previously <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/25/mark-pocan/wisconsin-state-rep-mark-pocan-says-gov-scott-walk/\">rated</a> False a statement by state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) that Walker&rsquo;s estimate of the budget deficit was a &quot;bogus figure.&quot; We also <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/29/jim-doyle/gov-jim-doyle-says-wisconsins-projected-budget-sho/\">found</a> Doyle&rsquo;s late 2010 estimate of the size of the deficit was False, in part because it included many assumptions about what Walker might do. And we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/03/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-broke/\">found</a> Walker&rsquo;s statement that the state was &quot;broke&quot; to be False. (We&rsquo;ve also ruled on several statements about the &quot;structural deficit&quot; -- an entirely &nbsp;different matter.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSee what we mean about themes coming up again and again?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, back to the claim: Did Democrats under Doyle approve a budget that left the state in debt?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot a deficit. Debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe short answer is no. That&rsquo;s not how the budget process works, said Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The state constitution requires lawmakers approve a budget that&rsquo;s balanced, and the budget that was passed for 2009-11 was no exception.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $3.6 billion figure came about when the state budget office looked at the 2009-2011 budget, as plans were being readied for the next one (the 2011-13 budget). The report considers tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget, and came up with what Lang termed a &quot;shortfall.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, the calculation depended on which party is running the budget office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn November 2010, the outgoing Doyle administration said the shortfall was $1.5 billion, which was far lower than the $2.7 billion figure used by candidates during the campaign for governor. In February 2011, Walker&rsquo;s Department of Administration ran its own version of the numbers and concluded that the shortfall was $3.6 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what does that number represent?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s a challenge,&quot; Lang said of the figure. &quot;The challenge for the 2011-13 budget was $3.6 billion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, that was the amount -- through a combination of spending cuts, tax increases or other measures -- that the state budget would have to be adjusted to account for all of the department budget requests and the projected tax revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne thing is clear: The $3.6 billion was not a debt, as Steitz claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDebt is something that is owed, typically over the long term. Borrowed money, for instance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state did not borrow, bond or otherwise owe money to anyone because of the $3.6 billion. Other steps -- some very controversial politically -- were taken to address the gap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLang put it this way: &quot;We did not have a deficit, nor were we in debt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLang noted that the shorthand for the shortfall, including in Journal Sentinel news accounts, was a &quot;deficit&quot; -- but rarely, if ever, a debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings us to the bottom line:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteitz claimed that the 2009-2011 budget approved by Democrats created a $3.6 billion debt for Walker and the new Republican Legislature. Under the state constitution, the state budget has to be balanced. While some phrased the shortfall for the next two-year budget as a deficit, it certainly was not a debt. That comes with borrowed money that must be repaid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-23T15:26:51.032921", "ruling_date": "2011-08-24T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Republican candidate Jonathan Steitz says Democrats approved a budget that left the state $3 billion in debt", "ruling_headline_slug": "republican-candidate-jonathan-steitz-says-democrat", "ruling_link_text": "A shortfall is a challenge; a debt is a debt", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=243535\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.26180904220989887\">Radio </a><a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=243535\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.26180904220989887\">ad </a>for Republican state senate candidate Jonathan Steitz<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/12/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-/\">&quot;U.S. Rep.
