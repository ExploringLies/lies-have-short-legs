Several Republicans pointed  to that episode in their initial comments on Kagan, calling the incident  troubling. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., also pointed out that the  incident put her on the losing side of a Supreme Court ruling.<br /><br />At  Harvard Law School, Barrasso said, \"She took a position and the Supreme  Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong.\" Barrasso said he was  keeping an open mind on the nomination. <br /><br />We were interested in  fact-checking his statement that the Supreme Court \"ruled unanimously  that she was wrong.\" <br /><br />The controversy over military recruiters  began even before Kagan became dean of Harvard Law in 2003. Harvard was  one of several top-tier law schools that attempted to ban military  recruiters because of the policy that prevented gays and lesbians from  serving openly in the military. <br /><br />In 2003, Kagan penned a letter  to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue: <br /><br />\"I  abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance  of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that  members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this  discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives  many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity  to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound  wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that  tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members  cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their  country.\"<br /><br />Congress threatened to yank federal funding for schools  that banned recruiters through a measure known as the Solomon  Amendment, named for Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and first passed in  1996. Schools and recruiters tried to sort out their differences in the  intervening years, with some schools providing partial access. But  eventually the issue came before the Supreme Court in 2004 in a case  known as <em>Rumsfeld vs. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights</em>, known  as FAIR. FAIR was an association of law schools that opposed the Solomon  Amendment.<br /><br />In her role as a professor of law at Havard, Kagan  signed onto an amicus brief (sometimes known as a \"friend of the court\"  brief) filed by 40 Harvard professors that argued that the federal  government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied  the same policies to all recruiters. Harvard, for example, required all  recruiters to sign forms indicating they would not discriminate against  applicants based on sexual orientation. The withholding of funds  interfered with the schools' freedom of expression to oppose what they  felt were discriminatory policies.<br /><br />The Harvard law professors  argued in their brief that \"this case is not -- and has never been --  about whether law schools may 'discriminate' against the military or  whether they must provide 'equal access' to military recruiters.  Instead, the question is whether the Solomon Amendment confers upon  military recruiters the unprecedented entitlement to disregard neutral  and generally applicable recruiting rules whenever a school's failure to  make a special exception might incidentally hinger or preclude military  recruiting. The answer is 'no.'\"<br /><br />The Supreme Court, however,  disagreed in an 8-0 ruling on March 6, 2006. The majority opinion,  written by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled against FAIR and, in doing  so, rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the  school had the right to enforce non-discrimination policies against the  military. \"Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same  access as recruiters who comply with the policy,\" the opinion said.<br /><br />The  court also rejected arguments that claimed that the law  schools' treatment of military recruiters could be considered expression under the First Amendment. If the action  itself were purely expressive, the court reasoned, the schools would  not have to issue statements explaining their actions. The court  compared the situation to someone who says he won't pay his income taxes  because he disapproves of the Internal Revenue Service. The disapproval  is protected speech, but the non-payment of taxes is not.<br /><br />The  opinion was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia,  Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and  Stephen Breyer joining Roberts. Justice Samuel Alito did not  participate because he had not yet been seated to the court when oral  arguments were made. <br /><br />Barrasso said Kagan \"took a position and  the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong.\" The court did  reject the arguments put forward by the law schools, which included FAIR  and the brief filed by the Harvard professors. All of the justices who  voted opposed the law schools' arguments. So we rate Barrasso's  statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-10T18:00:55.983419", "ruling_date": "2010-05-10T18:24:15", "ruling_headline": "Supreme Court rejected arguments Kagan promoted", "ruling_headline_slug": "supreme-court-rejected-arguments-kagan-promoted", "ruling_link_text": "SCOTUS said no", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4186199/barasso-ready-to-question-kagan\" target=\"_blank\">Barrasso ready to question Kagan</a>, May 10, 2010</p>\r\n<p>FindLaw, <a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=04-1152\" target=\"_blank\">Rumsfeld v.
