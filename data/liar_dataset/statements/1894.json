Blanche Lincoln's narrow victory in the Arkansas Democratic primary was  a big topic on ABC's <em>This Week</em> on Sunday, June 13, 2010. Organized  labor poured $10 million into the campaign of her opponent, Lt. Gov.  Bill Halter, while Bill Clinton, who served as Arkansas governor before  becoming president, came out in strong support for Lincoln.<br /> <br /> <em>This Week</em> host Jake Tapper began the conversation by showing a clip of  White House spokesman Robert Gibbs criticizing the unions for not using  that money to help in the general election. Tapper asked Democratic  strategist Donna Brazile, \"Is the White House risking alienating labor  with that kind of talk?\" <br /> <br /> Brazile responded that the White House should be careful about  alienating labor because unions provide key grass-roots support.<br /> <br /> Brazile said that \"Blanche Lincoln ran a great campaign. She ran against  Washington. Labor, the money did make her the outsider. She was able to  reconnect with her base, and she pulled her base out. She still has  trouble in the general election, but she ran a very smart, strategic  campaign.\"<br /> <br /> Brazile added, \"And Bill Clinton helped her. He is popular. Ninety  percent of the people in the state still love him. And he was able to  pull out the stops to get her elected.\"<br /> <br /> We were curious about the claim that 90 percent of the people in  Arkansas still love Bill Clinton. That number seemed high, so we  e-mailed Brazile to ask her source. She replied that she was referring  to the \"base of the Democratic party\" and not ALL people. It was a  Democratic run-off and I did not set it up right (in the comment on the  show) because we had so many races to cover.\"<br /> <br /> Brazile said she was sorry about not providing the context and that she  thought it was clear she was talking about Democratic primary voters. <br /> <br /> But we watched the clip and thought many people might think she meant  Clinton was popular with 90 percent of all people in Arkansas.<br />  His nationwide numbers are significantly lower. In a CNN/Opinion  Research Corporation poll dated from October 2009, 64 percent of those  polled said that they had a favorable opinion of Clinton. We would  expect him to be more popular in his home state, but we doubt his  popularity would be 26 points higher. Brazile acknowledged that would be  highly unlikely \"in this highly charged partisan environment.\"<br /> <br /> But for Democratic primary voters, Brazile is on solid ground. She sent  us a poll from Lake Research Partners of likely Democratic primary  voters in Arkansas that found 86 percent had a favorable approval rating  of Clinton.<br /> <br /> So Brazile was very close with her number, but she left out an important  detail -- that it applied only to Democratic primary voters. Still, it was made in the context of a discussion about the Democratic primary. So we find  her claim Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-14T17:34:09.437051", "ruling_date": "2010-06-15T10:16:14", "ruling_headline": "Brazile says Clinton loved by 90 percent of Arkansans", "ruling_headline_slug": "brazile-says-clinton-loved-90-percent-arkansans", "ruling_link_text": "Should have specified Democratic primary voters", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-hoyer-boehner-bill-gates/story?id=10900231\" target=\"_blank\">This  Week Transcript,</a> June 13, 2010</p>\r\n<p>E-mail interview with Donna Brazile, June 14, 2010.<br /><br />E-mail interview with Jake Tapper, June 14, 2010.<br /><br />PollingReport.com, <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/clinton1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\"Bill Clinton:  Favorability Ratings.\"</a></p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Political commentator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Donna", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 205, "last_name": "Brazile", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "donna-brazile", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/t1larg.brazile.55.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/205/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://donnabrazile.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Ninety percent of the people in Arkansas still love Bill Clinton.</p>", "statement_context": "a statement on ABC News' 'This Week.'", "statement_date": "2010-06-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 151, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/151/", "subject": "This Week - ABC News", "subject_slug": "abc-news-week", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
