Superimposed over a photograph of Sanders, it said, &quot;Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual&#39;s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the reader who sent us the image for the original source, and he sent us to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?_rdr=p&amp;fbid=613922428831&amp;id=146000320\">personal page</a> on Facebook. That page alone reported more than 9,000 shares and 1,000 likes for the Sanders image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did Sanders really say (or write) this? We took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quick Google search provided an answer. Those words were actually written by <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/ted-kaczynski-578450#national-threat\">Theodore Kaczynski</a>. Kaczynski was arrested in 1996 and accused of sending mail bombs to universities and airlines that resulted in three deaths and 23 injuries over two decades; he pled guilty and is now serving four life sentences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaczynski was captured after he sent a 35,000-word &quot;manifesto&quot; to the <em>Washington Post </em>and the <em>New York Times </em>in 1995, saying he would commit another bombing unless it was published in full. On the recommendation of the attorney general and the FBI director, the <em>Post </em>published it as a supplement to the newspaper. Its publication is credited with breaking the case, after Kaczynski&rsquo;s brother David recognized the writing style and arguments in the manifesto as his estranged brother&rsquo;s and informed the authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a portion of the manifesto, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm\">archived on the <em>Post</em>&rsquo;s site</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual&rsquo;s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wording is identical to what&rsquo;s in the graphic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To their credit, a number of commenters on the original Facebook page figured out that the quote was actually by Kaczynski.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet graphic says Sanders said, &quot;Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs.&quot; He didn&rsquo;t -- Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, wrote that in his 1995 manifesto.
