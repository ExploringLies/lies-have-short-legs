It&rsquo;s difficult to say where the item originated, but <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Bill+Gates%3A+%E2%80%9CI+think+Donald+Trump+will+go+down+to+history+as+one+of+the+greatest+presidents%2C+just+like+Reagan.%E2%80%9D&amp;oq=Bill+Gates%3A+%E2%80%9CI+think+Donald+Trump+will+go+down+to+history+as+one+of+the+greatest+presidents%2C+just+like+Reagan.%E2%80%9D&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.415j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">it&rsquo;s now widespread</a>, having been reposted as <a href=\"http://www.konkonsagh.biz/2017/02/bill-gates-i-think-donald-trump-will-go.html\">recently as Valentine&rsquo;s Day</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the dodgy grammar and spelling, the tweet itself likely came from a website allowing people to create fake tweets featuring real accounts. It&rsquo;s not all that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=create+a+fake+tweet\">difficult to find one</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also easy to see that Gates didn&rsquo;t send the tweet. While he has more than 33 million followers, Gates isn&rsquo;t nearly as prolific a thumb-masher as Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only tweet Gates appears to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/823325262985199616\">sent on Jan. 22</a> was to congratulate former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Jeff Raikes for <a href=\"http://news.stanford.edu/2017/01/18/jeff-raikes-elected-chair-stanford-university-board-trustees/\">being elected chairman</a> of the Stanford University Board of Trustees.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet Archive <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170123072911/https:/twitter.com/BillGates\">doesn&rsquo;t show that he tweeted anything else that day</a>, so it doesn&rsquo;t appear Gates mentioned Trump and then deleted it. He doesn&rsquo;t appear to have ever <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=Trump%20from%3ABillGates&amp;src=typd\">tweeted about Trump at all</a>, although he has been <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/281898-bill-gates-trump-hasnt-been-known-for-charitable-giving\">somewhat critical of Trump</a> in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gates did talk with Trump prior to his inauguration and did compare the real estate tycoon to a president &mdash; but it was John F. Kennedy, not Reagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A lot of his message has been about where he sees things not as good as he&#39;d like,&quot; Gates said <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/13/after-talking-with-trump-bill-gates-likens-president-elect-to-jfk.html\">on CNBC on Dec. 13, 2016</a>, about a phone call he had with Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But in the same way President Kennedy talked about the space mission and got the country behind that, I think that whether it&#39;s education or stopping epidemics, other health breakthroughs, finishing polio, and in this energy space, there can be a very upbeat message that (Trump&#39;s) administration is going to organize things, get rid of regulatory barriers, and have American leadership through innovation, be one of the things that he gets behind.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gates met with the then-president-elect face-to-face in <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/310151-bill-gates-to-meet-with-trump\">New York&rsquo;s Trump Tower later that day</a> for about an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was a good time,&quot; Gates said afterward. &quot;We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that tweet? Despite what scads of disreputable websites report, it never happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note:</em><em>&nbsp;The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&nbsp;supports PolitiFact&#39;s initiative to fact-check&nbsp;claims about global health and development.
