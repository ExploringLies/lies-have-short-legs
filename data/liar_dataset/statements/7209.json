Robert Menendez.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRaising his voice, the New Jersey Democrat offered that comparison during a Dec. 27 speech on the Senate floor in regard to a $60.4 billion aid package for Sandy victims. The Senate approved the package Dec. 28, but the House has delayed action on the funding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I want my colleagues to remember that 10 days after Hurricane Katrina, this chamber passed two separate bills amounting to $60 billion,&quot; Menendez said. &quot;It has been nearly two months since we had Superstorm Sandy and nothing has passed.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMenendez is right.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, the Republican-controlled Congress approved two bills providing $62.3 billion in emergency funding, and President George W. Bush immediately signed them into law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this fact-check, we&rsquo;re not comparing the levels of damage caused by Katrina and Sandy. Our focus is on the timing of emergency appropriations approved by Congress.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s how the timing breaks down:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKatrina made landfall Aug. 29, 2005, near Buras, La., and continued north toward New Orleans, leaving about 80 percent of the city flooded, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Sept. 2, 2005, Congress passed a bill to provide $10.5 billion in emergency funding for disaster relief related to Hurricane Katrina. Then, on Sept. 8, 2005, Congress passed another bill for an additional $51.8 billion in emergency appropriations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, 10 days after Katrina reached New Orleans, Congress had approved $62.3 billion in emergency funding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, let&rsquo;s talk about federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandy made landfall near Atlantic City on Oct. 29, ultimately damaging more than 70,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey alone, The Star-Ledger has reported. Parts of New York and Connecticut suffered extensive damage as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Dec. 7, President Obama requested $60.4 billion in emergency appropriations to assist the states affected by Sandy. In a 62-32 vote on Dec. 28, the Democrat-controlled Senate approved that amount.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut around the same time when the GOP-led House passed legislation dealing with the so-called &quot;fiscal cliff,&quot; Speaker John Boehner canceled a vote on the disaster relief Tuesday night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoehner is expected to schedule a vote tomorrow on $9 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program and another vote on Jan. 15 for the remaining $51 billion in the aid package.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a Dec. 27 speech on the Senate floor, Menendez said that &quot;10 days after Hurricane Katrina, this chamber passed two separate bills amounting to $60 billion. It has been nearly two months since we had Superstorm Sandy, and nothing has passed.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe senator&rsquo;s claim is on the mark. Within 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana in August 2005, Congress approved two separate bills providing a total of $62.3 billion in disaster relief funding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Senate on Dec. 28 approved a $60.4 billion aid package for Hurricane Sandy, but the House has delayed action on the emergency funding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/01/politifact_nj_with_sandy_aid_o.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-02T15:21:16.716458", "ruling_date": "2013-01-03T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Sen.
