Scott Walker, raised that issue in response to a question posed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a news article published <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/270808651.html?ipad=y\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Aug. 11, 2014</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Journal Sentinel asked: &quot;Common Core: Should Wisconsin scrap or modify these academic standards for students? If so, should the state cover the costs of doing so for schools?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke replied by saying, in part:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Common Core is an opportunity, if implemented correctly, to make sure our young people are ready for the workplace or college. Students will have the critical thinking skills needed to compete with students in any state or any country. We absolutely need higher standards in Wisconsin &ndash;- we are currently 38th in the country in terms of proficiency standards &ndash;- and implementing Common Core correctly will do just that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s see if, on a national scale, Wisconsin&rsquo;s standards are relatively weak. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Federal statistics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One authority on proficiency standards is the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s National Center for Education Statistics, which does <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/studies/statemapping/about.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;mapping studies.&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>States develop their own assessments and set their own standards as to what it means for a student to be proficient. What the mapping studies do is compare each state&#39;s standard for proficient performance by placing the various state standards onto a common scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/studies/2011458.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>latest mapping study</u></a> was done in 2011, based on data from 2009. Results from<strong> </strong>testing of fourth- and eighth-graders on reading and math were used. The study found that the proficiency standards set by most states are at or below what the U.S. Department of Education defines as Basic. Basic is defined as &quot;partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no ranking of how states and the District of Columbia fared overall. But there was a ranking by grade and subject.

Unfortunately, their failure to provide grade-specific expectations creates critical gaps in content that leave teachers without the guidance they need to drive rigorous curriculum, assessment and instruction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For math standards, Wisconsin received an F. The math standards &quot;are scant,&quot; the institute said. &quot;They are provided only for the end of fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades, and very few standards are provided for each grade band.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peterson, the professor who ranked Wisconsin 38th, told us that since Wisconsin has adopted Common Core, its future ranking could change once it administers tests with the new definitions for proficiency.
