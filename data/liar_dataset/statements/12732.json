Mike Pence repeated a talking point about his economic record back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before,&quot; Pence said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s similar to a comment Pence had made just over a week earlier, shortly before Trump chose him as his running mate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistic <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/mike-pence/mike-pence-offers-misleading-statistic-employment-/\">isn&rsquo;t as meaningful as it sounds</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence has a point that more people in Indiana are working today than at any time in history -- 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here&rsquo;s a chart showing BLS data for Indiana as far back as the database goes online:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/81mLi9E2N6gJwk_AnfSfgNzdpULKTXpkoGxKQGw5iidlW5ycOqLZy3_6ALbYfHU4wLNhOzO5XsNvzwhJu3wuVHzAxXGFgfcJVzGqmd5dIhCHORoWWtafikrfTzLvFEWSSKBUqyvc\" style=\"border:none; height:264px; width:523px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the historical peak Pence cites has more to do with long-term population growth than with the robustness of the economy. Economists agree that the most accurate way to analyze a statement like this is to look at the percentage of people working, not the raw number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, you could say that President Barack Obama at the depths of the Great Recession was presiding over a healthier job market than Ronald Reagan in his second term, because 25 percent more Americans were working. The difference was that the base U.S. population -- rather than job prospects -- grew substantially in the interim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a general rule, &quot;focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading,&quot; Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed, told us when we looked at Pence&rsquo;s earlier comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what happens if you calculate the percentage of the Indiana population that is working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">2015 population estimate</a> &mdash; the most recent one available &mdash; Indiana has a population of about 6.48 million. So 47.3 percent of Indiana residents were working this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, at the previous raw-number peak in Indiana employment -- <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/maps/files/tab02.pdf\">May 2000</a> -- there were 3.02 million residents working. That year, the state had 6.08 million residents, so the percentage working was 49.7 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, a bigger percentage of Indiana&rsquo;s population was working in 2000 than in 2016. That throws some cold water on Pence&rsquo;s assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These calculations use all Indiana residents as a baseline, regardless of age, but the same pattern holds if you just look at Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64, the prime working years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, 75.4 percent of Indiana residents in that age range are working. In <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-12.pdf\">2000</a>, the comparable figure was 80.5 percent. So by this measure, too, Pence is wrong about 2016 representing a historical peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the more traditional measure of the health of the job market, the unemployment rate. This statistic uses as its baseline the number of people who are looking for a job, which makes it even more precise and in most cases more useful to economists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana&rsquo;s current unemployment rate of 5 percent is what experts would generally consider good, but it&rsquo;s hardly a historical low for Indiana. For most of the time between 1993 and 2008, Indiana&rsquo;s unemployment was right around 5 percent and often even lower. Here&rsquo;s a chart going back to 1976:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/y1_AjmLZGek7Z5j2LjjC4qgerxOw29iUXverKkj4zy7oRXyqI6kgH0Awk5uTI4Ni5mc4zwUvrhEJSwD5KVdvn06V4SC_p7zCyFIzy4PvlVZVtIj9LNm-uYvycrez7y3b8ldo-t1J\" style=\"border:none; height:287px; width:501px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, noticed another pattern in the numbers. He used federal data to determine that even though the state&rsquo;s working-age population grew by 311,000 between 2000 and 2015, the number of people actually working in the state increased by far less over that period -- only 45,400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That does not seem like an obvious sign of a strong employment trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence said, &quot;There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literally, more Indiana residents are employed now than at any time in the past. But it&rsquo;s a data point with very little meaning, since, as any statistician will tell you, it doesn&rsquo;t take into account the size of the state&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking instead at the percentage of Hoosiers working shows that the percentage was higher during the previous employment peak in 2000. And the widely used unemployment rate &mdash; which is even more precise because it is based on the number of residents who are actively looking for a job &mdash; has been lower than its current rate over long stretches of recent history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2078352d-5a91-4bdf-9872-462839fd76b5\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2078352d-5a91-4bdf-9872-462839fd76b5</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-20T23:09:13.490436", "ruling_date": "2016-07-20T23:07:32", "ruling_headline": "Mike Pence says there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-pence-says-there-are-more-hoosiers-going-work", "ruling_link_text": "Percentage working is what matters, not raw number", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mike Pence, remarks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/mike-pence/mike-pence-offers-misleading-statistic-employment-/\">Mike Pence offers misleading statistic on employment peak in Indiana</a>,&quot; July 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ce\">Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National)</a>&quot;, accessed July 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/sae/\">State and Metro Area Employment, Hours, &amp; Earnings</a>,&quot; accessed July 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/\">Local Area Unemployment Statistics</a>,&quot; accessed July 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex for the United States, States, Counties, and Puerto Rico Commonwealth and Municipios: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015 &nbsp;more information</a>,&quot; accessed July 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/maps/files/tab02.pdf\">Table 2.
