Sheldon Whitehouse has been promoting the idea that congressional Republicans who blocked climate change legislation are out of touch with Republicans throughout the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 25, PolitiFact Rhode Island gave a Mostly True ruling <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/nov/25/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-most-young-republic/\"><u>on </u><u>Whitehouse&rsquo;s </u><u>claim</u></a> that, in a poll, &quot;53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as &#39;ignorant,&#39; &#39;out of touch&#39; or &#39;crazy.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whitehouse repeated his assertion about young Republicans in a slightly different way during his <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/speeches/republicans-outside-of-congress-support-action-on-climate-change\"><u>Dec. 17 speech</u></a> on climate, his 53rd, focusing on the attitudes of the tea party faction of the Republican Party. He cited a poll that looked at all Republicans, not just those under age 35.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Another national survey, this one by the Pew Research Center, found that most -- 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans -- actually agree, actually agree there is &#39;solid evidence the earth is warming,&#39; with a plurality saying it is &#39;mostly because of humans,&#39;&quot; Whitehouse said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But the tea partiers are different,&quot; he added. &quot;Seventy percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is &#39;No solid evidence&#39; the earth is warming. And 41 percent of tea partiers assert that warming is &#39;Just not happening.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unfortunately here in Congress,&quot; he said later in the speech, &quot;the dark, heavy hand of the polluters is helping the tea party drive the Republican Party off the cliff.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was Whitehouse correctly characterizing the attitudes of Republicans in general and members of the tea party in particular?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went back to <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/11-1-13%20Global%20Warming%20Release.pdf\"><u>the Pew survey</u></a> to look at those numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew conducted the poll of 1,504 adults from Oct. 9-13, 2013; 655 said they were Republicans or leaned Republican, and 304 of them identified with the tea party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked whether there is &quot;solid evidence the earth is warming,&quot; 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans said yes; just 25 percent of tea party supporters said yes. (The margin of error for tea party numbers is plus or minus 6.5 percentage points and 6.2 percentage points for non-tea party Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Whitehouse quoted the findings accurately, within the margin of error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whitehouse was also correct when he said that 70 percent of tea party members responding said there is no solid evidence that Earth is warming, with 41 percent saying it&#39;s just not happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, a mere 13 percent of other Republicans said it&#39;s &quot;just not happening.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet just because Republicans think there&#39;s good evidence that Earth is warming doesn&#39;t mean they think human activity is responsible. That&#39;s an important point to consider when looking at whether members of the GOP support trying to do something to reverse the trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among non-tea party Republicans who thought the planet is warming, nearly 40 percent said it was due to natural patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheldon Whitehouse said that &quot;61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree . . . there is &#39;solid evidence the earth is warming,&#39; . . . [but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is &#39;no solid evidence&#39; the earth is warming.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The senator was accurately quoting the results of the October Pew poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&#39;s more to the story if you want to understand the ongoing opposition to climate change legislation by supporters of the GOP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many non-tea party Republicans acknowledge that climate change is occurring, a majority (54 percent) still either deny climate change or think it is part of a natural cycle not caused by human activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s an important factor to consider, which Whitehouse omitted.
