Original scheduled completion: 2016. The completion date if the state receives an applied-for <a href=\"http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/about-wisdot/newsroom/news-rel/103017-infra-grant-.aspx\">$246 million federal grant</a>: 2021. The completion date without the federal grant: 2032. The state is still waiting to hear whether it will receive all, some or none of its request.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>I-94 East-West. The safety and congestion problems that prompted state transportation officials to plan the reconstruction and widening of I-94 between 16th and 70th streets in Milwaukee will not be dealt with now that the project has been <a href=\"https://preview.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2017/10/06/94-east-west-safety-problems-remain-place-after-expansion-project-abandoned/739093001/\">abandoned</a>.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>I-43 North-South (Silver Spring Drive. to Wis. 60), Glendale to Grafton - Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties. &quot;This project has been put on <a href=\"http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/projects/by-region/se/43crdr/default.aspx\">hold</a> until further notice,&quot; according to an October 2015 announcement on the Wisconsin Department of Transportation website.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>I-94 between U.S. Highway 12 and State Highway 65 (St. Croix County). Work on the federally-designated truck route between the Twin Cities and St. Croix County was included in the 2017-&#39;19 budget by lawmakers, but <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/budget/2017_19_biennal_budget/033_comparative_summary_of_provisions_2017_act_59_entire_document\">vetoed</a> by Walker.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, Walker&rsquo;s team highlighted cases where -- once contracts have been issued -- work was completed earlier than expected, while Thompson noted delayed by broader funding issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Walker&rsquo;s tweet did not make such a distinction clear. It was a broad claim. And -- as many of the Twitter responses indicated -- &nbsp;that&rsquo;s how many people understood it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ex-DOT secretary waved caution flag</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then-DOT Secretary Mark Gottlieb told state lawmakers at a <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/republicans-grill-dot-secretary-walker-roads-budget\">December 2016 </a>hearing that the conditions of Wisconsin&rsquo;s highways would worsen if funding trends continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Walker&rsquo;s budget at the time, 21 percent of Wisconsin&rsquo;s highway system was projected to be in poor condition by 2018, he said. By 2027, that number would grow to 42 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gottlieb had at times called for increasing taxes and fees to pay for highways. Walker has said he won&rsquo;t raise gas taxes or vehicle fees unless an equivalent cut is made in other taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gottlieb <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/27/transportation-secretary-gottlieb-step-down/95877780/\">stepped down</a> less than a month after he told lawmakers Wisconsin&rsquo;s roads would worsen under Walker&#39;s plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2017, Walker signed the two-year, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/09/21/gov-scott-walker-sign-76-b-wisconsin-budget-money-schools-fees-hybrids/688388001/\">$76 billion budget</a>. It borrows $402 million for transportation infrastructure, far less than included in recent budgets. The plan delays work on Highway 15 in Outagamie County and the north leg of the Zoo Interchange in Milwaukee County and puts off the reconstruction of I-94 between the Zoo and Marquette interchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reduction in funding for interstates in southeast Wisconsin did a U-turn with the announcement of Foxconn locating in southeast Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state is pinning its hopes for the expanded freeway and related work on a $246.2 million <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/16/wisconsin-seeking-big-share-federal-grant-program-pay-94-south-milwaukee/958257001/\">federal grant</a> from the U.S. Department of Transportation that would pay for about half the remaining cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a tweet, Walker said &quot;Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman said Walker was referring to the early completion of the State Highway 441 project.
