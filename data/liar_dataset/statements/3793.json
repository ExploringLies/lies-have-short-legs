In those years, according to the city&rsquo;s online database summarizing City Council election results, five second-place finishers in general elections won their runoffs: Beverly Griffith (1996); Bill Spelman and Willie Lewis (1997); Raul Alvarez (2000); and Jennifer Kim (2005).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, only two closed a first-round gap of more than 4,000 votes. Spelman bested Manuel Zuniga after trailing by 8,813 votes in their initial race. Kim overtook Margot Clarke after Clarke ran 7,771 votes ahead in the general election. The other runoff victors earlier ran behind by about 1,100 to nearly 2,100 votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAustin consultant Mark Littlefield, a Shade supporter, agreed that just the two candidates rebounded after lagging by more than 4,000 votes. He said Spelman is the sole council hopeful in the period who bounced back from a greater percentage deficit than the nearly 13.5 points separating Shade and Tovo in this year&rsquo;s general election, though Kim was behind about 13 points in her first round.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShade spokeswoman Lynda Rife told us: &quot;The meaty part (of Shade&rsquo;s statement) is there&rsquo;s precedent for coming back.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLittlefield also noted that three of the comeback candidates drew a greater number of votes in the second round than they got facing crowded fields in their general elections--though turnout was diminished. Kim&rsquo;s vote haul increased 21 percent, Spelman&rsquo;s runoff total bumped up 41 percent and Griffith enjoyed a 71 percent improvement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnything could happen in the Tovo-Shade runoff; we&rsquo;re not making predictions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPer recent history, though, Shade&rsquo;s claim is off. Two comparable comebacks do not amount to &quot;several.&quot; And by percentage of votes cast, only one candidate in the last 15 years made up a deficit as large as Shade&rsquo;s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate her statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-23T16:29:00.245612", "ruling_date": "2011-05-26T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Randi Shade says several council candidates in last 15 years have come back from larger deficits than hers", "ruling_headline_slug": "randi-shade-says-several-council-candidates-last-1", "ruling_link_text": "Shy of several", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCity of Austin, web pages, past election results, <a href=\"http://malford.ci.austin.tx.us/election/byrecord.cfm?eid=59\">May 1996 general election</a>;
