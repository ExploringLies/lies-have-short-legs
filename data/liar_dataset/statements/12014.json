Clinton countered Sunday night that the case of President Barack Obama shows you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had,&quot; she said. &quot;And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulations since the Great Depression, with the Dodd-Frank regulations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this fact-check, we&#39;re looking at whether Obama set a record for campaign donations from Wall Street in 2008. Given the context, we&#39;re only looking at direct contributions made to candidates, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin cited a <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/02/obama-white-house-full-of-wall-street-executives/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2012 analysis</u></a> by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign donations. It found that Obama received <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=F&amp;cycle=2008&amp;recipdetail=A&amp;mem=Y&amp;sortorder=U\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$44.3 million</u></a> in 2008 from the &quot;finance, insurance and real estate&quot; sector. Four years earlier, George W. Bush had received <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=F&amp;cycle=2004&amp;recipdetail=P&amp;mem=N&amp;sortorder=U\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$36&nbsp;million</u></a>. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Adjusted for inflation</u></a>, Bush received $41.1 million in 2008 dollars, making Bush and Obama close, but still putting Obama ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the &quot;finance, insurance and real estate&quot; sector includes industries that go beyond what people traditionally think of as Wall Street. The Center for Responsive Politics <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/may/24/american-future-fund/american-future-fund-wall-street-obama/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>has told PolitiFact</u></a> that the best way to determine what Wall Street is donating is to look at donations from the &quot;securities and investment&quot; category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By that measure, Obama received $17.3 million in 2008 (with Republican Sen. John McCain a distant second at $9.7 million and Clinton in that cycle at third, at $7.5 million). Four years earlier, George W. Bush received $10&nbsp;million, which is $11.4 million in 2008 dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when it comes to Wall Street contributions, Obama broke the record in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Obama&#39;s support of financial reform may have cost him. When he ran for reelection in 2012, Wall Street sent him $10 million less. He received $7 million for that election cycle. It was Republican Mitt Romney who set the new record &mdash; $23.7 million, which would be $22.2 in 2008 dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, for the record, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=F07&amp;cycle=2016&amp;recipdetail=P&amp;mem=N&amp;sortorder=U\">in the current race</a>, the most recent data supplied by the center&#39;s website, OpenSecrets.org, shows Clinton with $3.4 million from the securities and investment industry, Marco Rubio with $1.6 million, Ted Cruz with $754,583, John Kasich with $274,317 and Sanders with $108,761.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adjusting for inflation, Obama garnered about $3 million more than George W. Bush if you look at the broad &quot;finance, insurance and real estate&quot; sector. But using the &quot;securities and investment&quot; category, a tighter measure of Wall Street contributions, Obama clearly set a new record in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet that record only lasted four years.&nbsp;Romney upped that ante by $5 million in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/politifactgive\" style=\"color: rgb(63, 99, 158);
