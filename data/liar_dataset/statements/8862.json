Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, recently spent three days in Cuba -- the longtime socialist adversary of the United States -- to learn more about the island nation&rsquo;s health care system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years, some health policy specialists in the United States have been intrigued by Cuba&rsquo;s health care system. Cuba produces a disproportionate number of doctors, and it has posted relatively strong health statistics in international comparisons, especially considering the country&rsquo;s shortage of material goods and economic wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some liberals, Cuba&rsquo;s health care system has offered an alternative to the one in the United States, where millions of Americans have struggled without insurance in recent years. Notably, Michael Moore&rsquo;s 2007 health care documentary <em>Sicko </em>includes scenes where Americans in need of medical attention travel to Havana and are treated for free at a high-quality hospital. Critics have countered that such free, quality care is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2007/06/23/148897/cuban-healthcare-is-painted-rosy.html\"><u>available only to the communist elite</u></a>, not to ordinary Cubans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harkin certainly saw something promising in Cuba&rsquo;s health care system. During a press conference upon his return to Washington on Jan. 29, 2014, Harkin -- who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee --&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/sen-tom-harkin-visits-cuba-is-pretty-impressed-with-its-public-health-system-20140129\"><u>said</u></a> that Cuba is a &quot;poor country, but they have a lower child mortality rate than ours. Their life expectancy is now greater than ours. It&#39;s interesting &mdash; their public health system is quite remarkable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether these statistics are accurate, and what they say about health care in Cuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Child mortality statistics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On child mortality, we found a few data sources that are generally considered credible.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html\"><u>According to the CIA Factbook</u></a>, Cuba infant mortality rate is indeed lower -- an estimated 4.76 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013, compared to 5.90 for the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And more precisely given the phrase Harkin chose, Cuba also has a better <em>child </em>mortality rate -- that is, the likelihood of death under 5 years of age.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/EXCEL_FILES/3_Mortality/WPP2012_MORT_F01_2_Q5_BOTH_SEXES.XLS\"><u>According to the World Health Organization</u></a>, Cuba had 6 deaths under age 5 per 1,000 live births between 2005 and 2010, compared to 8 deaths for the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So on child mortality, Harkin had his numbers right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Life expectancy statistics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data for life expectancy appears to be mixed.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html\"><u>According to both the CIA Factbook</u></a>, the estimated life expectancy for both sexes in 2013 was 78.62 in the United States, compared to 78.05 years in Cuba. And&nbsp;<a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688\"><u>according to the World Health Organization</u></a>, life expectancy in 2011 was 79 years in the United States and 78 in Cuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By these sources, Harkin would be wrong. But when we contacted Harkin&rsquo;s office, they pointed us to data from <a href=\"http://ais.paho.org/chi/brochures/2012/BI_2012_ENG.pdf\"><u>Pan American Health Organization</u></a> that backed up their claim. For 2012, the group found that life expectancy was 79.2 years in Cuba, compared to 78.8 years in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So for life-expectancy numbers, the data is varied, with some supporting Harkin and some not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How reliable is this data?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered, however, whether the data from Cuba&rsquo;s authoritarian government could be trusted. As we looked into it, we heard a measure of skepticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find one area of agreement: Cuba puts a lot of emphasis on its health data. Richard H Streiffer, dean of the College of Community Health Sciences at the University of Alabama, said his conclusion from two visits to Cuba is that Cuban health practitioners are &quot;very compulsive about collecting data and reporting it regularly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a recent trip, Streiffer said, he spent time with a family doctor in a neighborhood clinic. &quot;Family doctors are mandated to collect certain data,&quot; he said. &quot;He had right on his wall a &lsquo;dashboard&rsquo; of data characterizing his practice -- an age/sex distribution; an age/sex distribution of the top 10 chronic diseases in his practice; a map of where his patients lived in the neighborhood. You don&#39;t find that in the US.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, some experts said that this obsession with statistics can be a two-edged sword when it comes to reliability. Some say Cuba is so concerned with its infant mortality and life-expectancy statistics that the government takes heavy-handed actions to protect their international rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cuba does have a very low infant mortality rate, but pregnant women are treated with very authoritarian tactics to maintain these favorable statistics,&quot; said Tassie Katherine Hirschfeld, the chair of the department of anthropology at the University of Oklahoma who spent nine months living in Cuba to study the nation&#39;s health system. &quot;They are pressured to undergo abortions that they may not want if prenatal screening detects fetal abnormalities. If pregnant women develop complications, they are placed in &lsquo;Casas de Maternidad&rsquo; for monitoring, even if they would prefer to be at home. Individual doctors are pressured by their superiors to reach certain statistical targets. If there is a spike in infant mortality in a certain district, doctors may be fired. There is pressure to falsify statistics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hirschfeld said she&rsquo;s &quot;a little skeptical&quot; about the longevity data too, since Cuba has so many risk factors that cause early death in other countries, from unfiltered cigarettes to contaminated water to a meat-heavy diet. In a more benign statistical quirk, Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Pittsburgh,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/weekinreview/27depalma.html?_r=0\"><u>suggests</u></a> that the flow of refugees could skew longevity statistics, since those births are recorded but the deaths are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transparency would help give the data more credibility, but the Cuban government doesn&rsquo;t offer much, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would take all Cuban health statistics with a grain of salt,&quot; Hirschfeld said. Organizations like the Pan-American Health Organization &quot;rely on national self-reports for data, and Cuba does not allow independent verification of its health claims.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rodolfo J. Stusser -- a physician and former adviser to the Cuban Ministry of Public Health&#39;s Informatics and Tele-Health Division who left for Miami at age 64 -- is another skeptic. While Stusser acknowledges that Cuba has improved some of its health numbers since the revolution, the post-revolution data has been &quot;overestimated,&quot; he said. &quot;The showcasing of infant mortality and life expectancy at birth has been done for ideological reasons,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harkin said that Cuba has &quot;a lower child mortality rate than ours. Their life expectancy is now greater than ours.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the official statistics, Cuba does beat out the United States for both infant and child mortality, and on life expectancy, the data is mixed, with a slight edge to the United States. However, the combination of the Cuban government&rsquo;s heavy-handed enforcement of statistical targets and the lack of transparency has led some experts to suggest taking the numbers with a grain of salt. On balance, we rate Harkin&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-31T14:34:04.184336", "ruling_date": "2014-01-31T15:29:24", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
