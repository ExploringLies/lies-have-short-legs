And since that never happened, it&rsquo;s also fake news that there were five family members inside that house who came out of the ordeal without major injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website called Daily Native American, dailynative.us, posted the <a href=\"http://dailynative.us/tornado-carries-mobile-home-130-miles-family-inside-unharmed/\">fabricated story</a> on Aug. 6, 2017, but the claims have circulated for years. Satirical website worldnewsdailyreport.com posted the <a href=\"http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/tornado-carries-mobile-home-130-miles-family-inside-unharmed/\">same story</a> back in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A family from Tulsa, Oklahoma, underwent the scariest experience of their life yesterday, when their mobile home was carried over 130 miles by a tornado, landing in a rural Kansas area. Five members of the same family were inside the building during its &lsquo;flight&rsquo;, and all of them have miraculously survived without injuries,&quot; said the dailynative.us post. &quot;41-year old Dorothy Williams, was at home with her husband, her son, and her two brothers, when their mobile home was lifted off the ground by an F4 tornado.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;story claims the tornado carried the house for more than four hours &quot;sometimes at altitude of more than 1,000 feet,&quot; across northern Colorado, southern Kansas and then dropped it on a car outside of Wichita, &quot;129.5 miles (208.5 kilometers) away from its point of origin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration what they thought of the dailynative.us post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s not possible,&quot; said Harold Brooks, senior research scientist at NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#About\">Most tornadoes</a> last less than 10 minutes and travel an average 3.5 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories of papers, checks and other feather-light objects traveling 100 miles <a href=\"http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#About\">do sometimes check out</a>. But heavy objects cannot cover the same ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brooks said even in the &quot;most violent events,&quot; wind could not usher a Tulsa mobile home northwest over Colorado before landing near Wichita in southern Kansas. &quot;That&rsquo;s a rare direction for even paper to get thrown over significant distances,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dailynative.us does not feature an &quot;About Us&quot; page detailing who&rsquo;s behind it or what is it&rsquo;s purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allusions to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> did not go unnoticed to some readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sorry is it just me or has someone else heard all this before? &hellip;Dorothy? The house lands safely (somewhere in Kansas)? &hellip; was she wearing red shoes by any chance? And was there a wicked witch in the car that the house landed on?&quot; wrote a worldnewsdailyreport.com reader in August 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A post from dailynative.us headlined, &quot;Tornado carries mobile home 130 miles, family inside unharmed&quot; is fake.
