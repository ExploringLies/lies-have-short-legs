We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now.&quot; (Later in the roundtable discussion, Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter repeated the statistic, but we&#39;ll check Toomey&#39;s quote here.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wondered whether the U.S. really has the highest corporate tax rates in the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsing the most straightforward definition of &quot;corporate tax rates,&quot; Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/56/33717459.xls\" id=\"vo6b\" title=\"ranks\">ranks</a> the &quot;combined corporate income tax rate&quot; in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor 2010, the U.S ranks second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut before we declare Toomey&#39;s statement True, let&#39;s dig a little deeper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe OECD rate is the &quot;statutory&quot; rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the &quot;effective tax rate.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe World Bank <a href=\"http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/special-reports/paying-taxes-2011\" id=\"j-ag\" title=\"has assembled data\">has assembled data</a> from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that&#39;s still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand produced a higher effective rate in the World Bank study. And Japan&#39;s number should fall by the time next year&#39;s study comes out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&#39;s also broader context that Toomey doesn&#39;t get into. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/29/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-us-not-undertaxed-compared-its-c/\" id=\"swtj\" title=\"In a previous item\">In a previous item</a>, we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn&#39;t rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, if you rate Toomey on his specific wording by looking at &quot;corporate tax rates,&quot; he&#39;s right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists&#39; typical yardstick. So we rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-03T16:51:42.073192", "ruling_date": "2011-01-03T16:50:19", "ruling_headline": "Pat Toomey says U.S. has highest corporate tax rates in the world", "ruling_headline_slug": "pat-toomey-says-us-has-highest-corporate-tax-rates", "ruling_link_text": "Sayonara, Japan.
