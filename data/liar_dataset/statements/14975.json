Brian Kavanagh claimed New York state has one of the lowest gun death rates in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;New York has the third-lowest rate of gun-caused death in America,&quot; Kavanagh said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kavanagh, a Democrat who represents the Brooklyn waterfront and Lower Manhattan, has introduced legislation that would allow a judge to temporarily restrict someone&rsquo;s gun rights. Family members or law enforcement officials could ask for such an order for those they believe to be a danger to themselves or others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kavanagh said his bill would make New York state an even safer place to live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is he right that the state already ranks third lowest in gun-caused deaths?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Data on gun deaths</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks firearm mortality by state each year. The data includes suicides, homicides&nbsp;and accidental gun deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state reported that 4.4 of every 100,000 residents died from gun-related causes in 2016. Only Rhode Island and Massachusetts had lower rates. Massachusetts was lowest, with 3.4 gun-related deaths for every 100,000 residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alaska had&nbsp;the highest gun death rate, with 23.3 of every 100,000 people dying from gun-related causes in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state reported 900 gun deaths in 2016, the 17th highest number in the country. Texas had the most, with 3,353 such deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in the data?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than half of those who died from gun-related causes in New York state took their own life in 2016. The state reported 490 suicides. That said,&nbsp;New York had the third-lowest rate of suicidal gun deaths &nbsp;-- 2.5 for every 100,000 residents. Montana had 15.5 suicide&nbsp;gun deaths for every 100,000 residents, the highest in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state ranked higher in gun homicides. About two out of every 100,000 people were killed by a firearm assault in New York state in 2016. Seven states had lower rates, and six other states had so few gun homicides&nbsp;that the CDC considered their calculated death rates unreliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kavanagh said &quot;New York has the third-lowest rate of gun-caused death in America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government figures confirm Kavanagh&rsquo;s claim. Only two other states rank lower than New York state in gun deaths. New York state also ranks third lowest in suicidal gun deaths, though the state&rsquo;s rank climbs when assaults are considered alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-30T14:43:31.833030", "ruling_date": "2018-02-01T11:29:13", "ruling_headline": "Rate of gun-caused deaths in NY among lowest in the country", "ruling_headline_slug": "rate-gun-caused-deaths-ny-among-lowest-country", "ruling_link_text": "Only two other states rank lower", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email conversation with Jack Sterne, spokesperson for Kavanagh</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm\">Firearm mortality rate by state, Centers for Disease Control</a>, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detailed firearm mortality rates obtained using the CDC WONDER mortality database, accessed Jan. 23, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "State Senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Brian", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "New York", "id": 4185, "last_name": "Kavanagh", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "brian-kavanagh", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kavanagh_Thumbnail.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4185/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/brian-kavanagh"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;New York has the third lowest rate of gun-caused death in America.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press conference", "statement_date": "2018-01-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "How does NY compare to other states in gun-caused deaths?"}
