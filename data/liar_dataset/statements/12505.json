A second, broader definition in the same dictionary seemed to better match Ryan&rsquo;s argument: &quot;an alliance of parties or interests to further common aims.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The word &lsquo;cartel&rsquo; in the tweet is a figure of speech,&quot; Martorana said, &quot;referring to the fact that the federal government controls the supply of higher education through the accreditation process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martorana noted that to qualify for federal aid, schools must be accredited by a private educational association that has been certified by the Department of Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-advances-transparency-agenda-accreditation\">acknowledges</a> accreditation plays a &quot;gatekeeping&quot; role in access to the annual $150 billion spent on federal student aid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Accreditors are responsible for ensuring baseline levels of acceptable quality and performance across diverse institutions, degree types, and academic programs,&quot; the department said in a 2015 news release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that does not mean the private accreditation firms are working with the government &mdash; nor that the <a href=\"http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/agencies.aspx\">more than 60 active accreditors</a>, which are private entities, are working together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not sure how they constitute a cartel,&quot; said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of Colleges and State Universities. &quot;If by cartel you mean a group that gets together behind closed doors to set policy, that does not happen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, there are approximately 4,200 accredited colleges and universities in the United States. And they compete against each other for students, government aid and grant money. Each institution decides what degrees to offer and what is required to attain them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, anyone can create a college &mdash; the accreditation only comes in as a means for students to get federal student loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As we know from Trump &lsquo;University&rsquo; and from McDonald&rsquo;s &lsquo;University,&rsquo; you can use it as a euphemism,&quot; Nassirian said. &quot;You can use it in any context you want to. And nobody stops you from awarding whatever degree you want to award.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also turned to somehow who knows cartels well &mdash; Ellen R. Wald, an expert on the OPEC oil cartel and a professor of social science at Jacksonville University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She defines cartel as &quot;a group of companies or countries that coordinate and collude to set prices by increasing or decreasing production in unison.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no indication that universities collude to determine the number of diplomas granted, let alone the price, she said. If they appear to act in unison, it is because they are responding to the same government regulation and accreditation requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only example in which universities coordinate to set prices is the Ivy League&#39;s decision to prohibit scholarships that are not need-based, which has the effect of raising overall prices,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even then, the eight Ivy League schools are only a tiny portion of the 4,200 accredited institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan called to break up the &quot;college cartel,&quot; implying that collusion is preventing better options from entering the higher education market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is true that the accreditation process acts as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; of federal student aid, but that is a policy standard and, in practice, is different than a cartel which would require collusion between institutions and many other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression, we rate the claim Mostly False.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/060b4ac4-b038-4783-aeff-ab62c05fe309\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/060b4ac4-b038-4783-aeff-ab62c05fe309</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-12T13:27:51.744952", "ruling_date": "2016-06-16T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Is Paul Ryan right that American colleges amount to \u2018a cartel\u2019?", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-ryan-right-american-colleges-amount-cartel", "ruling_link_text": "Comparison misses the mark", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange with Ian Martorana, Speaker Paul Ryan&rsquo;s press secretary, May 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Ellen Wald, professor of social science at Jacksonville University, June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis, American Associations of Colleges and State Universities, May 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/speakerryan/status/731584895433084929\">@SpeakerRyan</a>, May 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/opinion/nocera-the-college-sports-cartel.html\">The College Sports Cartel</a>, December 30, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Review, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/293763/college-cartel-vance-h-fried-reihan-salam\">The College Cartel</a>, March 19, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collins Dictionary, <a href=\"http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cartel\">cartel</a> definition</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-education-advances-transparency-agenda-accreditation\">news release</a>, November 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Education, <a href=\"http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/agencies.aspx\">accrediting agencies</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/expanding_opportunity_in_america.pdf\">Expanding Opportunity in America</a>, July 24, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 24, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 373, "last_name": "Ryan", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "paul-ryan", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_WX201_HOUSE_2016_PRIMARI.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/373/", "total_count": 89, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.house.gov/ryan/"}, "statement": "<p>American colleges amount to a &quot;cartel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet", "statement_date": "2016-05-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Is Paul Ryan right that American colleges amount to \u2018a cartel\u2019?"}
