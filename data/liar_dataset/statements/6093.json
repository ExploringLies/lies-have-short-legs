Joe Kyrillos has tied U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to growth in the national debt and deficits. In an interview on NJTV&rsquo;s &quot;On the Record&quot; that aired June 8, Menendez, a Democrat, responded to those charges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well first of all, evidently my Republican opponent has selective memory,&quot; Menendez said, first citing growth in state debt under Kyrillos&rsquo; watch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen, Menendez said: &quot;Here&#39;s someone who raided the state&#39;s -- voted to raid the state&#39;s pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKyrillos helped pushed through a controversial plan in 1997 from then-Gov. Christie Whitman to sell nearly $2.8 billion in bonds in a bid to cover unfunded liabilities in the state&rsquo;s pension system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be clear, we are not ruling on whether the pension bonds were sound fiscal policy. We are also not ruling on Whitman&rsquo;s overall impact on the pension system. We&rsquo;re looking at two, specific claims: whether voting for the bonds constituted a $2.8 billion raid on the pension system and whether they are costing taxpayers $15 billion to pay off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth statements veer from the truth, PolitiFact New Jersey found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bond legislation -- approved on June 5, 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it -- authorized the state&rsquo;s Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, the proceeds of which were deposited in state retirement funds for public workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA separate, companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe move allowed Whitman to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance her budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMelissa Castro, a spokeswoman for the Menendez campaign, said &quot;skipping scheduled payments into the pension system is a raid of pension funds, because by definition, it is reducing the total funds available to pay the funds&#39; obligations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhitman skipped payments that year -- as she did in others -- but she put nearly $2.8 billion of borrowed money in the funds. That does not fit the definition of a raid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, what&rsquo;s the final price tag for those pension bonds, which mature in 2029?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMenendez put the tab at nearly $15 billion. According to the state Treasury Department, the bonds -- which the state is paying more than 7 percent interest on -- will cost $10.1 billion to pay off. The general fund shoulders the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreasury Department spokesman Andy Pratt said it&rsquo;s unfair to look at the expense of the bonds without also considering the investment interest the money is earning. The average rate of return has been 6.36 percent a year, Pratt said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, the state&rsquo;s general fund is still on the hook for $10.1 billion. In the upcoming budget, debt service on the bonds will cost nearly $300 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCastro said whether it was $15 billion or $10 billion, Menendez is still correct on his fundamental point. &quot;Nevertheless this is still bad fiscal policy,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMenendez said Kyrillos &quot;voted to raid the state&#39;s pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKyrillos voted in favor of borrowing $2.75 billion to put into the state&rsquo;s pension funds. The move allowed Whitman to avoid nearly $600 million in pension payments that year, but overall, money went into the system, not out of it. To call it a vote to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion is inaccurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, the bonds will cost taxpayers, in total, about $10.1 billion, not $15 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/robert_menendez_whitman_bonds.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-14T14:17:41.926532", "ruling_date": "2012-06-17T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Robert Menendez claims Joe Kyrillos voted to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion", "ruling_headline_slug": "robert-menendez-claims-joe-kyrillos-voted-raid-pen", "ruling_link_text": "$2.8B deposited into funds", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNJTV, <a href=\"http://watch.njtvonline.org/video/2243940834\">On the Record with U.S. Sen.
