A reader emailed us asking if Behar was accurately describing our rulings, so we took a closer look at the exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is the media supposed to not report on the fact that 95 percent of what he says is a lie?&quot; Behar asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The problem with that, Joy, is that is, you are doing exactly what we are talking about and pushing a false narrative,&quot; Sanders replied. &quot;Ninety-five percent of what the president says is not a lie.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, it&rsquo;s not,&quot; Behar said. &quot;It&rsquo;s from PolitiFact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appeared that Behar was referring to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Trump&rsquo;s PolitiFact file</a>, which tracks every statement we&rsquo;ve rated on the Truth-O-Meter. We compile the results of a person&#39;s most interesting or provocative statements in their file to provide a broad overview of the kinds of statements they tend to make.&nbsp;A spokeswoman for <em>The View</em> didn&rsquo;t clarify Behar&rsquo;s claim by our deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of Sept. 6, 21 of the 446 statements we examined earned a True rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That is only 5 percent. Does that mean he lied 95 percent of the time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a word, no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we appreciate being a part of a discussion about the facts, Behar wasn&rsquo;t using our file on Trump properly. Let&rsquo;s take some time to re-examine what the Truth-O-Meter does and doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Meter reader</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no question Trump has a shaky relationship with the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His campaign misstatements earned our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/21/2015-lie-year-donald-trump-campaign-misstatements/\">2015 Lie of the Year award</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/\">his Truth-O-Meter record was much worse</a> than Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His tendency to play loose with facts has continued into his presidency. We&rsquo;ve given him Pants On Fire ratings for gross distortions saying <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-charlottesville-counter-protest/\">Charlottesville, Va., counter-protesters didn&rsquo;t have a permit</a>; that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/03/donald-trump/trumps-pants-fire-claim-cnn-ratings-are-way-down/\">CNN&rsquo;s ratings have suffered mightily</a>; and that allegations his campaign colluded with Russia &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/12/donald-trump/trump-calls-trump-russia-story-made-/\">is a made-up story</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s also received False ratings for saying President Barack Obama&rsquo;s immigration policies <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/18/donald-trump/trump-falsely-claims-obama-policies-blame-growth-m/\">led to an upswing in MS 13 gang activity</a>; that his own administration did more <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/24/donald-trump/how-do-donald-trumps-first-100-days-rate-historica/\">in the first 90 days than any other presidency</a>; and that he&rsquo;s saved &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/26/donald-trump/did-donald-trumps-trip-create-or-save-millions-job/\">millions of jobs</a>&quot; since becoming president. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, he&rsquo;s earned 147 False ratings (33 percent of all the Trump rulings we&rsquo;ve made) and 69 Pants on Fire ratings (15 percent). Those statements are provably wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to call the rest lies, as Behar did, doesn&rsquo;t reflect the Truth-O-Meter&rsquo;s design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We define our ratings in our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">description of our fact-checking process</a>, which helps us determine the veracity of a statement we&rsquo;ve chosen to check:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRUE</strong> &ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong> &ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HALF TRUE </strong>&ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MOSTLY FALSE </strong>&ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FALSE</strong> &ndash; The statement is not accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PANTS ON FIRE </strong>&ndash; The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when we rate a statement something less than True but more than False, the speaker can be accurate to some degree, but incorrect because it&rsquo;s omitting an important angle, being used in the wrong context or drawing a bad conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example: When Trump tweeted in February, &quot;The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion,&quot; he was using a real statistic from the U.S. Treasury Department. He was clearly attempting to make it appear he was responsible for the decrease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts we interviewed said not only did the national debt fluctuate on a regular basis as it continued an inexorable upward climb, there was no way Trump enacted policies leading to the minor (and temporary) drop. We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/25/donald-trump/why-donald-trumps-tweet-about-decline-national-deb/\">rated Trump&rsquo;s tweet Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has received 52 Mostly True ratings, 64 Half True ratings, and 93 Mostly False ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also keep in mind that a person&rsquo;s PolitiFact file isn&rsquo;t a comprehensive look at every single statement they make, nor is it a random sample of what they say. It would be logistically impossible for PolitiFact to make informed rulings on every single comment an official makes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We choose to fact-check statements that are interesting to us or to readers, or that are relevant to policy discussions or the news of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content of the statements can sometimes repeat, as well, landing another rating in the file. We&rsquo;ve rated Trump&rsquo;s assertion that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-most-highly-taxed-nation-worl/\">America is the</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-says-us-has-highest-tax-rate-anywhere-world/\">highest-taxed</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/06/donald-trump/trump-calls-us-highest-taxed-country-world/\">nation in</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/\">the world</a> four times over two years, each earning a False rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not to beat a dead horse, but rather to address Trump&rsquo;s repetition of the falsehood during the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Behar said PolitiFact reported that &quot;95 percent of what (Trump) says is a lie.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a misreading of Trump&rsquo;s file, which notes that of the 446 statements we&rsquo;ve examined, only 5 percent earned a True rating. We&rsquo;ve rated Trump&rsquo;s statements False or Pants On Fire a total of 48 percent of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The definitions of our Truth-O-Meter ratings make it difficult to call the bulk of Trump&rsquo;s statements outright lies.<strong> </strong>The files we keep for people&#39;s statements act as a scorecard of the veracity of their most interesting claims. Keep in mind that the statements we rate are neither a random nor comprehensive look at things Trump has said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behar oversimplified when invoking our Truth-O-Meter rulings. We rate her statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-18T15:53:06.392144", "ruling_date": "2017-09-18T17:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Joy Behar claims that PolitiFact said Donald Trump lies 95 percent of the time", "ruling_headline_slug": "joy-behar-politifact-said-trump-lies-95-percent-ti", "ruling_link_text": "Remember what the Truth-O-Meter really does", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sarah-sanders-95-percent-president-lie/story?id=49653574\">Sarah Sanders: &#39;95 percent of what the president says is not a lie&#39;</a>,&quot; Sept. 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">The Principles of PolitiFact, PunditFact and the Truth-O-Meter</a>,&quot; Nov. 1, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/21/2015-lie-year-donald-trump-campaign-misstatements/\">2015 Lie of the Year: the campaign misstatements of Donald Trump</a>,&quot; Dec. 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump file</a>, accessed Sept. 18, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Joy", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4044, "last_name": "Behar", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "joy-behar", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/joybehar.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4044/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says PolitiFact reported that &quot;95 percent of what (Donald Trump) says is a lie.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on 'The View'", "statement_date": "2017-09-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 52, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/52/", "subject": "Pop Culture", "subject_slug": "pop-culture", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Joy Behar claimed @PolitiFact said @realDonaldTrump lies 95 percent of the time.
