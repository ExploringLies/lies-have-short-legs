China has, North Korea has and they have consistently over many, many years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House didn&rsquo;t reply to our emails seeking information to back Priebus&rsquo; statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts told us that, aside from the Chung affair, there is no evidence that China -- and certainly not North Korea -- have meddled in American elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what U.S. intelligence agencies say the Russians did is far different from the Chung matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Russia&rsquo;s meddling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is how the agencies began their key findings on Russian meddling in a <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\">January 2017 report</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow&rsquo;s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia&rsquo;s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As has been widely <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/22/all-possible-ties-between-trump-and-russia/\">reported</a>, Russian hackers stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and gave them to WikiLeaks. Russian actors gained access to several states&rsquo; electoral agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts believe that Russia was behind a misinformation and propaganda campaign pushing exaggerated or false stories that would spread on social media and get picked up by English-language conspiratorial websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, in July 2017, it was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/11/donald-trump-jr-emails-promise-sensitive-information-russia/467894001/\">reported</a> that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian agent who had promised to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton, and that the president&#39;s son knew the allegedly incriminating information was being peddled by the highest levels of the Russian government in order to support the Trump campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>China and North Korea</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dozen experts we contacted said they were aware of no evidence to back Priebus&rsquo; claim, or were aware only of the Chung matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Chung case, money was inappropriately or illegally given to a candidate&rsquo;s campaign account. Priebus&rsquo; claim suggests a much broader and government-orchestrated foreign effort, on par with the Russian one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s possible there is some classified intelligence report on China and North Korea and U.S. elections, but I have never heard this claim before, nor seen any evidence,&quot; said University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor <a href=\"https://faculty.polisci.wisc.edu/yherrera/\">Yoshiko Herrera</a>, who is the former director of the school&rsquo;s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Also, I think for both China and North Korea, they see little difference between U.S. presidential candidates, but rather think of American politicians in general as opposed to China&rsquo;s or North Korea&rsquo;s interests, so I don&rsquo;t know what the motivation for meddling in elections would be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Priebus&rsquo; claim struck some experts as bizarre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have never heard this charge before,&quot; said political science professor <a href=\"http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/polisci/facstaff/ross.html\">Robert Ross</a>, an associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts on North Korea were more blunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This notion that North Korea meddles in American elections is completely baseless,&quot; said <a href=\"https://history.osu.edu/people/lerner.26\">Mitchell Lerner</a>, director of the Institute for Korean Studies at Ohio State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s sort of a stunning assertion,&quot; said <a href=\"https://www.ssrc.org/staff/sigal-leon/\">Leon Sigal</a>, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. &quot;I just don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s coming from. There certainly is no evidence for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking to Russia&rsquo;s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Priebus said: &quot;It&#39;s an absolute fact&quot; that China and North Korea &quot;have consistently over many, many years&quot; meddled in U.S. elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s 1996 reelection campaign, money from Chinese citizens, including the head of China&rsquo;s military agency, was illegally funneled to the reelection effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is no evidence that either China or North Korea -- consistently and over many years -- meddled in U.S. elections. And certainly nothing on the scale of the Russian efforts in the 2016 presidential race, which reached to the highest levels of the Russian government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Priebus&rsquo; statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-13T12:34:57.071894", "ruling_date": "2017-07-13T12:38:05", "ruling_headline": "China and North Korea, 'consistently over many, many years,' have meddled in U.S. elections?", "ruling_headline_slug": "china-and-north-korea-consistently-over-many-many-", "ruling_link_text": "Evidence absolutely lacking for meddling on such a scale", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; Reince Priebus <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/07/09/reince-priebus-breaks-down-trumps-trip-to-g-20-summit.html\">interview</a> (4:25), July 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jul/06/17-intelligence-organizations-or-four-either-way-r/\">&quot;17 intelligence organizations or 4?
