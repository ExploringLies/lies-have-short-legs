Now both are campaign fodder in the race for a congressional seat on Long Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans are using Democrat Tom Suozzi&rsquo;s record on taxes as Nassau County Executive in the 3rd Congressional District race. One claim followed a newspaper report that two of the voter signatures collected to help get Suozzi on the ballot are from people who had already died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Long Island voters who are actually living and breathing are clearly still unhappy with Suozzi raising taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; Chris Pack of the National Republican Congressional Committee said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suozzi <a href=\"http://suozziforcongress.com/about-tom-suozzi\">served</a> as Nassau County Executive from 2002 to 2009. Before that he was the mayor of Glen Cove. He wants to succeed Democrat Rep. Steve Israel, who&rsquo;s not seeking re-election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He faces Republican Jack Martins, who has <a href=\"https://martinsforcongress.com/about/\">served</a> in the State Senate since 2011 and also was mayor of the village of Mineola for eight years before that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is the NRCC correct? Did Suozzi raise&nbsp;taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars when he was county executive?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Raising taxes in Nassau County</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Suozzi took office in 2002, Nassau County <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/opinion/nassau-s-tough-love-budget.html\">was</a> in rough financial shape, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/01/nyregion/in-nassau-county-a-small-election-will-settle-the-political-balance.html\">riddled with debt</a> amid a hiring freeze for non-essential workers. The county was trying to figure out how to recover from a fiscal crisis that started under the previous administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The county received <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/10/nyregion/pataki-proposes-a-fiscal-bailout-of-nassau-county.html?pagewanted=all\">a bailout</a> from the state, which also created an independent authority to monitor the financial condition of the county. That authority, the <a href=\"http://www.nifa.state.ny.us/about_NIFA.html\">Nassau County Interim Finance Authority</a>, has released reports on the county&rsquo;s finances since its creation in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To restore the county&rsquo;s financial footing, Suozzi pitched an unusually large tax increase of close to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/26/nyregion/suozzi-proposes-20-increase-in-taxes-for-nassau.html\">20 percent</a>. The county legislature approved it,and property taxes increased by more than $125 million for residents that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though steep, the increase helped stabilize the county&rsquo;s finances, at least in the short term, said E.J. McMahon of the Empire Center for Public Policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suozzi kept taxes mostly flat for the remainder of his time in office until 2009 when there was an <a href=\"https://nassaucountyny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/3914\">increase in property tax revenue</a> of close to 4 percent, or about $40 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suozzi also proposed a <a href=\"http://longisland.news12.com/news/legislature-passes-suozzi-s-heating-tax-proposal-1.8196523\">tax on energy use</a> for Nassau County residents during his second term. It passed the legislature and took effect in 2009. It <a href=\"http://archive.nassaucountyny.gov/agencies/CountyExecutive/NewsRelease/2010/2010-01-01b.html\">was repealed</a> after Suozzi lost re-election. The tax generated close to $40 million for the county before it went off the books in the second half of 2010, according to <a href=\"https://nassaucountyny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/3943\">documents</a> from the county&rsquo;s budget office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years after Suozzi lost the county executive&rsquo;s office, the state <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/nyregion/27nassau.html\">took control</a> of the county&rsquo;s finances again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee said in an online post that former Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi raised taxes by &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time in office, Suozzi raised taxes by more than $200 million by collecting more in property taxes and instituting an energy-use tax. The $40 million collected from the short-lived energy-use tax combined with the $160 million increase&nbsp;in property taxes brings the total above that threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim as True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2f67d8e2-d323-467a-8c1d-76f3447f58cf\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2f67d8e2-d323-467a-8c1d-76f3447f58cf</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-13T14:48:45.293464", "ruling_date": "2016-09-23T11:26:40", "ruling_headline": "Suozzi passed major tax hikes in Nassau County", "ruling_headline_slug": "suozzi-passed-major-tax-hikes-nassau-county", "ruling_link_text": "We looked at tax data", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/08/09/long-island-democrat-relying-on-dead-voters-to-make-the-ballot/\">Long Island Democrat relying on dead voters to make the ballot</a>, New York Post, Aug. 9, 2016, Accessed Aug. 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email and phone conversation with Chris Pack from the National Republican Congressional Committee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Matthew Fernando, Press Secretary for the Nassau County Legislature Majority (Republican)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Brian Butry from the State Comptroller&rsquo;s Office</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Carla Hall D&rsquo;Ambra, Director of Communications for the Nassau County Comptroller</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with E.J.
