Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rated one claim from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico, a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/02/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-solar-company-/\">Pants on Fire</a> falsehood. A second claim, on building traffic lights in China, we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c/\">Mostly&nbsp;False</a>. &nbsp;In this fact-check, we&rsquo;re examining if those tax credits included &quot;half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(We&#39;ve also checked many other exaggerations <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/subjects/stimulus/\">about the stimulus</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe ad said its source for the Finland claim was an ABC News article, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/car-company-us-loan-builds-cars-finland/story?id=14770875#.T57vacRYv2c\">Car Company Gets U.S. Loan, Builds Cars In Finland</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>A loan for U.S. work</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first clue something&rsquo;s wrong is in that ABC News headline. A car company got a &quot;U.S. loan.&quot; That&rsquo;s not the same thing as a tax credit. Taxpayers expect to get loan money back, with interest. (Though, they don&rsquo;t always. See: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/nov/15/americans-prosperity/solyndra-ad-president-barack-obama-taxpayer-money/\">Solyndra</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThings get even more wrong from there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?page_id=43\">U.S. loan program</a>? It&#39;s the&nbsp;Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program through the Energy Department. And it&#39;s not funded by Obama&rsquo;s stimulus bill &mdash; otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It is, in fact, a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/finalrule1.pdf\">in 2007</a> and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe program was designed to support development of advanced technology vehicles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bush administration was in charge when the automaker filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company&rsquo;s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, the ad could have raised relevant criticism of the Energy Department&rsquo;s loan programs. Watchdogs <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08750.pdf\">inside</a> and <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/search_by_tag.php?action=view&amp;proj_id=4861&amp;tag=loan%20guarantees&amp;type=Project\">outside</a> government have argued since the Bush administration that the programs haven&rsquo;t included safeguards sufficient to protect taxpayers. Instead, the ad says stimulus tax credits funded overseas jobs. That&rsquo;s the claim we&rsquo;re weighing here. And that&rsquo;s just not the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://media.fiskerautomotive.com/global/en-us/Company/FactSheet/Overview.aspx\">Fisker Automotive</a>, a U.S. automaker with global headquarters in Anaheim, Calif., got its <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-closing-529-million-loan-fisker-automotive\">$529 million federal loan</a> to develop and produce two lines of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles &mdash; the Karma and the Nina.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe project was expected to create about 2,000 &nbsp;jobs in Wilmington, Del., where the Nina would be manufactured, according to the Energy Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPart of the loan &mdash; $169 million &mdash; paid for design, engineering and other work <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/fisker-tesla-and-american-auto-innovation\">in the United States</a> on the Fisker Karma. A larger part &mdash; $359 million &mdash; was slated to help buy and reconfigure a shuttered General Motors plant in Delaware to build the Nina.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s where Finland enters the story: Before its Energy Department loans were approved, Fisker had decided it would manufacture the Karma at a plant in Finland. The company argued there simply <a href=\"http://media.fiskerautomotive.com/global/en-us/Media/PressRelease.aspx?mediaid=567&amp;title=fisker-statement-re-misleading-news-reports\">wasn&rsquo;t a U.S. plant available</a> for the type of car they were building. But 65 percent of the parts for the Karma, based on cost, <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/us-energy-secretary-chu-announces-528-million-loan-advanced-vehicle-technology-fisker\">would come from U.S. suppliers</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There was no contract manufacturer in the U.S. that could actually produce our vehicle,&quot; Henrik Fisker, the company&#39;s founder, told ABC News. &quot;They don&#39;t exist here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe loan for the design of the car &quot;was only used for the U.S. operations&quot; and could not be spent overseas, according to &nbsp;<a href=\"http://media.fiskerautomotive.com/global/en-us/Media/PressRelease.aspx?mediaid=567&amp;title=fisker-statement-re-misleading-news-reports\">Fisker</a> and the <a href=\"http://energy.gov/articles/fisker-tesla-and-american-auto-innovation\">Energy Department</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, most of the loan has yet to be disbursed. <a href=\"http://media.fiskerautomotive.com/global/en-us/Media/PressRelease.aspx?mediaid=678&amp;title=fact-sheet-fisker-karma-and-fisker-automotive\">Fisker says it stopped</a> taking loan money from the Energy Department in May 2011, after drawing $190 million &mdash; most of it for Karma design and development. Its Nina project, now called the Atlantic, has been delayed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>News Journal</em> in Wilmington, Del., reported the payments to Fisker stopped after the company failed to meet Energy Department milestones set as conditions for the loan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Our loan documents require borrowers to meet certain milestones and other conditions prior to receiving loan proceeds,&quot; department spokesman Damien LaVera told PolitiFact.&nbsp;&quot;As has been widely reported, Fisker has experienced some delays in its sales and production schedule -- which is common for start-ups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;As Fisker works through those issues and incorporates lessons learned from the production of the Karma, the department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat makes it an open question when the Delaware plant will produce Fisker autos. As of April, it only employed a small maintenance team. In the meantime, it&#39;s not getting loan money.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn ad from Americans for Prosperity starts with an image of Obama and says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as &quot;half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reality: Half a billion in loans from a Bush-era program were approved for Fisker Automotive. But they weren&rsquo;t tax credits, weren&rsquo;t part of the stimulus bill, and didn&rsquo;t go to Finland. And so far, the company has only gotten $190 million in those loans, far less than the half a billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead, the U.S. company spent a third of the money on U.S. engineering of a new electric vehicle. It chose to manufacture the car in Finland, without U.S. help. Another two-thirds of the loan, which it may or may not get, will go toward retooling a shuttered GM plant in Delaware. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad strings together disparate statements to tell a concocted story. The result is simply False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-02T17:40:51.141002", "ruling_date": "2012-05-03T11:11:33", "ruling_headline": "Ad says stimulus tax credits funded jobs in Finland", "ruling_headline_slug": "ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland", "ruling_link_text": "Not tax credits, not stimulus, not to Finland", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmericans for Prosperity, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lUQdP6y0ArM\">AFP Wasteful Spending Ad</a>,&quot;
