Garnet Coleman of Houston said it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the state&rsquo;s growing minority population.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom 2000 to 2010, &quot;close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas was non-Anglo, yet this map reduces the number of districts where communities of color can elect their candidate of choice,&quot; he said in an April 28 press release. That day, the GOP-dominant House approved the <a href=\"http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&amp;Bill=HB150\">revisions</a>, which Coleman says eliminates one district in which Hispanics make up the majority of registered voters, sending the plan to the Senate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not going to weigh in on whether the map disenfranchises voters. But we wondered whether he correctly pegged the state&rsquo;s non-Anglo population growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn April 2010, the Democratic Lone Star Project similarly said the state was expected to gain congressional seats &quot;almost entirely due to the growth of the African American and Hispanic populations in Texas in virtually every region of the state.&quot; We rated that <a href=\"http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/may/17/lone-star-project/democratic-group-credits-hispanic-and-african-amer/\">Mostly True</a>, finding that Hispanic growth seemed likely to deserve credit for Texas gaining seats, but that would be uncertain until the 2010 Census was complete.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne year later, it is. And responding to our request for evidence to support Coleman&rsquo;s &nbsp;claim, Joe Madden, Coleman&rsquo;s chief of staff, pointed us to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the 2010 Census, Texas grew 20.6 percent in the decade. It was the fifth fastest-growing state behind Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Idaho. By raw numbers alone, Texas&rsquo; population increased by about 4.3 million people. California, which retained the largest population, increased by 3.4 million. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow much of Texas&rsquo; population growth was due to non-Anglos?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to census data, in 2000, about 9.9 million minorities &mdash; people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic white &mdash; accounted for 47.6 percent of the state&rsquo;s population. From 2000 to 2010, the minority population swelled by 3.8 million, accounting for 54.7 percent of the population &mdash; and also making minorities responsible for about 89 percent of the state&rsquo;s growth through the decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a Feb. 18 Austin American-Statesman news <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/?tab=mo&amp;authuser=0#home\">article</a> analyzing the new census data, Latinos accounted for two-thirds of Texas&#39; growth over the decade and made up 37.6 percent of the state&#39;s total population through 2010, while blacks made up 11.5 percent of the growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert Bernstein, a Census Bureau spokesman, told us that Coleman was &quot;pretty much on the mark.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Coleman&rsquo;s statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-06T15:58:52.606593", "ruling_date": "2011-05-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Rep.
