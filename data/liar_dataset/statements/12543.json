It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate,&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the American Civil Liberties Union&#39;s website, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/map/non-discrimination-laws-state-state-information-map\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>22 states and the District of Columbia</u></a> prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity.
