Is that the case in Milwaukee?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Moore:</strong> Oh, absolutely, Lawrence. You know, we have one of the youngest African-American populations in the country. And the dearth of resources for summer jobs, for economic well being, for basic things like the ability to pay rent for women and the high incarceration rate for black males. We have the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country.

They also said both Milwaukee and Wisconsin have high rates of black male incarceration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they and University of Wisconsin-Madison sociology professor <a href=\"http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~oliver/\">Pamela Oliver</a>, &nbsp;whose research work includes the <a href=\"http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~oliver/racial-disparities/\">Wisconsin Racial Disparities Project</a>, told us there simply isn&rsquo;t city-level data nationally in order to rank Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oliver said it&rsquo;s likely Milwaukee would rank high among larger U.S. cities with large black populations, but that &quot;many members of the general public incorrectly assume that because 70 percent of Wisconsin&rsquo;s black people live in Milwaukee County that anything that is true about Wisconsin really refers to Milwaukee. It is more complicated than that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mauer noted that his organization, which works to address racial disparities, <a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/color-of-justice-racial-and-ethnic-disparity-in-state-prisons/\">reported in June 2016</a> that -- among black males and females -- Wisconsin has the second-highest rate of black incarceration in the nation, behind Oklahoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Unlike the UWM study, the Sentencing Project study didn&rsquo;t include local jails.
