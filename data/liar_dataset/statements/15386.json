Giuliani said that Trump had repaid Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to silence Daniels who alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the clickbait headline by The Political Voice could create the impression that Giuliani resigned from Trump&rsquo;s legal team, that&rsquo;s not the case. The story said that Giuliani resigned from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/10/giuliani-resigns-law-firm-579916\">Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence</a> from the firm&rsquo;s New York office in April and then in May resigned to focus on his work as one of Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyers on the Russia investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard A. Rosenbaum, executive chairman of Greenberg Traurig, confirmed in <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-giuliani-law-firm-20180510-story.html\">statements to the media </a>that Giuliani resigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After recognizing that this work is all-consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline said &quot;Official: Rudy Giuliani officially resigns, Trump&rsquo;s legal team on it&#39;s last leg.&quot; That headline creates the misleading and inaccurate impression that Giuliani quit Trump&rsquo;s legal team. In reality, he quit the Greenberg Traurig law firm to devote more time to his work for Trump.
