The answer is attached within the email, &quot;Is This Little Trayvon Martin.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere, Trayvon is bigger and stronger than the boy we&rsquo;ve seen in the hoodie. This Trayvon has facial hair. He&rsquo;s inked up from his hands to his neck. His right cheek bears a can&rsquo;t-miss tattoo -- a red star inset with &quot;LA,&quot; in the style of the Los Angeles Dodgers logo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe email accuses reporters of deceiving the public by suppressing this photo and publishing photos of a younger Trayvon after his death. Then it complains the media won&#39;t report the 17-year-old&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/26/2714778_p2/thousands-expected-at-trayvon.html\">disciplinary problems</a>. Actually, the <em><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/26/2714778/thousands-expected-at-trayvon.html\">Miami Herald </a></em>reported his suspensions and getting caught with marijuana and women&rsquo;s jewelry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email ends with a rant about the divisive, liberal agenda of the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They don&#39;t show the up-to-date pictures of&nbsp;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in the media,&quot; the email says. &quot;Now you know why.
