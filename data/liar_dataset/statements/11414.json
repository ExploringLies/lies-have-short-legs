They show Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center alleges Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. But Planned Parenthood says it has done nothing illegal and that the videos were edited in a misleading way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The videos led to the defunding effort. Earlier this month, we checked a claim by Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. Speaking on the House floor in favor of the defunding bill, Duffy said millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated his claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/08/sean-duffy/planned-parenthood-spends-millions-elect-democrats/\">Mostly True</a>.
