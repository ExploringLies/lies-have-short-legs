Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., spoke passionately about the impact it will have on women&rsquo;s health and especially on Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We all know by now that the recent CBO analysis has bad news for millions of Americans, but it has some especially bad news for women,&quot; Maloney said on the House floor on March 16, 2017, the same day that the House Budget Committee approved the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The GOP plan makes Planned Parenthood ineligible for any reimbursement from Medicaid or Medicare for one entire year,&quot; Maloney said. &quot;More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maloney was right that the bill restricts funds for Planned Parenthood. The American Health Care Act has a provision that won&rsquo;t allow states to use direct spending of federal funds on prohibited entities. &nbsp;Planned Parenthood is a prohibited entity under the bill because it is a provider that is &quot;primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health and related medical care&quot; or &quot;provides for abortion&quot; in any situation besides saving the life of the mother, incest or rape. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were intrigued, however, by the claim that half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or underserved areas. It&rsquo;s a tricky thing to measure, but the evidence suggests the claim is sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maloney&rsquo;s spokeswoman Jennifer Bell pointed us to data from Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics there show that <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/4314/8183/5009/20161207_Defunding_fs_d01_1.pdf\">54% </a>of Planned Parenthood facilities are located in health professional shortage areas, rural or medically underserved areas. &nbsp;This percentage was calculated by the <a href=\"https://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/tools/analyzers/geo/ShortageArea.aspx\">Health Resources &amp; Services Administration</a> Shortage Area Database system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HRSA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The HRSA&#39;s programs help provide health care to people who are geographically isolated, or economically or medically vulnerable. The agency identifies areas where health care is difficult to come by. &nbsp;Planned Parenthood matched up their locations to the HRSA data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"2017-03-23 14_51_21-Planned Parenthood in Underserved Communities.pdf - Adobe Reader.png\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2FaWPhgvREa4j6I8k-Zl8LFM5G0XKfQ4YNnmD-VanWrIREuknYf-9DbQXHkamtGdSD_-Hs4-_Uai4ENHBuGnTG2ub1AN-uNVK_Horo9Aiq1lhUDN8OEdpPT-Zlx2OAOzMWj4JMtu\" style=\"height:475px; width:575px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Holmes, an associate professor in health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, told us the government system of identifying underserved areas is reliable. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The HRSA database for shortage areas is pretty accurate. &nbsp;In terms of additional context, there are multiple types of shortage areas,&quot; he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holmes said some shortage areas are designated as a &quot;population&quot; shortage area. &nbsp;&quot;This area is okay in general, but for certain kinds of populations, they may have a tough time getting the care they need,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He used an example of &quot;low-income&quot; populations. &nbsp;&quot;Medicaid beneficiaries may live in an area with lots of providers, none of whom take Medicaid, so then although it looks like the area is well-served, there is actually a considerable shortage,&quot; Holmes said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s case, I don&rsquo;t think that is a problem because so many of Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s clients are lower income, according to their data.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ran this by two other health care experts, and they said that the claim was accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maloney said, &quot;More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That claim is supported by data from Planned Parenthood and the federal health care database. &nbsp;Experts familiar with the data told us that there is enough evidence to show Maloney was on target with her claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-23T16:59:47.255155", "ruling_date": "2017-03-24T11:45:45", "ruling_headline": "NY Rep.
