He wanted the statue &quot;permanently erected in the entryway of the White House,&quot; the article asserted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some versions included the image above, purportedly of the statue standing watch in the Oval Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, the article is contrived. We could find no credible mention of an Obama statue being put in or near the front door of the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source of this false account is a <a href=\"http://empirenews.net/obama-orders-life-sized-bronze-statute-of-himself-to-be-permanently-installed-in-white-house/\">Dec. 31, 2016, post</a> on EmpireNews.net. The website says it is &quot;intended for entertainment purposes only,&quot; and that its content <a href=\"http://empirenews.net/about-disclaimer/\">can&rsquo;t be reproduced without consent</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t hear back from the website when we asked whether permission had been granted to any other outlets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a real Obama statue, and it is actually bronze. But it&rsquo;s not anywhere in the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s along the &quot;avenue of heroes&quot; near Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Capitol building in San Juan, where the <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-puerto-ricos-resident-commissi-20160903-photo.html\">statue was installed in 2012</a>. Every president who has visited Puerto Rico gets a statue there; Obama took a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/06/14/obama.puerto.rico/\">trip to the commonwealth in 2011</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image currently on the original EmpireNews.net post is a photo from the Flickr account of a photographer named Paul Sableman, and is <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pasa/8369596644\">dated Jan. 8, 2013</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">It looks like hoaxsters combined the statue image with a photo of the Oval Office.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>But even the background is not the Oval Office. It&rsquo;s really a photo from the U.K.&rsquo;s Mirror of a replica created by <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/white-house-fan-builds-150000-2784482\">a Longview, Texas, man named Ron Wade</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wade reportedly spent $250,000 to build a facsimile of the Oval Office <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2012/03/president-obsessed-texan-ron-wade-has-an-oval-office-of-his-own-in-his-home/\">at 80 percent scale</a>. The composite doesn&rsquo;t even feature Obama&rsquo;s decor &mdash; the absence of his <a href=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/lets-acknowledge-the-most-underappreciated-member-of-th-1790627232\">chunky mica coffee table</a> was the giveaway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While EmpireNews.net labels itself a joke website in a disclaimer, there&rsquo;s no evidence of that in the faux story. That&rsquo;s doubly true when other sites then share the story. The addition of the composite image made from misappropriated photographs only heightens the deceit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve chiseled out the details to cast our own decision.
