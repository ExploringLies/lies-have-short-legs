Keith Ellison, D-Minn., called President Donald Trump&rsquo;s revised travel ban inhumane and cruel, and particularly hurtful to an immigrant community he knows well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In Minneapolis, we are proud of our Somalia-American community,&quot; Ellison said on MSNBC&rsquo;s <em>Morning Joe</em> on March 7. &quot;Somalia is going through a drought and a famine. They could be banned from getting relief through coming to the United States because of this ban.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Trump&rsquo;s latest <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">executive order</a>, refugee processing for people from six nations including Somalia is on hold for four months. The order caps the total number of refugees at 50,000 for the year, a cut of about half from what the Obama administration had planned. No new immigration visas will be issued for three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Ellison is right that Somalis can be banned from entering the country. But discussion of drought and famine is misplaced. Somalis can&#39;t apply for refugee status because of famine, said&nbsp;Mark Hetfield, president of the refugee assistance organization HIAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Before the ban, there was no U.S. immigration or refugee program which assists victims of humanitarian disasters like famine, so the ban itself will not hinder U.S. relief efforts,&quot; Hetfield said. &quot;The refugee program is only for individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group -- not a well founded fear of famine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kathleen Newland, a senior specialist&nbsp;on refugee issues at the Migration Policy Institute, agreed. Trump&#39;s travel ban does not affect a famine response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The U.S. response to famine in any location would not be to move people to the United States, but to help them where they are,&quot; Newland said. &quot;I can&rsquo;t see how the travel ban would affect relief efforts in and around Somalia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The head of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees Filippo Grandi criticized the travel ban in general terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are concerned that this decision, though temporary, may compound the anguish for those it affects,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2017/3/58bdd37e4/unhcr-underscores-humanitarian-imperative-refugees-new-rules-announced.html\">Grandi said</a> the day the latest executive order was signed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 15,000 Somalis live in refugee camps in Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Spiegel, a researcher at the Center for Refugee and Disaster Response at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said both war and drought have swelled the numbers at refugee camps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some of these refugees could be resettled to the United States and other countries,&quot; Spiegel said. &quot;Although a rather small amount compared to the number of people affected by the famine, every life counts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellison&rsquo;s spokesman Brett Morrow also noted that the United Nations estimates that about 6 million Somalis need food aid. The freeze on visa and refugee processing blocks people from getting out, which puts additional strain on already stretched humanitarian efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellison said that people threatened by famine in Somalia could be banned from getting relief through coming to the United States due to Trump administration visa and refugee restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with this claim is that the famine has little to no bearing on Somali refugee status.&nbsp;Somalis can&#39;t apply for refugee status because of famine or drought, experts say.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellison&#39;s statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-08T16:45:04.920542", "ruling_date": "2017-03-13T15:31:46", "ruling_headline": "Ellison says travel ban will hurt Somalis fleeing famine", "ruling_headline_slug": "ellison-says-travel-ban-will-hurt-somalis-fleeing-", "ruling_link_text": "Refugee program doesn't apply", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>MSNBC, <em><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/trump-immigration-list-both-irrational-and-mean-ellison-891983939586\">Morning Joe</a></em>, March 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states\">Executive Order Protecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States</a>, March 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Migration Policy Institute, <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/revised-trump-travel-ban-who-might-be-affected-six-targeted-countries\">The Revised Trump Travel Ban: Who Might Be Affected from the Six Targeted Countries?</a>, March 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations High Commission for Refugees,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2017/3/58bdd37e4/unhcr-underscores-humanitarian-imperative-refugees-new-rules-announced.html\">UNHCR underscores humanitarian imperative for refugees as new U.S. rules announced</a>, March 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Brett Morrow, communications director, Office of Rep.
