They have been &quot;enticed&rsquo; to take on large debt because subsidies limit interest rates on student loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The availability of loans and grants has led to increases in the cost of higher education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And so we have, in all of our good intentions,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;we&rsquo;ve actually made college less accessible because we&rsquo;ve made it so unaffordable and we&rsquo;ve plunged our children into debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he made this claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And also by giving them this easy debt, on average, kids are taking six years to get a four-year degree, while that debt meter is increasing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the start of school right around the corner, we wondered whether it&#39;s really taking an average of six years to get from high school diploma to bachelor&#39;s degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Getting our bearings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s staff didn&rsquo;t follow through on a promise to send us evidence to back his claim. But let&rsquo;s note a couple of things for we evaluate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson spoke of &quot;kids.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s fair to say his six-year claim applies to students who start college shortly after finishing high school, rather than adults who pursue a degree later in life, perhaps over many years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also used the phrase &quot;on average.&quot; That number, of course, is stretched by students who don&rsquo;t take just four or six years, but much longer to finish their degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means there&rsquo;s some value in also looking at how long it takes for a typical student to get a B.A. or B.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Averages</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We examined the latest U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013150.pdf\"><u>statistics</u></a> that include averages in measuring the time it takes to get a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. We also discussed them with department statistician Aurora D&rsquo;Amico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those statistics, which cover students who earned their first four-year degree during the 2007-2008 school year, cast a pretty wide net. They include part-time as well as full-time students; students who started their college studies at a two-year or a four-year institution; and students who were not seeking a degree of any type when they initially entered college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that relatively broad collection of students, the average time to get their bachelor&rsquo;s degree was six years and four months -- even higher than what Johnson claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time was shorter -- five years and 10 months -- for students who began college within a year of finishing high school; those are arguably the &quot;kids&quot; Johnson was referring to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for students who started their college studies at a four-year institution, rather than a two-year school, the average was five years and eight months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, those are the averages, all of which are in the ballpark of Johnson&rsquo;s six-year claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other measures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Education study also provided figures that aren&rsquo;t averages, notably this one: 44 percent of the students who got their degrees in 2007-2008 did so within four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That compares to 23 percent who needed five or six years (and 33 percent who took more than six years).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it is more common to earn a four-year degree in four years than it is in five to six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another recent Department of Education <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_376.asp\"><u>study</u></a>, reviewing a narrower group of students, found similar results. It covered first-time, full-time students who entered four-year institution in fall 2005 aiming to obtain a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this group, 39 percent got their four-year degree within four years; 59 percent graduated within six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson said that on average, college students &quot;are taking six years to get a four-year degree.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s more common for students to take four years to graduate than it is for them to take six years. But overall, the average duration is about six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs additional information. That&rsquo;s how we rate this one.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-06T17:05:26.033433", "ruling_date": "2013-08-11T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "On average, a college degree takes six years, U.S. Sen.
