John Kitzhaber</a> signed <a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2013/SB833/\">Senate Bill 833</a> on May 1, 2013, a group opposing the measure mapped plans to gather enough signatures to refer it to voters. <a href=\"http://www.protectoregondl.org/\">Protect Oregon Driver Licenses</a>&rsquo; effort succeeded, and state voters will decide on Ballot Measure 88 in November. A yes vote would allow the law, whose implementation was suspended by the referendum effort, to take effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The claim:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Group members remain unhappy with the process, saying they were denied chances to participate in a 15-member work group convened by the governor before the original legislation was drafted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among statements on Protect Oregon Driver Licenses&rsquo; website is this claim: Gov. John Kitzhaber formed a group to create SB 833 &quot;behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/\">PolitiFact Oregon</a> checked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The analysis:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We called Jim Ludwick, communications director for <a href=\"http://www.oregonir.org/\">Oregonians for Immigration Reform</a> -- the parent group of Protect Oregon Driver Licenses. Although the claim was made more than a year ago in April 2013, Ludwick said the group stands by it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told us group members, hearing that the governor wanted a &quot;special work force to draft legislation&quot; to authorize driver cards, repeatedly asked the governor&rsquo;s staff how they could take part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We wanted a place at the table,&quot; Ludwick said. &quot;We felt we should have a right to debate the issue.&quot; Only later, he said, did he and others learn a work group had already been appointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The whole thing was cooked and baked behind closed doors,&quot; Ludwick said. &quot;We were strung along and excluded at every step.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislative records show that four Democrats and four Republicans served as the bill&rsquo;s primary sponsors. We emailed their offices for their take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/legislators/Chris-Harker/\">Rep. Chris Harker, D-Beaverton</a>, noted apparent confusion between the work group&rsquo;s role and the actual drafting of the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kitzhaber convened the 15-member work group, Harker said, to make policy recommendations around an Oregon driver card. Those recommendations, he said, were combined with information provided by <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/Pages/index.aspx\">Driver and Motor Vehicles Services</a> and a bipartisan group of legislators to &quot;inform the drafting of Senate Bill 833.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill itself sailed through through two &quot;very well attended public hearings,&quot; Harker said. He added that it was significantly amended once and had &quot;input from more than 20 legislators.&quot; Harker said that the first hearing, held April 11, 2013, drew &quot;so many participants they had to open three overflow rooms; hardly what I would call &lsquo;behind closed doors.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of Ludwick&rsquo;s group, according to legislative records, were among those testifying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/legislators/Vic-Gilliam/\">Rep. Vic Gilliam</a>, a Republican from Silverton, was even more vociferous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The unfounded protestations by this group and other similar groups has, for me, moved from disappointing to disgusting,&quot; he wrote in an email. &quot;Claims that a bill moved through the Legislature, with committee and floor-sessions in both chambers, seems hardly to have been fashioned behind closed doors, without allowing any citizen input.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office of another co-sponsor, state <a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/legislators/Chip-Shields/\">Sen. Chip Shields, D-Portland</a>, said opponents shouldn&rsquo;t have been caught off-guard by the 2013 effort since Shields introduced &quot;a very similar bill&quot; the prior session, in 2011. That bill, SB 845, died in committee but not before a public hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then emailed the governor&rsquo;s office, asking who participated in the work group and whether that process proceeded in accordance with Oregon&rsquo;s public meetings law requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spokeswoman Rachel Wray provided the list of participants, who represented a variety of public and private interests -- four current and retired chiefs of police; members of four Latino-affairs and advocacy organizations; a labor union representative; dairy, nursery, restaurant and winegrower representatives; someone from Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon; and a member of the governor&rsquo;s staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We consulted state statutes, which give the governor a green light to convene such groups, so long as they make only recommendations for his consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ruling:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2013 Oregon Legislature, in a bipartisan effort, approved a bill providing driver cards to those unable to prove they are in the country legally. After the governor signed the bill, a group opposing it quickly gathered enough signatures to refer SB 833 to the November ballot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, members of the group, Protect Oregon Driver Licenses, claim they were shut out of a 15-member work group that made recommendations for how the bill should be drafted, and that the effort was fashioned &quot;behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work group, in accordance with Oregon public meeting law, met privately, giving some credence to the opponents&rsquo; claim of meeting &quot;behind closed doors.&quot; While the work group did not include those who opposed the effort outright, it did include a wide spectrum of views, from chiefs of police to industries and individuals potentially affected by the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the bill that ultimately passed, after two well-attended public sessions, went through at least one significant amendment and other tweaks. Dozens of people, including the opposition, testified before the bill&rsquo;s eventual passage, making it hard to argue that, as an opposition spokesman asserted, everything was &quot;cooked and baked behind closed doors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thoughts on this ruling?
