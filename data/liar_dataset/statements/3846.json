John Tassoni Jr. is waging an aggressive campaign to oust the leadership of the embattled Central Falls school system<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/News/pr1.asp?prid=7337\">news release</a>, he called for the immediate resignation of Supt. Frances Gallo, saying that management of the state-funded district is &quot;erratic at best and incompetent at worst. &hellip; State money is being used to operate the schools, and some of that money is being wasted and used irresponsibly.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not about to wade into a controversy over who should be leading the school system. Gallo and the schools have made national news for reform efforts that have kept administrators and the teachers locked in a nasty fray for more than a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we were curious about one example Tassoni gave of questionable financial decisions. In his press release, he stated that &quot;he has learned that the department spent $100,000 on a time clock.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReally? Could a time clock cost that much?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithout punching in, we got right to work on this one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we met with Tassoni, he showed us three Central Falls school district documents that he &nbsp;called &quot;purchase orders.&quot; He noted that each made reference to a time clock and that each had a different total: $40,543.64, $55,414.68 and $5,581.68.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo he added them up. Grand total: $101,540.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That $100,000 disturbed me -- $100,000 for a time clock?&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA first glance at the documents, however, reveals that there&rsquo;s a great deal more to the purchase than a &quot;time clock.&quot; Two of the documents specify the order was for &nbsp;&quot;TimeClock Plus 6.0 Professional.&quot; There&rsquo;s enough detail to make clear it&rsquo;s a computerized system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s not just a clock. It&rsquo;s a whole system,&quot; Gallo said when we contacted her. &quot;It&rsquo;s automated and has brought us out of antiquity into a truly networked system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe pictured Fred Flintstone <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJuk81wv5uM\">ending his day at Slate Rock and Gravel Company b</a>y simply &nbsp;sticking his time card into a dinosaur&rsquo;s mouth. And we recalled those classic wall-mounted clocks, the kind Moocher, in the movie &quot;Breaking Away,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7qeSPFH3gg\">smashes with his fist</a> when his boss &nbsp;says, &nbsp;&quot;Don&rsquo;t forget to punch the clock, Shorty.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat can the new system do better? And how does it work?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo one sticks a card into a clock in Central Falls schools anymore. Hourly employees place a finger on a scanner to record their arrival and departure. Their fingerprints are checked to verify their identity. Forget punching in for a friend who hasn&rsquo;t shown up for work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe clocks relay employees&rsquo; hours to payroll systems, reducing the time staff must spend processing cards and avoiding human error that could result in payment mistakes, according to Giovanna Venditti, the School Department&rsquo;s director of finance, and Kathy Gaouette, director of human resources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe system can notify administrators when employees are approaching overtime. TimeClock can also ease record-keeping by tracking which hours should be paid out of the general fund or from an account set up for a specific grant, they said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the 500 full- and part-time employees who support the 2,800-student district, only 182 mostly non-salaried employees -- including maintenance workers, crossing guards, bus monitors and drivers -- use the new system. But the district wants its 340 teachers to agree to use it, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow back to those documents that Tassoni used to support his $100,000 claim. Only two are actual purchase orders, said Venditti.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne for $55,598.68, dated March 15, 2010, was for hardware, software, licensing fees, training and systems support. The purchase included 11 time clocks -- not one -- for nine school buildings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other purchase order, for $5,581, dated Feb. 23, 2011, was to renew a technical support agreement &nbsp;for the TimeClock system for another year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that third document, the one with the $40,539 total? It&rsquo;s just a packing slip. Unlike the other two documents, it does not say &quot;purchase order&quot; at the top in large bold letters or include any similar information, such as a &nbsp;&quot;P.O. date&quot; or &quot;P.O. issued to.&quot; &nbsp;Data Management Inc., of San Angelo, Texas, simply included it in a shipment of items it sent to Central Falls. The packing slip didn&rsquo;t total $55,598, the amount of the purchase order, because the $13,442 fingerprint scanning equipment and one other item were shipped separately.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Tassoni, by simply adding the totals of the three documents, counted some items twice, inflating the original purchase of $55,598.68 (excluding the systems support renewal) by nearly 75 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It is not $100,000,&quot; said Venditti, &nbsp;the finance director.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTimeClock was recommended by UniFund, the New Hampshire company that sold Central Falls its BudgetSense financial software, which helps the schools meet state financial reporting requirements. The programs are compatible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike Central Falls, Barrington purchased TimeClock at the advice of UniFund. The town paid only $18,996, said Ronald Tarro, director of administration and finance -- a lot less than Central. Falls. But Barrington bought two fewer clocks and decided not to pay extra for the fingerprint technology. Barrington schools use badges instead.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrington&rsquo;s costs are also substantially lower because only 25 non-salaried maintenance and custodial staff are using TimeClock. Data Management charges a fee based on the number of users--$15 for each of the 500 employees that Central Falls wants to use the clocks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith the clock still running, where does this leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor starters, Tassoni could have asked school officials about the documents he was shown. Instead, the senator -- who publishes a union newspaper and is a former union administrator -- simply added up the totals on the three documents to push his case against the school leadership. That&rsquo;s flimsy backup for saying he &quot;learned&quot; of a $100,000 expenditure and, then, choosing two words out of context, calling the purchase a &quot;time clock.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt clearly was not just a time clock. And it didn&rsquo;t cost $100,000. The total was just over half that (plus the annual support contracts which are typical of software purchases).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen he turned over the documents to PolitiFact, Tassoni even admitted, &quot;I could be all wet.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe IS all wet. But not to worry. We&rsquo;re going to flame-dry his Dockers with a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Pants on Fire</a>!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
