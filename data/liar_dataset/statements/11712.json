Terry McAuliffe&rsquo;s spiel to talk about how he &quot;inherited a $2.4 billion deficit&quot; when he took office in January 2014 and managed, with the bipartisan help of legislators, to balance the state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent PolitiFact, we checked McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim that the shortfall was left behind by his predecessor, Republican Bob McDonnell. We noted that McDonnell proposed a balanced budget before leaving office and records show that the brunt of the economic slowdown that caused the shortfall, although not McAuliffe&rsquo;s fault, occurred during his watch. We rated that claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor added a <a href=\"http://1140wrva.iheart.com/media/play/26573601/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>new element</u></a> to the claim on Dec. 10 during his monthly radio show on WRVA in Richmond. &quot;I came in with a record deficit I inherited,&quot; said McAuliffe, a Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without rehashing details of the &quot;inherited&quot; part of his statement, we decided to examine McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim that the $2.4 billion shortfall he confronted was &quot;a record deficit&quot; for Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Records show the state faced a far greater crisis at the start of 2010, when McDonnell was succeeding Democrat Tim Kaine as governor and Virginia began suffering the full effects of the Great Recession. <a href=\"http://hac.virginia.gov/documents/2010/2010_documents.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Two reports</u></a> by the General Assembly&rsquo;s budget committees at that time identified a shortfall of almost $4.5 billion for the two-year budget that would begin July 1, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Coy, McAuliffe&rsquo;s director of communications, told us the governor &quot;misspoke&quot; in claiming he faced a deficit record. The reason for the mistake requires a little explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe, as we noted in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/nov/16/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-he-inherited-large-defict-and-turne/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nov. 16 fact check</u></a>, typically follows his claim about inheriting a $2.4 billion deficit with the kicker that he and lawmakers adroitly turned the problem &quot;into a record surplus.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He offered the same kicker on WRVA, noting that the so-called &quot;record deficit&quot; is &quot;now a record surplus.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coy said McAuliffe inadvertently used the adjective &quot;record&quot; to describe both budget developments instead of just the surplus. &quot;When you talk to the public all day, sometimes you have a slip of the tongue,&quot; Coy said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know of no other instance where the governor made a similar claim about the shortfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The record surplus stems from McAuliffe&rsquo;s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. That slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year ending in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990. But it should be added that when adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people seeing all these figures might conclude that Virginia&rsquo;s budget has made an almost $3 billion rebound during the past year -- from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus this year. As we&rsquo;ve noted before, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe and the legislature overestimated the state&rsquo;s economic problems in August 2014, when they adjusted the two-year budget to a &quot;pessimistic&quot; forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe now cites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe said the $2.4 billion budget shortfall he and lawmakers resolved last year was &quot;a record deficit&quot; for Virginia. When we questioned about the assertion, a spokesman said the governor misspoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the reddest ink in Virginia was seen in 2010, when the state, in the teeth of recession, faced a $4.5 billion shortfall for the coming two-year budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t suggest the crisis McAuliffe faced was peanuts or question the explanation that he made a simple &quot;slip of the tongue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But words matter, and we rate McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-12-21T08:45:06.664694", "ruling_date": "2015-12-21T08:38:10", "ruling_headline": "McAuliffe's 'misspoken' claim about facing record deficit", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcauliffes-misspoken-claim-about-facing-record-def", "ruling_link_text": "\"Slip of the tongue\" ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Terry McAuliffe, <a href=\"http://1140wrva.iheart.com/media/play/26573601/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>comments on WRVA&rsquo;s &quot;Ask the Governor</u></a>, Dec. 10, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/nov/16/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-he-inherited-large-defict-and-turne/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>McAuliffe says he &lsquo;inherited large deficit&rsquo; and turned it into a surplus</u></a>,&quot; Nov. 16, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, &quot;<a href=\"http://hac.virginia.gov/documents/2010/2010_documents.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Summary of Governor&rsquo;s Proposed 2010-2012 Budget</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 11, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees, &quot;<a href=\"http://hac.virginia.gov/documents/2010/2010_documents.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Summary of Budget Actions</u></a>,&quot; June 29, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Brian McCoy, director of communications for McAuliffe, Dec. 17, 2015.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Terry", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 1189, "last_name": "McAuliffe", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "terry-mcauliffe", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mcauliffe1.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1189/", "total_count": 34, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.terrymcauliffe.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says he faced &quot;a record budget deficit&quot; in Virginia in 2014.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio interview.", "statement_date": "2015-12-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
