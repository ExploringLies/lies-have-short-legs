Committee paints an already dim picture of the system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mailer notes reduced hours and compares them to other metro-area counties: &quot;Right now, our libraries are open 44 hours per week, down from 57 hours just a few years ago. That&rsquo;s the lowest of any library in the four-county region.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon was well aware that the system has cut back in certain areas, but it surprised us that the cuts had gone so far as to put operating hours behind Clackamas, Washington and Clark counties. We thought a quick check was warranted -- and quick it was.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked the website for each of the counties&rsquo; libraries and calculated the weekly operating hours for the main branches. Here&rsquo;s what we found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Multnomah County, the Central Library is open <a href=\"http://www.multcolib.org/hours/\">44 hours each week</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Washington County, the Hillsboro Main Library is open <a href=\"http://www.wccls.org/libraries/hillsboro\">64 hours each </a><a href=\"http://www.wccls.org/libraries/hillsboro\">week</a>and the Beaverton City Library is open <a href=\"http://www.wccls.org/libraries/beaverton\">63 hours</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Clackamas County, the library system is open <a href=\"http://www.clackamas.us/lib/hours.html\">52 hours a week</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd up in Washington&rsquo;s Clark County, the main Vancouver Community Library is open <a href=\"http://www.fvrl.org/aboutus/branch_list.cfm\">60 hours a week</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe &nbsp;also called the group responsible for the mailer and asked them about the statement. They sent us a slightly different group of numbers -- the average number of hours a library was open in each county. Their findings supported the same conclusion: Multnomah County library hours are the lowest in the four-county region.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find this statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-26T18:42:23.816642", "ruling_date": "2012-10-26T15:40:46", "ruling_headline": "Are the Multnomah County Library's hours the shortest in the area?
