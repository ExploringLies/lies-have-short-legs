Dan Patrick said Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst owes more than $1 million to creditors from his losing 2012 run for the U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst and Patrick, both of Houston, are in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination after Patrick led the four-way March primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/218654183/WP-DHD-Ad-Mother-of-All-Debts-Factcheck\"><u>document</u></a> posted online after Dewhurst&rsquo;s ad debuted April 16, 2014, Patrick&rsquo;s campaign mentioned a one-time Dewhurst business debt. &quot;In addition to these debts,&quot; Patrick said, Dewhurst &quot;currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick&rsquo;s camp provided web links to news stories as the basis of the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Aug. 13, 2013, the Texas Tribune <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2013/08/13/dewhurst-campaign-owes-vendors-nearly-1-million/\"><u>reported that</u></a> through June 2013, Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign finance reports indicated that it still owed $909,875.90 to consultants and vendors involved in his Senate bid. In July 2012, Dewhurst lost a primary runoff to attorney Ted Cruz, who won the seat that November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The unpaid bills range from several six-figure debts to media experts to a few hundred dollars owed to a company that provided email services,&quot; the Tribune story said. &quot;Many of the vendors are upset about getting stiffed for thousands of dollars from the campaign of a multi-millionaire candidate like Dewhurst, who hasn&rsquo;t hesitated to pour some of his vast wealth into his political endeavors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then-Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed out that Dewhurst was still legally entangled in pursuing the recovery of up to $2 million allegedly stolen from his state and federal campaign kitties by a former campaign manager, Kenneth &quot;Buddy&quot; Barfield, the story said. Considine said lawsuits filed by Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign committees included an effort to recover funds &quot;that should have been used to pay any outstanding federal campaign obligations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Debts from Dewhurst&rsquo;s 2012 campaign subsequently increased, according to a <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140207-david-dewhursts-2012-campaign-still-owes-vendors-more-than-1-million.ece\"><u>news story</u></a> in the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> posted online Feb. 7, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst, the story said, &quot;still owes businesses $1.4 million from his failed 2012 U.S. Senate campaign, a federal report filed this week shows. The 20 private creditors have been waiting 18 months for payment. The debt ranges from $170,628 to a Maryland-based media consultant to $464 for email services.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story quoted Considine, on Dewhurst&rsquo;s behalf, as blaming the Barfield morass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to the Federal Election Commission website and perused the <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/066/14020131066/14020131066.pdf\"><u>Dewhurst finance report</u></a> that was cited in the <em>News</em> story. The report, filed by Dewhurst&rsquo;s Senate committee in February 2014, indicates outstanding debts of $1,406,808 as of the end of 2013, not counting loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Dewhurst&rsquo;s lieutenant governor campaign about Patrick&rsquo;s claim. By email, spokeswoman Eliza Vielma pointed out the outstanding debts belong to Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign, not to Dewhurst personally. Also, she said, efforts continue to sell Barfield&rsquo;s former home to raise money that would make up for the funds &quot;stolen by Barfield from&quot; Dewhurst&rsquo;s state and federal campaign &quot;committees,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a Jan. 3, 2014, <em>Houston Chronicle</em> <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2014/01/dewhurst-gets-home-of-consultant-accused-of-theft/\"><u>news story</u></a>, Dewhurst in November 2013 reached a settlement agreement with Barfield agreeing to sign over his West Austin home to repay a portion of the campaign funds that Dewhurst has said Barfield stole. On April 18, 2014, a <a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1606-Watchhill-Rd-Austin-TX-78703/29331962_zpid/\"><u>Zillow.com web page </u></a>showed the home in the Old Enfield part of Austin for sale for $2.75 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a <em>Chronicle</em> <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Dewhurst-linked-scandal-takes-a-Houston-twist-5135213.php\"><u>news story</u></a> posted online Jan. 11, 2014, a Dewhurst Senate campaign attorney, Adam Schramek, said after Dewhurst&rsquo;s settlement with Barfield came public: &quot;This matter is being handled by the Travis County District Attorney&#39;s office, but my clients are pursuing every avenue to achieve full restitution for Mr. Barfield&#39;s crimes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick said Dewhurst &quot;currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be precise, it&#39;s Dewhurst&#39;s Senate campaign that had outstanding debts exceeding $1.4 million through 2013. Also, Dewhurst appears to be trying to recoup campaign dollars he has described as stolen; it&rsquo;s not as if he&rsquo;s simply a deadbeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim, which lacked this additional information, as Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash;
