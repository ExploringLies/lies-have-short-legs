Paul Ryan, R-Wis., saying it reflected the principles of the Koch brothers and would lower taxes on the wealthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is $80 billion of personal wealth for the Koch brothers enough?&quot; Reid asked. &quot;I think most everyone would say yes, it&#39;s enough. But not the Koch brothers. They want more. They&#39;re the richest people in the world. Individually they&#39;re only fifth. Put them together they&#39;re the richest in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered: Is that correct? Reid&rsquo;s office didn&rsquo;t respond to an inquiry for this story, but we were able to find some answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s tricky to say definitively who is richer than who, because of privacy issues and fluctuations in market values. But the longstanding yardstick for measuring the world&rsquo;s richest people comes from <em>Forbes </em>magazine, which publishes both the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/list/\"><u>Forbes 400</u></a> (a list of the 400 richest Americans) and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/#tab:overall\"><u>the World&rsquo;s Billionaires</u></a> (which tracks more than 1,600 billionaires across the globe).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Charles and David Koch, when measured as individuals, are tied for sixth place on the international list, with $40.7 billion each. Combined, their net worth is $81.4 billion, which is higher than the highest-ranking individual on the list -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates, at $77.8 billion. (A third brother, William, has long been estranged from Charles and David, and media accounts about the brothers&rsquo; giving patterns generally do not consider him to be part of the &quot;Koch brothers.&quot; William is worth an additional $4 billion.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So are Charles and David Koch No. 1 in the world? They&rsquo;re close--but not quite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reid ignored one other family that, collectively, has greater net worth than the Kochs: the Waltons, the heirs to the Walmart fortune. Here&rsquo;s the rundown, in descending order of their ranking on the Forbes international list:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Christy Walton and family: $38 billion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Jim Walton: $35.6 billion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Alice Walton: $35.1 billion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. S. Robson Walton: $35.1 billion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>305. Ann Walton Kroenke: $5.0 billion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>367. Nancy Walton Laurie: $4.2 billion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, the six Waltons have a net worth of $153 billion -- a little less than double the holdings of Charles and David Koch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if Reid is going to put together the Koch brothers, it makes sense to combine the wealth of the Walton family as well. And the Walton family&rsquo;s wealth is bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reid said the Koch brothers are &quot;the richest people in the world. Individually they&#39;re only fifth. Put them together they&#39;re the richest in the world.&quot; If you look at families -- which is what Reid is essentially doing -- then Charles and David Koch rank second internationally to six members of the Walton family, at least according to <em>Forbes</em>. That&rsquo;s still pretty close to the top of the list. We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-02T14:06:19.899509", "ruling_date": "2014-04-02T14:32:19", "ruling_headline": "Harry Reid says Koch brothers are richest family in the world", "ruling_headline_slug": "harry-reid-says-koch-brothers-are-richest-family-w", "ruling_link_text": "They're second, to the Waltons", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Harry Reid, <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4488758/sen-reid-ryan-koch-budget\"><u>Senate floor speech</u></a>, April 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Forbes</em>, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\"><u>the World&rsquo;s Billionaires</u></a>, accessed April 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Forbes</em>, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/list/\"><u>the Forbes 400</u></a>, September 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Village Voice</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-08-24/news/william-bill-koch-the-other-koch-brother-tea-party/\"><u>The Other Koch Brother: In the shadow of his brothers&#39; Tea Party fame, Bill Koch seems almost like a normal billionaire</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 24 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-s/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/\"><u>Bernie Sanders says Walmart heirs own more wealth than bottom 40 percent of Americans</u></a>,&quot; July 31, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Senate Democratic Leader", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Harry", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Nevada", "id": 116, "last_name": "Reid", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "harry-reid", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-harryreid.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/116/", "total_count": 28, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://reid.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>The Koch brothers are &quot;the richest people in the world.
