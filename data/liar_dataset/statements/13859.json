David Simmons, R-Longwood, to establish a memory disorder clinic at Florida Hospital in Orange County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laird&rsquo;s office did not return a call, but we were able to find statistics that closely matched what she told the committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were cited in &quot;<a href=\"http://www.alz.org/documents_custom/2017-facts-and-figures.pdf\">2017 Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Facts and Figures</a>,&quot; a report by the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, the leading advocacy group for patients with the severe memory-loss condition and their families and caregivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report, in Table 4, offers projections for state-by-state numbers of residents with Alzheimer&rsquo;s in 2017 and 2025. For Florida, it lists 520,000 people with the disease in 2017 and 720,000 for 2025, a growth rate of 38.5 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rounded off, those are essentially identical to the figures Laird cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the table cites these figures as &quot;estimates&quot; (for 2017) and &quot;projected&quot; (for 2025).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers in the report are footnoted to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719424/\">study</a> published in the academic journal <em>Neurology </em>in May 2013. The authors used Alzheimer&rsquo;s diagnosis statistics from 2010 to create estimates of how many cases would be expected in future years as far out as 2050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the margins of error in estimates and projections, and given the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in patients, it&rsquo;s a slight overreach for Laird to frame these as hard numbers of Floridians who have the disease today. They are a useful yardstick and were published in a respected scientific journal, but her phrasing suggests too high a degree of certainty about the numbers who have the disease today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is accurate to say that the numbers are estimates, or as we put it in the report, &lsquo;projections,&rsquo; &quot; said Laura Cilmi, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laird said, &quot;Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These numbers are sourced to a credible scientific paper, though it&rsquo;s worth noting that the paper deals in estimates and projections, rather than hard, verifiable numbers.
