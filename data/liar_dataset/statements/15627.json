The Railroad Commission of Texas has nothing to do with railroads. This would be like calling the Food and... Drug Administration the Department of Transportation. This is about basic transparency,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAllen, the 2018 Democratic nominee for a seat on the commission, faces the Republican incumbent, <a href=\"https://www.christicraddick.com/\">Christi Craddick</a>, on the November 2018 ballot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s widely known the commission <a href=\"https://hro.house.texas.gov/pdf/ba85r/hb1818.pdf#navpanes=0\">regulates</a> oil and gas drilling and production, well plugging and site remediation, pipeline safety and damage prevention, surface mining of coal and uranium, gas utility rates and alternative fuels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, was McAllen right that the commission--steered by three elected members, each one having a six-year term--has nothing to do with railroads?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commission says so on a web page titled <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/about-us/resource-center/faqs/who-regulates-railroads-in-texas/\">&quot;Who Regulates Railroads in Texas?&quot;</a> That page says the commission &quot;no longer has any jurisdiction or authority over railroads.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the agency started with a vigorous rail focus. In 1890, James Stephen Hogg won election as governor while calling for a constitutional amendment authorizing lawmakers to start a commission to bird-dog customer-gouging out-of-state railroad companies, according to a 1905 book compiling Hogg&rsquo;s papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hogg devoted 6,000 words of his April 1890 campaign kickoff speech to making the case for a commission to regulate rates and traffic on the state&rsquo;s rail lines. His slogan: &quot;Hogg and The Commission.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hogg said in his speech: &quot;The issue so sharply drawn in the present campaign is, shall corporate power or the State control? The fight is on and the issue is unmistakably presented.&quot; The law creating the commission took effect in June 1891.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its infancy, the commission regulated in-state railroad rates including passenger fares, according to a commission web page titled <a href=\"http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/about-us/history/informal-history-toc/railroads-in-the-rrc/\">&quot;The &#39;Railroads&#39; in the Railroad Commission.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When the commission was founded in 1891, there were some 8,700 miles of track&quot; in the state, the page says. &quot;When the railroads reached their peak in Texas in 1930, there were 17,500 miles.&quot; But following World War II, goods increasingly &quot;began to travel by truck and people by buses and cars and the miles of track began to shrink,&quot; the page says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meantime, oil and gas regulation proved paramount. In a 1981 book on the commission, David Prindle of the University of Texas said that a few years after the <a href=\"http://buzzworthy.blog.austin360.com/2017/01/10/116-years-ago-today-spindletop-changed-course-of-texas-history/\">Spindletop oil well gushed</a> in 1901--birthing&nbsp;the economy&rsquo;s dominant oil sector--the commission landed responsibility for regulating oil and gas pipelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prindle&rsquo;s book calls the commission&rsquo;s subsequent actions dealing with railroads &quot;of only limited interest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes in federal law later vested rail safety in a federal agency (1970) and left states with no guiding role in rail rate-setting (1980), the commission&rsquo;s &quot;railroads&quot; web page says. In 2005, finally, legislators transferred remaining rail safety oversight to the Texas Department of Transportation, &quot;leaving the commission with no regulatory authority related to any aspect of the rail industry,&quot; the agency says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Name-change moves stall</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAllen is hardly the first person to say the agency&rsquo;s name should reflect its revised duties. But promoters of a change failed to persuade the 2017 Legislature to act and previous efforts to swap in an energy-oriented name faltered in 2005, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, according to a 2016 news account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&nbsp;<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"https://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/should-the-texas-railroad-commission-get-new-name/t9UqhaRY3UgURSwAJ7AXeP/\">news story</a> quoted Rep.

Craddick&rsquo;s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.christicraddick.com/\">Christi Craddick</a>, who seeks re-election against McAllen, said then that changing the name wasn&rsquo;t her priority when it&rsquo;d cost money needed for other needs--a position she reaffirmed in a statement emailed to us by an aide, Lauren Spreen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAllen said the railroad commission has nothing to do with railroads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It did, for more than a century.
