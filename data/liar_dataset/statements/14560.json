The federal government could withhold money granted to a state under a waiver if the state doesn&rsquo;t do as it promised, but the words &quot;adequate&quot; and &quot;affordable&quot; are open to interpretation.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Policies would not have to provide the same level of coverage now mandated under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Estimates say about 34 states would see net funding cuts under the bill. It costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&#39;s&nbsp;claim goes further than Trump&rsquo;s, saying the bill&rsquo;s pre-existing protections are as good as Obamacare&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in reviewing the GOP bill, the political news website <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/sp/about/#our-mission\">Axios</a> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/what-graham-cassidy-really-means-for-pre-existing-conditions-2487720743.html\">arrived at similar findings</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The funding cuts &quot;could pressure states to waive protections for sick people as a way to keep premium increases in check. Older, sicker people in every state could end up paying more as states try to make up for a funding shortfall.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>States could get a waiver to let insurers charge sick people more than healthy people.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A waiver would exempt insurers from the current requirement to provide &quot;essential health benefits,&quot; including prescription drugs -- so, people who need expensive drugs might have to pay out of pocket.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And Pollitz told us that states could also allow insurance companies to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Charge lower premiums to people while they&rsquo;re healthy, but then raise the rates at renewal time if, for example, they get cancer.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Charge higher premiums based on a person&rsquo;s location or occupation, practices that are outlawed under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=DC1FC472-3D15-4948-BB29-548F13ADA9C0\">Information</a> from the bill&rsquo;s sponsors say it would protect people with pre-existing conditions, but doesn&rsquo;t provide details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick McIlheran, a Johnson spokesman, told us the bill gives states the flexibility to try &quot;new approaches to keeping insurance for those with pre-existing conditions affordable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we close, it&rsquo;s worth noting:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/451512/republican-health-care-bill-compromise\">Writing about the bill</a> in the conservative National Review, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, made one reference to pre-existing conditions, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>On the positive side, supporters of the legislation correctly point out that it would give the states far more flexibility with the funds they receive, and would allow them to waive many of Obamacare&rsquo;s more onerous regulations, including the mandate to buy coverage, mandated benefits and pre-existing-condition coverage requirements. Those are the regulations most responsible for driving up premiums and destabilizing insurance markets.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson said the GOP health bill he is co-sponsoring will protect people with pre-existing conditions &quot;every bit as well as Obamacare did.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bill would keep the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s prohibition on denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would allow insurers -- unlike under Obamacare -- to charge people with pre-existing conditions premiums and provide them lesser benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Johnson&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-09-22T12:49:42.704972", "ruling_date": "2017-09-22T12:52:33", "ruling_headline": "Graham-Cassidy, the GOP alternative to Obamacare, weakens protections for pre-existing conditions", "ruling_headline_slug": "graham-cassidy-gop-alternative-obamacare-weakens-p", "ruling_link_text": "States could let insurers raise rates, provide less coverage", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>MSNBC, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFJIgAmT8dE\">Ron Johnson interview</a> (10:00), Sept. 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Ron Johnson spokesman Patrick McIlheran, Sept. 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBS Newshour, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/whats-new-gop-health-care-bill-one-simple-chart/\">&quot;What&rsquo;s in the new GOP health care bill, in one (simple) chart,&quot;</a> Sept. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/21/donald-trump/trumps-misleading-claim-pre-existing-protections/\">&quot;Trump&#39;s misleading claim on pre-existing protections in Graham-Cassidy,&quot;</a> Sept. 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen.
