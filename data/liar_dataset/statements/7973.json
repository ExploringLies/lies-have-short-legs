Virginia is among <a href=\"http://www.nrtw.org/rtws.htm\">24</a> right-to-work states and supporters have long argued the law spurs economic development and affirms personal freedom. It&rsquo;s become a rite that successful statewide candidates in the Old Dominion -- Democrats and Republicans -- bow at the law&rsquo;s altar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe expressed his fealty during a Jan. 21 <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/nfib-in-my-state/nfib-in-my-state-content?cmsid=61845\">speech</a> before the National Federation of Independent Business. &quot;We are a great right-to-work state,&quot; he said. &quot;We should never change that. It helps us do what we need to do to grow our businesses here in Virginia.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo we asked Cuccinelli&rsquo;s campaign for proof that McAuliffe &quot;opposes&quot; the right-to-work law and received a three-page response from spokeswoman Anna Nix.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMuch of the response centered on a June 18 <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-18/local/40049029_1_terry-mcauliffe-second-phase-anna-nix\">article</a> in The Washington Post that said McAuliffe, during a visit to Northern Virginia, &quot;declined to say whether he would protect the commonwealth&rsquo;s status as a right to work state or search for ways to make the state more friendly toward organized labor.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe&rsquo;s quoted response in the article, however, says nothing negative about right-to-work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m going to work with management. I&rsquo;m going to work with labor. I&rsquo;m going to work with everybody to move Virginia forward,&quot; McAuliffe said. &quot;It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;either-or.&rsquo; We are a right-to-work state that has been here for many years, and it&rsquo;s not going to change. But the focus has got to be not on trying to divide folks. [It] is, how do we work together to grow the Virginia economy to have the most diverse economy to bring in those 21st-century jobs?&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAt a June 20 news conference in Northern Virginia, McAuliffe was again asked whether he would try to &quot;soften or weaken&quot; the law. He <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IWdW5nD1-0\">replied</a>, &quot;Right-to-work has been the law here in Virginia for 65 years and I wouldn&rsquo;t change it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOther backup sent by Cuccinelli&rsquo;s campaign equated McAuliffe&rsquo;s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes the right-to-work law.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s a flawed argument. &quot;Just because he says, &#39;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with union people,&#39;&nbsp; doesn&rsquo;t mean he wants to do away with the right-to-work law,&quot; said James Meath, board chairman of Williams Mullen, a Richmond-based law firm. (Meath represents the Richmond Times-Dispatch in labor matters).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli&#39;s camp, for example, pointed us to a <a href=\"http://www.boilermakers.org/resources/news/2010_LEAP_focuses_on_jobs\">blog</a> posted by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers in spring 2010 discussing McAuliffe&rsquo;s plans, which he later dropped, to open an electric car manufacturing plant in Virginia. &quot;We&rsquo;re going to have 2,000 folks down there -- all of them union members,&quot; McAuliffe said of his employment plan.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMeath said it&rsquo;s legal for McAuliffe or anyone starting a Virginia business to contact a union and say, &quot;Send me all your people; I&rsquo;ll hire them.&quot; The right-to-work law merely states that the employer could not insist those workers remain in the union after they were hired, Meath said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli, in laying his charge against McAuliffe during the radio interview, also noted that his opponent has <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSc9cCbOlDw&amp;feature=youtu.be\">supported collective bargaining</a> for public workers and has received and has received &quot;hundreds of thousands of dollars&quot; in <a href=\"http://www.vpap.org/candidates/profile/money_in_industry1/11897\">campaign donations</a> from organized labor. These issues, however, do not compromise the right-to-work law. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-46855afc-a167-36de-5312-e8ef9cd0e343\">Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli said McAuliffe &quot;opposes&quot; the right-to-work law. He focuses on a June 18 news report that McAuliffe, during an interview, refused to defend right-to-work. But McAuliffe, in that article, did not criticize the popular law and was quoted as saying that right-to-work is &quot;not going to change.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOn at least two occasions prior to Cuccinelli&rsquo;s attack, McAuliffe stated that he would not try to alter the law, which he said &quot;helps grow our businesses here in Virginia.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli also makes a guilt-by-association argument, offering McAuliffe&rsquo;s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes right-to-work. But this, too, is a flimsy argument: It is entirely possible to support unions and the right-to-work law.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli fails to provide credible proof of his claim and we rate it False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-02T18:29:37.048585", "ruling_date": "2013-07-03T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cuccinelli says McAuliffe opposes Virginia's right-to-work law", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-opposes-virginias-right-", "ruling_link_text": "No credible proof", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tKen Cuccinelli, &quot;3/4 of VA Dems Support Right-To-Work;
