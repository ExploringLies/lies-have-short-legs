Supporters say ex-convicts who have a good job are less likely to break the law again.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCarolyn Medeiros, executive director of the Alliance for Safe Communities, was on WHJJ&#39;s &quot;Helen Glover Show&quot; Feb. 18 to express opposition to the proposal, saying the offenders pose an extra risk to employers and the community and shouldn&#39;t get preference over job seekers who have kept out of trouble.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&#39;re bending over backwards here for a minority of people,&quot; she said. &quot;Think of the other things that are afforded to them, Helen. There&#39;s a tax credit of $2,400 to bond them that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There&#39;s a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there&#39;s federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think we&#39;re doing plenty to help out this population,&quot; she said. &nbsp;&quot;I think we need to worry about the law-abiding citizen&#39;s fight to get a job now, and that should be at the top of our priority list.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo employers really get thousands of dollars in tax breaks and bond money for hiring convicted felons? And does the government offer special small business grants for ex-cons?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted Medeiros, who quickly referred us to various links on her website at ASC-RI.org. You can find them at the bottom of the <a href=\"http://asc-ri.org/re-entry-fast-and-furious-nationwide/\">&quot;Re-entry, &#39;Fast and Furious Nationwide&#39;&quot; section</a> of the site.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll start with the third part of her statement -- &quot;there&#39;s federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses&quot; -- because it&rsquo;s the simplest to judge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;Federal small business grants for convicted felons&quot; section of her page has links to two websites. <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.chron.com/small-business-grants-convicted-felons-17287.html\">The first</a> explicitly says, &quot;there are no grants set up to help felons start their own business&quot; and &quot;Felons are at a disadvantage when they apply for grants, but that doesn&#39;t preclude them from applying.&quot; <a href=\"http://businessgrantsfor.blogspot.com/2012/06/small-business-grants-for-convicted.html\">The second</a> says exactly the same thing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Medeiros&#39; owns sources contradict that part of her statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, let&#39;s look at her statement that &quot;There&#39;s a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer web page has a link to <a href=\"http://asc-ri.org/app/download/6920651404/Tax+Breaks+for+Hiring+Felons.pdf\">an unsourced document on the Alliance website</a>, which, she says, came from another source.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe tracked down what the document was talking about and found that employers do not, as Medeiros said, get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. Instead, employers can get a free bond -- the equivalent of an insurance policy worth $5,000 to $25,000 -- to cover the expenses of an ex-convict going rogue. <a href=\"http://bonds4jobs.com/\">The Federal Bonding Program</a> is financed by the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by individual states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaura Hart, spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, said $5,000 is the typical value of the seldom-used bonds given out in Rhode Island &quot;and it is only to insure the employer against theft, not against any other kind of behavior.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe employer must contact DLT after the ex-felon has been offered a job to arrange for the bond, and the potential employee must meet with DLT.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;All the bonding does is provide a different level of assurance to an employer to try to reconnect this particular population to the work force. Is anybody making money off this bond? The employer isn&#39;t,&quot; Hart said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Medeiros&rsquo; claim that &quot;there&#39;s a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon&quot; is mostly correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe erred in characterizing it as a bond. It&#39;s a tax credit. Called the <a href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/\">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</a>, it is designed to encourage employers to hire people in <a href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/eligible.cfm\">a variety of categories</a>, including veterans, food stamp and welfare recipients, and, most importantly for our purposes, &quot;an individual who has been convicted of a felony and has a hiring date that is not more than 1 year after the conviction or release from prison.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe credit can only be taken for the first year the ex-felon is on the job. The <a href=\"http://www.doleta.gov/business/Incentives/opptax/spreadsheets/calculator.xlsx\">amount of the credit</a> is capped at $2,400.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCarolyn Medeiros of the Alliance for Safe Communities said, &quot;There&#39;s a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There&#39;s a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there&#39;s federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe was mostly correct about the tax credit (although it doesn&#39;t involve a bond). But she was wrong on the other two points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause her statement contains some element of truth but gets some critical facts wrong, we rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Mostly False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
