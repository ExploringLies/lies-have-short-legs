Ferguson also pointed to contributions from Trump to Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s loyalties have not been exclusive to&nbsp;Republicans, Ferguson noted. In 2000, he launched a short-lived bid for the Reform Party&rsquo;s presidential nomination, receiving more than 15,000 votes in the party&rsquo;s California primary -- a tally that would have won him the state had he not already withdrawn from the race. Ferguson also directed us to his <a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/donald-trump-voter-history-764812\">complicated history</a> with party registration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the numbers show</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went to two authoritative databases of campaign finance data to examine Ferguson&rsquo;s numbers: OpenSecrets.org, to find federal donations, and FollowtheMoney.org, for state-level donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has actually been relatively evenhanded in doling out cash to the two parties, but since 1989, he&rsquo;s contributed over $350,000 more to Republicans running for federal and state offices, campaign finance records show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from the Federal Election Commission and state elections offices provided by the two websites show that Trump has given $584,850 to Democrats and $961,140 to the GOP over the last 26 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference in donations is almost entirely captured in Trump&rsquo;s recent giving. Since 2012, Trump has donated $463,450 to Republicans and just $3,500 to Democrats (California Attorney General&nbsp;Kamala Harris and New York Assemblyman Michael Benedetto).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve included those numbers below, with links to records of the individual contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Republicans</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Democrats</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Federal</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mz-m0P3kd7kiWFGuJ3SNpzjwd8znn4wpbvldTJ9RCUQ/edit?usp=sharing\">$703,900</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16vSCZ-VtJt1AEo9t1t7BrR0pkQM9zPHy-H6lpFK1X5k/edit?usp=sharing\">$327,600</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>State</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TEgOsurVWSDF6P2oeZPviSFqD_K6CjYVl4UUbyadWfk/edit?usp=sharing\">$257,240</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vvp_D0rH-8bd8qZr1vWTvaG_2aLr-kWd5wgkbbjKVWo/edit?usp=sharing\">$257,250</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>$961,140</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>$584,850</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Republicans</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Democrats</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1989-2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$497,690</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$581,350</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012-present</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$463,450</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$3,500</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Ferguson&rsquo;s claim might have been true had he uttered it just a few years ago. In 2011, a <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-donation-history-shows-democratic-favoritism/2011/04/25/AFDUddtE_story.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">analysis</a> of Trump&rsquo;s donations found the majority of them going to Democrats. But the flow of cash from Trump to&nbsp;Democrats has fallen off; the last time he gave to a Democrat running for federal office was in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t drill down into local and city politics because there is no single campaign finance database. But we should note that Trump donated $50,000 to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2010, as well as <a href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/CampaignDisclosure/ContributionsSearchByAllContributions.aspx?ddlContributionType=All+Types&amp;ddlLastOnlyNameSearchType=Starts+with&amp;txtLastOnlyName=Trump&amp;ddlFirstNameSearchType=Starts+with&amp;txtFirstName=Donald&amp;ddlAddressSearchType=Starts+with&amp;txtAddress=&amp;ddlCitySearchType=Starts+with&amp;txtCity=&amp;ddlState=&amp;txtZip=&amp;txtZipThru=&amp;ddlOccupationSearchType=Starts+with&amp;txtOccupation=&amp;ddlEmployerSearchType=Starts+with&amp;txtEmployer=&amp;txtAmount=&amp;txtAmountThru=&amp;txtRcvDate=&amp;txtRcvDateThru=&amp;ddlOrderBy=Last+or+Only+Name+-+A+to+Z&amp;ddlVendorLastOnlyName=Starts+with&amp;txtVendorLastOnlyName=&amp;ddlVendorFirstName=Starts+with&amp;txtVendorFirstName=&amp;ddlVendorAddress=Starts+with&amp;txtVendorAddress=&amp;ddlVendorCity=Starts+with&amp;txtVendorCity=&amp;ddlVendorState=&amp;txtVendorZip=&amp;txtVendorZipThru=&amp;ddlPurpose=Starts+with&amp;txtPurpose=\">over $25,000 more</a> to other Cook County Democrats, among other donations that he&rsquo;s made on the local level. (Trump has <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/06/16/controversy-in-chicago-over-donald-trumps-name-in-city-skyline/\">made his presence known</a> in the Windy City.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, however, the real estate mogul&rsquo;s gifts to Republican candidates and organizations increased dramatically. Since 2010, Trump has donated $124,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and given another $50,000 to American Crossroads, a conservative super PAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A mix of politics and business</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that just as Trump&rsquo;s political ambitions and private business interests often seem to overlap, it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to parse out the exact motivations behind many of his political contributions over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an influential real estate developer in the Northeast and in cities around the world, Trump&rsquo;s contributions may have not have much to do with one&rsquo;s political party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1996 to 2007, for instance, Trump made 12 separate donations to New Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican who represents the Garden State&rsquo;s Second Congressional District. The district includes Atlantic City, where the Trump Organization <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/100463592\">used to have significant holdings</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While conservatives like Ferguson have criticized Trump for his donations to Democrats, Trump defended himself as having no viable Republican options in overwhelmingly blue states like New York. &quot;Everyone&rsquo;s Democratic,&quot; <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4645819/donald-trump-on-hannity/#sp=show-clips\">he told Sean Hannity</a> in 2011. &quot;So what am I going to do &mdash; contribute to Republicans? One thing: I&rsquo;m not stupid. Am I going to contribute to Republicans for my whole life when they get heat when they run against some Democrat and the most they can get is 1 percent of the vote?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferguson said that Trump has &quot;given more money to Democratic candidates than Republican candidates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t say definitively that his claim is wrong at all levels of government, since we don&rsquo;t have the local data. But public records show that the real estate tycoon has actually contributed around $350,000 more to Republicans at the state and federal level than Democrats. That, however, is a recent development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferguson&rsquo;s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-09T15:54:25.390370", "ruling_date": "2015-07-09T18:29:04", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump's campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trumps-campaign-contributions-democrats-and", "ruling_link_text": "Money, like Trump, has been shifting to the right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NPR.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/16/414609787/5-things-you-should-know-about-donald-trump\">5 Things You Should Know About Donald Trump</a>,&quot; June&nbsp;16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets.org, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/\">Donor Lookup Database</a>,&quot; searched July&nbsp;3, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://followthemoney.org/\">FollowTheMoney.org</a> database, searched July&nbsp;6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-donation-history-shows-democratic-favoritism/2011/04/25/AFDUddtE_story.html\">Trump&rsquo;s donation history shows Democratic favoritism</a>,&quot; April&nbsp;26, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-switches-party-affiliation-to-independent/\">Donald Trump switches party affiliation to independent</a>,&quot; Dec. 23, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Illinois State Board of Elections, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/CampaignDisclosure/ContributionsSearchByAllContributions.aspx\">Contributions Search</a>&quot; database, searched July&nbsp;7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/06/16/controversy-in-chicago-over-donald-trumps-name-in-city-skyline/\">Controversity in Chicago over Donald Trump&rsquo;s name in city skyline</a>,&quot; June&nbsp;16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Smoking Gun, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/donald-trump-voter-history-764812\">After Registering As A Republican, Independent, Democrat, And Republican, Donald Trump Has Now Opted Not To Enroll In A Party</a>,&quot; Feb. 2, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNBC.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/100463592\">Atlantic City&rsquo;s Trump Plaza Sold For Fire-Sale Price</a>,&quot; Feb. 15, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannity, &quot;<a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4645819/donald-trump-on-hannity/#sp=show-clips\">Trump Interview</a>,&quot; April&nbsp;14, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Ben", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3237, "last_name": "Ferguson", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "ben-ferguson", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/2013-07-20-CNN-Lemon-Ferguson.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3237/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Donald Trump has &quot;given more money to Democratic candidates than Republican candidates.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on CNN", "statement_date": "2015-07-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
