Roger Williams, a Republican, and Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat, quoted Williams as saying that he favors spending cuts and opposes an increase in the federal debt limit. Williams also indicated he&rsquo;s not happy about the shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I didn&rsquo;t want the government to shut down, I didn&rsquo;t get my laundry out&quot; of the congressional laundry before it shut down, Williams said. Doggett said he didn&rsquo;t know there was a congressional laundry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re here to serve. Did the federal shutdown also shutter a congressional laundry?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, spokeswomen for Williams and Doggett each said a dry cleaning store housed in a Capitol office building shut its doors due to the government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams spokeswoman Haley Graves said: &quot;The laundry is just a local laundry/dry cleaning branch that&rsquo;s located on the Capitol complex and open to the public. It was closed due to the shutdown, so anyone who dropped off suits/shirts/alterations before Oct. 1 aren&rsquo;t able to get them out at this time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doggett spokeswoman Kelsey Crow agreed the basement laundry, which we identified as ClassiCleaners in the Longworth House Office Building, closed due to the shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A web search led us to a Feb. 23, 2010, <a href=\"https://americandrycleaner.com/articles/us-house-selects-classicleaners-help-green-capitol\"><u>article</u></a> in American Drycleaner, a trade publication, stating the House had chosen ClassiCleaners &quot;as its new, official &lsquo;green&rsquo; drycleaning service provider.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crow also emailed us a photo (posted above) showing what looks like the door to a ClassiCleaners store with two signs, one saying &quot;Closed&quot; and the other stating: &quot;Due to the government shutdown, this facility is closed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We repeatedly telephoned the ClassiCleaners and every time got disconnected. But a search of <em>The Washington Post</em> led us to a Sept. 26, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/09/26/what-happens-to-congress-if-the-government-shuts-down/\"><u>post</u></a> on the newspaper&rsquo;s Federal Eye blog stating that if the federal shutdown occurred, Capitol Hill &quot;service providers&quot; required to close would include stationery stores, &quot;the dry cleaners&quot; and other offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article linked to undated web pages overseen by the House Administration Committee including one forecasting the open/closed status of Capitol facilities in the event of a government shutdown. <a href=\"http://cha.house.gov/sites/republicans.cha.house.gov/files/documents/committee_docs/Expected%20Levels%20of%20Service%20During%20a%20Lapse%20in%20Appropriations_7.pdf\"><u>According to the committee</u></a>, the House &quot;cleaners&quot; would be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 3, 2013, which we took as an indication it otherwise would be closed. According to the committee&rsquo;s page, the House stationery, gift, beauty and barber shops also were to be closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams said a congressional laundry was closed due to the government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Save for a few hours the first Thursday of October, the House&rsquo;s official cleaners was closed in connection with the partial government shutdown.
