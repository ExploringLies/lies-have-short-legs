But do taxpayers foot the bill for MARTA to that great of an extent?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s look at what MARTA&rsquo;s ridership pays into the system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMARTA has one of the highest fare rates in the nation following a fare hike from $2 to $2.50 per ride last fall. Helped by a recent fare increase, the agency projects fare revenue this year of $130.3 million &ndash; 31 percent of its operating costs. Last year, fares covered 29 percent of operating costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimple math says Bittner&rsquo;s figures are askew. If riders are paying almost a third, taxpayers can&rsquo;t be subsidizing 80 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our Libertarian friend is dead wrong,&quot; MARTA spokesman Lyle Harris concluded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut how far off is he? Let&rsquo;s look at the taxpayer side of the MARTA coin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe largest part of MARTA&rsquo;s current $413.8 million in transit costs is paid by local sales tax. MARTA gets $201.2 million from the penny tax collected in Fulton and DeKalb counties and the city of Atlanta. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn top of this, the federal government kicks in $37.8 million. A sore point for MARTA backers is that the state of Georgia makes no direct contribution to operate the city&rsquo;s transit service.<br />\r\n\tIn all, MARTA is paying for bus, rail and other services with $239 million in local and federal taxpayer money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe service rounds out its revenue pie with some other sources of income. Advertising on buses, parking fees and land leases bring the non-taxpayer funds to $152.1 million.<br />\r\n\tMARTA tapped its reserve fund to plug a $22.7 million hole in its operating budget. Officials say the reserve fund is &quot;mixed&quot; with taxes and other revenue, but they said the money pulled for this year&rsquo;s operating budget comes from the sale of real estate decades ago and some other non-tax sources. If the deficit persists, MARTA may end up pulling more tax money out of reserves to fund transit in coming years. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith figures in hand, the rest is just math: Taxpayers subsidize 57.8 percent of MARTA&rsquo;s operating costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTen years ago, fares made up more than a third of MARTA&rsquo;s budget, and while ridership is down from 2002, that&rsquo;s not why taxpayers are being asked to foot more of the bill. Fares increased 13 percent in actual dollars from 2002 to 2011, but the service&rsquo;s operating expenses increased 38 percent. That gap has to be made up somewhere, and Bittner is right about where, even if the exact percentage is off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I only looked at the cost per trip and the fare per trip. I didn&rsquo;t use the ancillary figures in the budget,&quot; he said. &quot;We&rsquo;re still subsidizing over half as taxpayers, especially those of us who live and work in Fulton and DeKalb.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn rebuttal, Harris points out every mode of transportation &ndash; including road building &ndash; is subsidized by taxes to some extent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat argument aside, Bittner was significantly off in assigning 80 percent of the costs of a MARTA trip to the taxpayer, even if he stands by the larger point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim as Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-17T15:24:32.768678", "ruling_date": "2012-05-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "MARTA subsidy claim derailed by facts", "ruling_headline_slug": "marta-subsidy-claim-derailed-facts", "ruling_link_text": "Transit claim goes off track", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Marietta Daily Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/18426154/article-Group-doesn%E2%80%99t-plan-to-show-TIA-much-TLC\">Group doesn&rsquo;t plan to show TIA much TLC</a>,&quot; May 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.itsmarta.com/uploadedFiles/About_MARTA/Reports/FY%202012%20Budget%20Book.pdf\">MARTA Fiscal Year 2012 Adopted Operating &amp; Capital Funds Budget</a>, MARTA Office of Management and Budget<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with Brett Bittner, executive director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia, May 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from MARTA spokesman Lyle Harris, May 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with MARTA Chief Financial Officer Davis Allen, May 10-11, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Executive Director, Libertarian Party of Geo", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Brett", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1861, "last_name": "Bittner", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "brett-bittner", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 5, "party": "Libertarian", "party_slug": "libertarian", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/5/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Brett_Bittner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1861/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tTaxpayers subsidize 80 percent of each MARTA trip</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2012-05-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
