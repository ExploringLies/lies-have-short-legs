We rated those Cruz-related memes Pants on Fire or False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim is no different. The meme says Cruz made this statement during his speech at a 2014 Conservative Political Action Committee conference. We watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uk8a0FapUw\">a video of the speech</a>. He does not mention gay people, mass shootings or public nudity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2015/jun/11/teabagger-group-distorts-ted-cruz-and-others-image/\">had an About section</a> that says the page &quot;is for entertainment purposes&quot; and is &quot;primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages.&quot; However, the meme that&rsquo;s reappeared on social media three years later does not have this disclaimer attached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz didn&rsquo;t blame public nudity or mass shootings on gay people.
