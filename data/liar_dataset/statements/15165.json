Andrew M. Cuomo called public housing in New York City &quot;disgusting&quot; when he visited a unit earlier this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He blamed the New York City Housing Authority for neglecting maintenance on the aging system, which <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nycha/downloads/pdf/factsheet.pdf\">houses</a> one of every 14 city residents. The state has done its part by footing part of the bill, Cuomo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only housing authority in the state that we have actually given money to is NYCHA,&quot; Cuomo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about 160 housing authorities in the state. New York City&rsquo;s authority provides housing to more than 147,000 families, more than any other authority. Most authorities receive almost all of their funding from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Cuomo right that the state doesn&rsquo;t give any money to housing authorities outside New York City?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the budget</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A state Division of Budget spokesperson, on behalf of the Cuomo administration,&nbsp;defended the governor&#39;s statement, saying the New York City Housing Authority is the only housing authority in the state to have a direct funding line in the state budget.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State lawmakers&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/301-15/de-blasio-administration-300-million-nycha-roof-replacement-the-next-three-years\">approved</a> $100 million for the authority in 2015 to replace roofs across the public housing system over a three-year period. Also, $200 million was <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/n-y-senate-poised-pass-budget-bills-contentious-day-article-1.3019424\">approved</a> in last year&rsquo;s state budget for more roof maintenance and other repairs, like new boilers. Cuomo has recently proposed an additional $250 million for NYCHA in this year&rsquo;s budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other housing authorities have access to state funds, but they have to either apply for funding from a statewide program or compete for grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The governor is correct that the only housing authority that got direct grants to their housing authority was NYCHA,&quot; said William Simmons, president of the New York State Public Housing Authority Directors Association, which represents the majority of housing authorities in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Any dollars that go toward housing authorities in upstate New York, these are dollars that they compete for or apply for. It&rsquo;s not a direct allocation,&quot; Simmons continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other funds</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authorities&nbsp;can compete for funds from the Public Housing Preservation Program. The program awards funds to improve the long-term sustainability of existing public housing units. Authorities compete for the money through a bidding process with New York State Homes and Community Renewal, the state housing agency. Six authorities have received a total of $125 million from this program in the past two state budgets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authorities can also apply for funding from the Public Housing Modernization Program. The money is used by housing developments where rental income and other funding isn&rsquo;t enough to pay for regular maintenance. About $6.4 million goes to 13 state-supervised public housing authorities in New York state each year through this program, according to the Division of Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State tax credits are also available for authorities that develop public housing for low-income residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only housing authority in the state that we have actually given money to is NYCHA,&quot; Cuomo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York City Housing Authority is the only public housing agency that has a line item in the budget. But other housing authorities have received money from the state through competitive grant programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the New York City Housing Authority is not the only housing authority to receive money from the state. We rate Cuomo&#39;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-21T12:38:44.228752", "ruling_date": "2018-03-23T16:03:19", "ruling_headline": "Have other housing authorities in NY been given money like NYCHA?", "ruling_headline_slug": "nycha-only-housing-authority-get-money-state-budge", "ruling_link_text": "Other funds available too", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-directs-state-health-department-investigate-public-health-and-safety-hazards\">Governor Cuomo Directs Health Department to Investigate Hazards at NYCHA Properties</a>,&quot;
