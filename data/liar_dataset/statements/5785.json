Burton further pointed out that there were no statewide issues on the May 2009 ballot, according to an April 24, 2009, <em>American-Statesman </em><a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/cityhall/entries/2009/04/24/secretary_of_state_homestead_e.html\">news blog</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimilarly, there are no proposed constitutional amendments on the <a href=\"http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20120512/sample_ballot.pdf\">May 12, 2012 ballot</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next statewide elections are the Republican and Democratic primaries on May 29, 2012. Proposed constitutional amendments do not appear on primary ballots.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally: It&rsquo;s not uncommon for chain emails to say Texans are voting on an issue not on the ballot.
