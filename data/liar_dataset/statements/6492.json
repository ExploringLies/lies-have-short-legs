And he&rsquo;ll also appear as the GOP vice presidential candidate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan discussed this oddity Aug. 12, 2012, on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; -- his first TV interview after being picked by Mitt Romney as his running mate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCBS correspondent Bob Schieffer asked Ryan: &quot;Now I understand you&#39;re also gonna run for reelection in your congressional seat. Are you kind of hedging your bets here?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No, I&#39;m already on the ballot,&quot; Ryan responded. &quot;You can&#39;t even go off the ballot. So I&#39;ve already filed. Our filing deadline was in June. I&#39;m already on the ballot, so it has nothing to do with that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat comment raised a few eyebrows: Is Ryan really requiredto be on the ballot twice?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, yes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s due to a quirk in state law and the timing of Ryan&rsquo;s pick, according to Reid Magney, spokesman for the state Government Accountability Board, which runs elections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState law generally prohibits a candidate to appear on the same ballot for two partisan offices. But there is one exception: If he&rsquo;s running for president or vice president.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat so-called &quot;favorite son&quot; law was passed in the late 1960s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the timing question: Ryan, who is seeking an eighth term in the U.S. House, had until June 1, 2012, to submit his name for re-election to the 1st Congressional District seat. He did so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Government Accountability Board met June 8, 2012, and approved his and other names for the fall ballot. (Indeed, that included the Aug. 14, 2012, primary election, three days after his VP pick. Ryan&rsquo;s name was listed even though he was unopposed for the GOP nod.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn November, Ryan faces Democrat Rob Zerban of Kenosha.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s only one way for a candidate to get his name off the ballot after the accountability board has acted -- and it takes, well, a pretty extreme step.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe candidate would have to die.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven then, the death would have to happen before the ballot was printed, Magney said. Ballots are printed about 50 days before an election and they don&rsquo;t get reprinted because of a death.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan said since he&rsquo;s already on the ballot for re-election to Congress he could not get his name removed. Indeed, at this stage, death is the only way off the House ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Ryan&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-17T15:35:40.872733", "ruling_date": "2012-08-20T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ryan says candidates for Congress can\u2019t remove themselves from the ballot", "ruling_headline_slug": "ryan-says-candidates-congress-cant-remove-themselv", "ruling_link_text": "To get off you have to be six-feet under", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCBS <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57491710/romney-ryan-the-first-interview/?tag=contentMain;cbsCarousel\">&quot;60 Minutes&quot; Aug. 12, 2012</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/ryan-would-be-able-to-stay-on-ballot-for-reelection-d36f2o1-165826096.html\">&quot;Ryan to stay on ballot for reelection,&quot;</a> Aug. 11, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTelephone interview, Reid Magney, spokesman, Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, Aug. 16, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 24, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 373, "last_name": "Ryan", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "paul-ryan", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_WX201_HOUSE_2016_PRIMARI.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/373/", "total_count": 89, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.house.gov/ryan/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays under Wisconsin law, he cannot remove his name from the ballot for re-election to Congress.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television interview", "statement_date": "2012-08-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
