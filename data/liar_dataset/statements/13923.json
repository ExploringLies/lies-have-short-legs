Yet estimates vary surrounding the level to which it will increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One study <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/agec.12089/abstract\">from 2014</a> in the academic journal <em>Agricultural&nbsp;Economics</em> stated food demand might increase by 59 percent to 98 percent between 2005 and 2050. Another study contributed to the <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/50/20260.full\">National Academy of Sciences </a>in 2011 said crop demand might rise by 100 to 110 percent between 2005 and 2050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those estimates are close to the increase of 50 percent to 97 percent Spicer mentioned, though Spicer&rsquo;s claim didn&rsquo;t specify a start date for his projection. (We asked for clarification but didn&rsquo;t get a response.) The start date matters, because if it&rsquo;s 2017 -- as a casual listener would probably assume -- then Spicer&rsquo;s estimate is likely too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Kaiser, a Cornell University professor and an expert in food demand, said about a 39 percent increase in global food demand seemed more accurate (though he said other factors, like global changes in diet, might contribute to a higher estimate). He calculated that figure based on projected increases in population multiplied by projected increases in per-capita food demand using 2012 <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/ap106e/ap106e.pdf\">data</a> from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Bottom line: This is way lower than Spicer&rsquo;s claim of between 50 to 90 percent growth in world food demand by 2050,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Waite, an associate from from the World Resources Institute&rsquo;s Food Program also told us that Spicer&rsquo;s estimate was too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He explained that forecasts of this nature &quot;can be a little misleading&quot; &nbsp;because the base year for frequently used data is often in the past. Waite estimated a roughly 45 percent increase in food demand from 2017, but noted that it was a fairly common &quot;mistake&quot;&nbsp;to use projected figures from 2006 in the way Spicer did. The World Resources Institute estimated about a 70 percent increase in global food demand between 2006 and 2050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reasons for increasing global food demand</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several factors impact rates of global food demand: growth in population and income are two of the most important ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates show the projected world population will be around <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2013/12/global-food-challenge-explained-18-graphics\">9.6 billion</a> by 2050, up from roughly 7.5 billion currently, and per-capita income is expected to rise to <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/ap106e/ap106e.pdf\">1.8 times what it was in 2012. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Population increases the number of mouths to feed, while income growth tends to increase the amount of calories the people eat. Income increases can also create a shift in diet as lower-income individuals may have better access to protein-heavy foods like livestock and fish as their incomes rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the World Resources Institute expects a<a href=\"http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/shifting_diets_0.jpg\"> 23 percent global increase in consumption of livestock and cattle between&nbsp;2006 to 2050. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer said that global food demand would increase by 50 to 98 percent by 2050. Recent projections agree with general thrust of his forecast, but it seems likely that Spicer&rsquo;s claim is a little too high to be completely on target. We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e0ffe0c-c964-466d-8119-10dd50b67863\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e0ffe0c-c964-466d-8119-10dd50b67863</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-29T22:45:23.128072", "ruling_date": "2017-03-30T10:49:00", "ruling_headline": "How much will global food demand grow by 2050?", "ruling_headline_slug": "spicer-mostly-accurate-global-food-demand-projecti", "ruling_link_text": "A little too high, but in the right direction", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>David Tilman et al, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/50/20260.short\">Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture, </a>March 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hugo Valin et al, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/agec.12089/abstract\">The future of food demand: understanding differences in global economic models</a>, Abstract, March 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/expert_paper/How_to_Feed_the_World_in_2050.pdf\">How to Feed the World in 2050</a>, March 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/ap106e/ap106e.pdf\">WORLD AGRICULTURE TOWARDS 2030/2050, The 2012 Revision</a>, March 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Resources Institute, <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2013/12/global-food-challenge-explained-18-graphics\">The Global Food Challenge Explained in 18 Graphics</a>, March 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harvard Business Review, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/global-demand-for-food-is-rising-can-we-meet-it\">Global Demand for Food Is Rising.
