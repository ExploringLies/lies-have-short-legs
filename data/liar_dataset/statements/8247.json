And depending on how long its been since you&rsquo;ve read it, the government can read it, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the claim U.S. Rep. Tom Graves made in a <a href=\"http://tomgraves.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=VVVBM2TQZ2KA4HDTWDYT726BLU\"><u>district update</u></a> to his constituents this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s shocking, but true,&quot; Graves, R-Ranger, said in the emailed update. &quot;The government does not need a warrant to read your old emails. How can this be? Simply put, our privacy laws are outdated.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since May, when former government defense contractor Edward Snowden leaked the details of two National Security Agency spy programs that track phone and Internet communications, there has been a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/jul/02/are-americans-being-targeted-surveillance/\"><u>heightened interest</u></a> in how much privacy Americans actually have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia gets and sends a lot of email. We wanted to know whether our bygone missives could be subject to government perusal, so we went looking for answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graves&rsquo; update referenced the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1852\"><u>Email Privacy Act</u></a> that he introduced, along with U.S. Reps. Kevin Yoder and Jared Polis, to update the current electronic communication privacy laws. The bill, introduced in May, has gained 137 bipartisan co-sponsors and has been referred to a House committee. The Graves bill is a companion to a similar bill being pushed in the Senate by U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee. The <a href=\"http://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=e42ba48d-66e3-4f20-ae5a-bf7c51ea5916\"><u>Senate bill</u></a> passed out of committee and is up for a full chamber vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If passed, both bills would update the current law that governs data storage, the <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119\"><u>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</u></a>. The ECPA, passed in 1986, regulates government access to private information that is transmitted and stored on the Internet, such as email. The law considers emails stored on third-party servers for longer than 180 days as abandoned. The 1986 law allows federal agencies to obtain a subpoena -- but doesn&rsquo;t require a warrant from a judge -- to view the records. (Emails less than 180 days old do require a judicial warrant to obtain.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The (ECPA) was written at a time when people didn&rsquo;t store emails on a server and there was no cloud. Storage was expensive and most people didn&rsquo;t keep emails long -- they downloaded things to the desktop,&quot; said Mark Stanley, a campaign and communications strategist for the <a href=\"https://www.cdt.org/\">Center for Democracy and Technology</a>, a nonprofit public policy organization that works to improve privacy in communications technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the law was written, users of the early Internet often downloaded emails directly to their hard drives to save them. &nbsp;Service providers <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/ecpa-electronic-communications-privacy-act_n_2211889.html\"><u>deleted</u></a> messages on their servers immediately to free up valuable storage space. Today, storage space is practically unlimited. Deleting messages from your inbox doesn&rsquo;t preclude them from still existing on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive, your email provider&rsquo;s server, or in the inbox or on the server of the person receiving the email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graves&rsquo; email privacy act would drop the 180-day provision from the existing law and require a warrant to obtain the emails. The bill &quot;would ensure that Fourth Amendment protections Americans already have for mail, phone calls, and other paper/hard documents are extended to their soft communications too,&quot; the three congressmen <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/06/how-ridiculous-is-it-that-email-but-not-mail-has-been-left-out-of-privacy-laws/all\"><u>wrote</u></a> in a Wired op-ed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One exception exists to the current electronic communications privacy law, but not in our area. A ruling in a 2010 federal appeals court case, <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1170760837547673255&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><u>United States v. Warshak</u></a>, found that police violated a man&rsquo;s constitutional rights by reading his emails without a warrant. The Supreme Court has not addressed this case, and the ruling only applies to states in the court&rsquo;s 6th Circuit jurisdiction of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of this ruling, email and Internet companies Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/279441-facebook-email-providers-require-warrant-for-private-data\"><u>require</u></a> warrants and subpoenas to release emails and other stored data. But there is no guarantee that their requirements would hold up in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://digitaldueprocess.org/index.cfm?objectid=37940370-2551-11DF-8E02000C296BA163\"><u>coalition</u></a> of communications, privacy and human rights groups have lobbied Congress to update the current electronic data bill. The Washington Post editorial board urged lawmakers to close the <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-10/opinions/40492050_1_nsa-leaks-law-enforcement-edward-snowden\"><u>email loophole</u></a> in a July editorial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Privacy expert and professor John Soma, who leads the Privacy Foundation at the University of Denver, &nbsp;also vouched for Graves&rsquo; claim. Soma said the legislators&rsquo; bill is tame in regards to what data management changes should be made to the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But getting the bill passed could be difficult. GovTrack, which follows federal legislation, gives Graves&rsquo; bill only an 8 percent chance of being enacted; the Senate bill fares a bit better at 14 percent. Soma gives it a better chance, especially after Snowden revealed the government&rsquo;s surveillance practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;d give (the bill) a 50-50 chance, maybe more,&quot; Soma said. &quot;We do need a change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, does Graves&rsquo; claim about email make it to the inbox or get filtered &nbsp;into junk mail?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Georgia congressman said the government doesn&rsquo;t need a warrant to read our old emails. Current law, in place before many modern technology advances, does not include a provision protecting email over 180 days old from the government&rsquo;s prying eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graves and a cadre of congressional members are working to update the privacy laws. But in the meantime the old rules stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Graves&rsquo; claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-09-09T16:26:28.510355", "ruling_date": "2013-09-10T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Your old emails could be in government inbox now", "ruling_headline_slug": "your-old-emails-could-be-government-inbox-now", "ruling_link_text": "Claim deserves to remain in your inbox", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Rep.
