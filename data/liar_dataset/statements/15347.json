The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents,&quot; the post said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also claimed that vaccinations promoted in India by the Gates Foundation &quot;were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls&quot; and that it conducted experimental vaccine trials. But PunditFact in December 2016 debunked a post on an anti-vaccine blog claiming Gates used &quot;30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer&quot; and that vaccination efforts led to deaths.

Then, when families decide to have fewer children, the next generation is much smaller. Eventually, a country ends up with relatively more people in the labor force producing economically&mdash;and relatively fewer dependents (very old or very young people),&quot; Bill Gates said in the 2018 letter. &quot;That&rsquo;s a recipe for rapid economic development, especially if countries take advantage of it by investing in health and education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Mysterious Times&rsquo; post Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-03T10:50:35.128535", "ruling_date": "2018-05-03T10:58:56", "ruling_headline": "No, Bill Gates did not outline 2018 plan to depopulate the planet", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-bill-gates-did-not-outline-2018-plan-depopulate", "ruling_link_text": "Not Gates' plan", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mysterious-times.com, <a href=\"http://www.mysterious-times.com/2018/04/30/bill-gates-outlines-2018-plan-to-depopulate-the-planet/\">Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Plane</a>, April 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mysterious-times.com, <a href=\"http://www.mysterious-times.com/category/conspiracy/\">Conspiracy</a> page</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/01/Bill-and-Melinda-Gates-Pledge-$10-Billion-in-Call-for-Decade-of-Vaccines\">Bill and Melinda Gates Pledge $10 Billion in Call for Decade of Vaccines | Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/dec/20/blog-posting/anti-vaccination-blog-revives-debunked-hpv-story/\">Anti-vaccination blog revives debunked HPV story</a>, Dec. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/Mysterious-Times-644662059031058/about/?ref=page_internal\">Mysterious Times page</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, @BillGates <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billgates/status/167698887660937217?lang=en\">tweet</a>, Feb. 9, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=122949985\">Bill Gates Sets Out His Global Charitable Goals</a>, Jan. 25, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill and Melinda Gates <a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/2018-Annual-Letter\">2018 Annual Letter</a>, Feb. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Planet.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-04-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
