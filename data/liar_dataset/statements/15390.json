Greg Abbott in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was asked in a May 8, 2018 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/startelegram/videos/10156443762693530/?comment_id=10156446065538530&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R0%22%7D\">Facebook Live interview</a> by the <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em> editorial board if she still carries her service firearm and how she believes&nbsp;gun laws should change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valdez, who favors universal background checks for gun purchases, replied: &quot;You know, I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in all the amendments. And I continue to carry my weapon. That&rsquo;s part of my morning routine. It&rsquo;s been for over 40 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valdez went on to say that a person &quot;who cannot solve their issues by other than total violence should never be allowed to carry a weapon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next came her&nbsp;hunting claim. Valdez said: &quot;There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting. That&rsquo;s a source of sports for them. But that isn&rsquo;t a source of violence for the majority of those folks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valdez&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our inquiries about the basis for her hunting claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Agencies, school districts unaware of hunting holidays</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we queried the Texas Education Agency, spokeswoman Lauren Callahan responded that districts set their own calendars. <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us_Docs_ED_htm_ED.25.htm-2325.081&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=QvQrCjPtO9cKGOfGYlNgXQ&amp;r=gMzwfpRdYrNiKB230pQwEHvOg7yPnZ8KN6yHpK9HhxY&amp;m=AHye8E0sxg9M_ZukGlxorCa954sW2gwmb9oo73sR3IE&amp;s=GrjGm-rbaKZiy-h9ZUF2ys1xms6nCet5TKqFvdOFL50&amp;e=\">State law</a> requires each district to operate for at least 75,600 minutes a school year unless the state education commissioner grants permission to run short. &quot;While districts may consult agency staff for guidance as they adopt a local calendar, they do not submit the calendars to us for approval once they are adopted,&quot; Callahan said by email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department, Steve Lightfoot replied by email that in 2018, the Texas dove hunting and deer hunting seasons begin on Saturdays--Sept. 1 and Nov. 3, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Parks &amp; Wildlife Commission, Lightfoot said, &quot;supports providing opportunities to get youth involved in Texas&rsquo;s rich hunting traditions, and sets aside youth-only weekends for that reason. I checked with staff who would know and they are unaware of schools or districts that close in recognition of hunting season,&quot; Lightfoot said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also connected with Don Rogers, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.txrea.com/\">Texas Rural Education Association</a>; Rogers told us he was about to huddle with directors of the state&rsquo;s regional education service centers. After that meeting, Rogers said by phone that none of the directors was aware of a district currently calling a holiday at the start of a hunting season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, we also came up empty with a pair of Central Texas districts in hunting communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James Payne of the Llano Independent School District said he&rsquo;s worked in varied districts for 26 years and not heard of a district taking a holiday for the sake of a hunting season. &quot;Do you think she was saying that in jest?&quot; Payne said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duane Limbaugh, superintendent of the Brady ISD, said that district doesn&rsquo;t take a day off for the sake of hunting though he&rsquo;s heard of districts declaring a staff work day for the start of a hunting season. In his experience, he said, most student hunters get their hunting done in time to be in school by mid-morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valdez declared: &quot;There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t learn how Valdez reached this conclusion, for which we found no confirmation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is not accurate.
