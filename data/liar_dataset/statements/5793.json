Chris Christie unveiled a proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, saying property taxes are more of a burden for New Jersey residents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) reiterated that point during a recent radio interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In New Jersey our constituents want to see the Legislature and the governor focus on cutting the property taxes. The average New Jerseyan pays close to $8,000 a year and that is just average,&quot; Oliver told Steve Adubato Jr. on WOR-AM on April 19.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, if you took a family with an average income of $50,000 -- which, by the way, $57,000 is the mean in our state -- that would provide $80 over a three-year period in the pockets of a New Jersey family. That is not anything of significance. We say that won&#39;t buy a bag of groceries for a working-class family,&quot; Oliver said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/22/lou-greenwald/lou-greenwald-claims-governors-proposed-income-tax/\">previously checked a statement</a> about potential savings from the governor&rsquo;s income tax cut proposal. It&rsquo;s true a couple with a taxable income of $50,000 would pay about $80 less in income taxes under Christie&rsquo;s plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is Oliver right that the average family in New Jersey lives on $57,000 a year?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note that economists generally prefer median income to mean income, since the mean income can be skewed by extremes, such as very high-income earners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert Bernstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau, said since the mean can be distorted &quot;it&#39;s not a good reflection of the situation there. Median is better.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe median income is the amount in the middle when a series of numbers are ordered smallest to largest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy either measure, Oliver is wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mean family income in New Jersey was $106,125 in 2010, according to the most recent data available from the American Community Survey, a yearly national assessment conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The median family income, according to the same survey, was $82,427.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, told us Oliver meant to refer to the annual average wage in New Jersey, not the average family income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s a significant difference between the two.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe annual average wage is calculated by determining the total amount of wages paid out in a year and dividing by all the workers covered by the state&rsquo;s unemployment insurance system who got a paycheck.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe figure is &quot;based on workers employed at New Jersey companies, those workers may or may not be New Jersey residents,&quot; Brian Murray, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a state labor department report released in 2011, the annual average wage in New Jersey was $56,385 in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOliver said, &quot;$57,000 is the mean [income] in our state&quot; for a family.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not true. The mean family income in New Jersey in 2010 was $106,125 and the median income, a measure less influenced by very high-income earners, was $82,427.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Oliver&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/politifact_nj_sheila_oliver_sa.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-24T15:58:50.218694", "ruling_date": "2012-04-25T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Sheila Oliver says the average family income in New Jersey is $57,000", "ruling_headline_slug": "sheila-oliver-says-average-family-income-new-jerse", "ruling_link_text": "More than $100K in 2010", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWOR-AM, <a href=\"http://www.wor710.com/topic/play_window.php?audioType=Episode&amp;audioId=5805352\">Interview with Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver</a>, April 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Tom Hester Jr., spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.assemblydems.com/\">New Jersey Assembly Democrats</a>, April 19 &amp;
