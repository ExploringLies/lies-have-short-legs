The first cell phone was sold for $3,995 in March of 1984.&quot; (The claim is accompanied by the image of an ancient-looking Motorola cell phone.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we found no evidence that Ford ever made that claim.

After the alleged attack by Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, she testified:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;Brett&rsquo;s assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. &hellip; Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither of these accounts mentions a cell phone call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"https://plus.cq.com/doc/congressionaltranscripts-5395685?7\">questioning</a> from Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor retained by the Republican Judiciary Committee majority to question Ford and Kavanaugh, Ford said she did not recall how she got home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>Mitchell: &quot;You&#39;ve described this as being near the country club, wherever this house was, is that right?&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>Ford: &quot;I would describe it as it&#39;s somewhere between my house and the country club in that vicinity that&#39;s shown in your picture. And the country club is about 20 -- a 20-minute drive from my parents&#39; home.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>Mitchell: &quot;A 20-minute drive.

(And Mitchell&rsquo;s report is dated Sept. 30, so it could not have been a source for the meme posted on Sept. 29.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, the meme does appear to be correct about the price of a Motorola DynaTAC 8000X in 1984.
