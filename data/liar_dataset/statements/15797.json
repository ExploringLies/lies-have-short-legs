And one of the most common yardsticks politicians use is gross domestic product, which is the sum of all economic activity in a geographical unit, such as a country or a state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a rally in Charleston, W.Va., on Aug. 21, Trump said, &quot;When I came here originally, West Virginia, frankly, was down and out. It was not doing exactly well. One of the last. Do you know that a few months ago, it hit where West Virginia is, on a per capita basis, one of the most successful G.D.P. states in our union?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does he have a point? We took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Looking at quarterly GDP growth</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Trump has claimed success in revitalizing West Virginia&#39;s economy. A little over a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/03/fact-checking-donald-trumps-rally-west-virginia/\">he said</a> at a different rally in the state, &quot;3 percent growth in West Virginia. &hellip; West Virginia, you&rsquo;re leading the average.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/03/fact-checking-donald-trumps-rally-west-virginia/\">PolitiFact</a> found that assertion to be well-grounded. &nbsp;During the first quarter of 2017, West Virginia&rsquo;s economy grew by exactly 3 percent, according to the data available at the time. (This figure was subsequently updated with new data, as is the standard procedure.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the second-fastest rate of any state in the country at the time. It was well above the national average for the first quarter, which was 1.2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as we noted at the time, that was only one quarter&rsquo;s worth of growth. How well has The Mountain State done since then?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a bit of a roller coaster, according to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the figures for annualized GDP growth for West Virginia on Trump&rsquo;s watch. They are the <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2018-08/qgdpstate0718_0.xlsx\">most recent figures available</a>, including updated data for the previous quarters.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Quarter</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Annualized GDP growth for West Virginia</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1st quarter 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>6.6 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2nd quarter 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>-1.1 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>3rd quarter 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>10.2 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>4th quarter 2017</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1.0 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1st quarter 2018</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1.3 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This chart shows that while West Virginia has had some highs in GDP growth during Trump&rsquo;s tenure -- specifically, in the first and third quarters of 2017 -- the state&rsquo;s GDP actually shrank during the second quarter of 2017, and in the most recent two quarters, it has grown only modestly, by 1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, during the most recent quarter for which data is available, West Virginia&rsquo;s growth rate ranked as only the 37th best in the nation. That paints a different picture than the one Trump was offering at the rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Looking at GDP per capita</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s another way to look at Trump&rsquo;s assertion -- to compare gross domestic product per capita for West Virginia to the other states in the union. This statistic is calculated by dividing the state&rsquo;s GDP by the state&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Measuring it this way makes Trump&rsquo;s statement even less accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 2017 -- the most recent full year for which data is available -- West Virginia ranked 47th nationally in GDP per capita, according to the <a href=\"https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/drilldown.cfm?reqid=70&amp;stepnum=11&amp;AreaTypeKeyGdp=1&amp;GeoFipsGdp=XX&amp;ClassKeyGdp=naics&amp;ComponentKey=1000&amp;IndustryKey=1&amp;YearGdp=2017&amp;YearGdpBegin=-1&amp;YearGdpEnd=-1&amp;UnitOfMeasureKeyGdp=levels&amp;RankKeyGdp=1&amp;Drill=1&amp;nRange=5\">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>. The only states that ranked lower were Arkansas, Idaho and Mississippi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll note that economists say presidents don&rsquo;t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;A few months ago, it hit where West Virginia is, on a per capita basis, one of the most successful (gross domestic product) states in our union.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judging by quarterly GDP growth -- a measure Trump has used accurately in the past to talk about West Virginia -- the state chalked up two quarters of rapid growth but three quarters of stagnation. In the most recent two quarters, West Virginia was mired around 1 percent growth, ranking in the bottom half of states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternately, using GDP per capita, Trump is way off, as West Virginia ranks 47th among the states in this measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores evidence that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-31T00:25:45.527760", "ruling_date": "2018-08-31T00:30:34", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump mostly incorrect about W.Va. economic growth", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-mostly-incorrect-about-wva-economic-g", "ruling_link_text": "Recently, growth has been sporadic", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, rally in Charleston, W.Va., Aug. 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Economic Analysis, <a href=\"https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/drilldown.cfm?reqid=70&amp;stepnum=11&amp;AreaTypeKeyGdp=1&amp;GeoFipsGdp=XX&amp;ClassKeyGdp=naics&amp;ComponentKey=1000&amp;IndustryKey=1&amp;YearGdp=2017&amp;YearGdpBegin=-1&amp;YearGdpEnd=-1&amp;UnitOfMeasureKeyGdp=levels&amp;RankKeyGdp=1&amp;Drill=1&amp;nRange=5\">annualized state GDP growth</a>, first quarter 2017 to first quarter 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Economic Analysis, <a href=\"https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/drilldown.cfm?reqid=70&amp;stepnum=11&amp;AreaTypeKeyGdp=1&amp;GeoFipsGdp=XX&amp;ClassKeyGdp=naics&amp;ComponentKey=1000&amp;IndustryKey=1&amp;YearGdp=2017&amp;YearGdpBegin=-1&amp;YearGdpEnd=-1&amp;UnitOfMeasureKeyGdp=levels&amp;RankKeyGdp=1&amp;Drill=1&amp;nRange=5\">GDP per capita</a>, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/trump-fact-check-west-virginia-rally.html\">Trump&rsquo;s False Claims About Coal, the Environment and West Virginia</a>,&quot; Aug. 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/03/fact-checking-donald-trumps-rally-west-virginia/\">Fact-checking Donald Trump&#39;s rally in West Virginia with Gov.
