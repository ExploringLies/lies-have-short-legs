We took a closer look. We found that he actually had mangled his talking point: He meant to talk about how many months of consistent growth there&rsquo;s been, not how fast the pace is. We&rsquo;ll look at both metrics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the current recovery began 69 months ago, we looked at total job gains during the first 69 months of each of the previous recoveries, going back to World War II.

Sinclair agreed that the United States is currently enjoying the &quot;longest string of consistently positive monthly job growth since the payroll employment data we typically rely on began being reported in 1939. The late 1980s comes close, but there was a pesky one-month fall in employment in June 1986. Similarly, in the 1990s, there were a couple of small dips.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s the duration of this recovery -- rather than the rate of growth for job creation -- that has made it impressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simas said job growth in the United States is now at the &quot;fastest pace in this country&#39;s history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He would have been right if he&rsquo;d stuck to the duration of the recovery: At 60 months and counting, it&rsquo;s the longest post-war recovery, though earlier recoveries would have been longer had brief blips not intruded. However, looking at how Simas phrased it on CNN, he&rsquo;s wrong: The current recovery actually ranks second-to-last among post-World War II recoveries when judged by the rate of growth in jobs. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-24T16:20:20.489303", "ruling_date": "2015-03-24T16:35:41", "ruling_headline": "White House aide says job growth now at 'fastest pace in this country's history'", "ruling_headline_slug": "white-house-aide-says-job-growth-now-fastest-pace-", "ruling_link_text": "Garbled talking point", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>David Simas, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4645140?0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> on CNN&rsquo;s <em>New Day</em>, March 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ce\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National)</u></a>,&quot; accessed March&nbsp;18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, March 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist, March 23, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "White House aide", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 3131, "last_name": "Simas", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "david-simas", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Simas_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3131/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/author/David%20Simas"}, "statement": "<p>Job growth in the United States is now at the &quot;fastest pace in this country&#39;s history.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on CNN's \"New Day\"", "statement_date": "2015-03-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
