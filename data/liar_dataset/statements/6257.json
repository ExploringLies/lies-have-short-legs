But Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is taking it further. He warns the law will &quot;hurt everyone.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Obamacare is bad policy that adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people,&quot; he wrote in a July 8 <a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-08/opinion/os-ed-guest-column-rubio-070812-20120706_1_obamacare-individual-mandate-new-taxes\">opinion-editorial </a>in the <em>Orlando Sentinel</em>. &quot;It does not discriminate between rich and poor. It hurts everyone.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered where he got his $800 billion tax total, as well as the validity of the idea that the law does not &quot;discriminate between rich and poor.&quot; So we decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>$800 billion in new taxes?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRubio pulled the figure from a <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12069/hr2.pdf\">2011 report</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. It was commissioned by Republican House Speaker John Boehner to estimate the cost of repealing the health care law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepealing the law would result in $813 billion in lost revenues for the government between 2012 and 2021, the report found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere do those come from? To pay for the overhaul, the federal government created a series of &nbsp;new revenue sources -- some are clearly taxes, some are changes to tax rules -- that include the controversial tax penalty for people who do not have their own health insurance and a tax on indoor tanning. (We looked at more than a dozen revenue sources and whether they were actually taxes in a January <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-has-raised-taxes-19-/\">PolitiFact report</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether each revenue source is technically a tax does not matter to Rubio. Here, he equates all money raised from Americans as a tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, Rubio&rsquo;s number doesn&rsquo;t account for the tax breaks that are in the law, especially the tax credits that some people of modest means will receive to help them buy insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe consulted several experts, who disagreed on the best way to account for the law&rsquo;s tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA couple experts said Rubio&rsquo;s $800 billion figure is valid, even if it is out of date and does not account for billions in tax credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s just stating what the tax bill is,&quot; said Joseph Henchman, of the business-backed Tax Policy Foundation. &quot;Most people don&#39;t expect you to net out benefits.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot so fast, said Chapin White, a former CBO staffer who is now a senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change, a health research group founded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. White said it&rsquo;s important to subtract the law&rsquo;s $519 billion in refundable tax credits and subsidies for health insurance, among other things.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll told, the more appropriate net &quot;tax increase&quot; over 10 years is about $20 billion, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>No difference between rich and poor?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRubio spokesman Alex Conant declined to elaborate on what Rubio meant when he said the law does not &quot;discriminate between rich and poor,&quot; saying he did not want to parse his words.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe best we can infer from Rubio&rsquo;s claim and the context around it is the health care law affects the rich and the poor the same, tax-wise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that&rsquo;s off base.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe point of the law was to expand health coverage to those who don&rsquo;t have it -- including people who don&#39;t have jobs or have low income. To make that happen, the law provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, and it includes more taxes on the wealthy and an individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo of the biggest taxes in the law are geared toward taxpayers with higher incomes. People whose incomes exceed $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) will pay 0.9 percentage point more on Medicare payroll taxes in 2013. These people would also pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlus, the law includes a 40 percent excise tax on people who have high-premium health insurance plans starting in 2018. Also known as &quot;Cadillac plans,&quot; these premiums are usually obtained by people in the middle- to upper- class, and are expected to bring in $111 billion through 2021.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats, of course, take a different view than the Republicans. The Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate Finance Committee released a <a href=\"http://www.finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/release/?id=3864d045-2156-426b-afda-11bad0b69986\">compilation of tax breaks</a> available to individuals, middle-class families, and small businesses, thanks to the law. The total? $828 billion in &quot;tax cuts&quot; over 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost of that comes from tax credits and subsidies for families with low- to moderate-level incomes. The law creates exchanges through which consumers can shop for the best plans. People who qualify can supplement the cost of an insurance plan with a government subsidy, which will be based on income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA break is also extended to certain small businesses with low-income workers who employ fewer than 50 people and offer health insurance to them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow for the individual mandate, which requires most everyone to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou could argue it doesn&rsquo;t discriminate between rich and poor because it applies to most everyone. But the penalty is linked to income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndividuals who go uninsured and who aren&#39;t exempt from the mandate <a href=\"https://www.bcbsri.com/BCBSRIWeb/pdf/Individual_Mandate_Fact_Sheet.pdf\">will have to pay</a> an annual penalty of at least $95 per adult in 2014, rising to $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- 2.5 percent of household income, if that&rsquo;s greater than the amount written into the law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe nonpartisan federal researchers at CBO and JCT <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12033/12-23-selectedhealthcarepublications.pdf\">have estimated</a> that about 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProbably most relevant to our fact-check is the fact that the mandate includes a hardship exemption for people who cannot afford to buy health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRubio cherry-picks the highest number he can find -- $800 billion in new taxes -- to garner opposition to the recently upheld health care law. He doesn&rsquo;t tell readers anything more about the figure, including the fact that these &quot;taxes&quot; would be garnered over 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis statement also indicates that rich and poor people will feel the effects of the law&rsquo;s various revenue-raising provisions with the same degree of pain. But that&rsquo;s not true. The law taxes wealthier Americans to a greater degree to provide more services for the poor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-13T14:28:30.987361", "ruling_date": "2012-07-16T11:04:30", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio says $800 billion in taxes in health care law do not \"discriminate between rich and poor\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-says-taxes-health-care-law-do-not-discrimina", "ruling_link_text": "Very different treatment for rich and poor", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Orlando Sentinel,</em> &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-08/opinion/os-ed-guest-column-rubio-070812-20120706_1_obamacare-individual-mandate-new-taxes\">Marco Rubio: Obamacare&rsquo;s taxes punish individuals, small businesses</a>,&quot; July 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNPR&rsquo;s &quot;Shots&quot; health blog, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/03/22/149164172/answers-to-your-questions-about-the-health-care-overhaul-law\">Answers To Your Questions About The Health Care Overhaul Law</a>,&quot; March 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-has-raised-taxes-19-/\">Mitt Romney says Barack Obama has raised taxes 19 times</a>,&quot; Jan. 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/09/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-75-percent-obamacare-tax-falls-/\">Facebook post says &quot;75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class</a>,&quot; July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-health-care-laws-penalty-tax/\">Mitt Romney says health care law&rsquo;s penalty is a tax</a>,&quot; July 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interviews with Alex Conant, Rubio spokesman, July 9-10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Nick Papas, White House spokesman, July 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12069/hr2.pdf\">Analysis</a> of implementing H.R. 2, the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act, Feb. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Joseph Henchman, Tax Policy Foundation vice president of legal and state projects, July 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Foundation blog, &quot;<a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/blog/taxing-uninsured\">Taxing the Uninsured</a>,&quot; June 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Chapin White, senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change, July 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Senate Committee on Finance, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/release/?id=3864d045-2156-426b-afda-11bad0b69986\">The Affordable Care Act: More than $800 billion in tax cuts</a>,&quot; June 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, &quot;<a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=301425\">Supreme Court&#39;s Health Law Decision Leaves in Place 21 Tax Hikes Costing Taxpayers More Than $675 Billion</a>,&quot; June 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJoint Committee on Taxation, <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/JCT_June_2012_Partial_Re-estimate_of_Tax_Provisions_in_ACA.pdf\">memo</a> providing estimates for repealing the health care law, June 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Joseph Rosenberg, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center research associate, July 11, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 36, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Marco", "half_true_count": 33, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 277, "last_name": "Rubio", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "marco-rubio", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Marco_Rubio.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/277/", "total_count": 168, "true_count": 20, "website": "http://www.rubio.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe health care law &quot;adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people.
