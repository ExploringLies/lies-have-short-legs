Scott Walker has used Wisconsin&rsquo;s southerly neighbor as a punching bag, hitting Illinois for trying to tax its way out of a big deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIllinois Gov. Pat Quinn volleyed back when Walker crossed the border for an April 17, 2012 <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/147753025.html\">speech in Springfield</a> to tout his record -- and troll for businesses looking to relocate -- at the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a campaign fundraising email, Quinn bashed Wisconsin&rsquo;s last-in-the nation record on job creation in 2011 and tried to poke holes in Walker&rsquo;s record on taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You might have heard that the Illinois Chamber of Commerce hosted Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker as guest speaker today,&quot; <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Quinn.doc\">the email said</a>. &quot;One would wonder what a governor with a terrible economic record could have to say about jobs and economic growth. While Governor Walker might be fond of anti-worker and tea party rhetoric, the facts aren&#39;t on his side.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tQuinn&rsquo;s hit list ended with this:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Governor Walker&#39;s budget increases state spending by over $1 billion, which is primarily paid for by tax increases on seniors, families with children, and home owners. His budget calls for raising property taxes by nearly &hellip; $500 billion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/20/sandy-pasch/wisconsin-rep-sandy-pasch-says-sen-alberta-darling/\">earlier item</a> we confirmed that Walker signed a two-year budget that raised spending by more than $1 billion, a 1.8% increase over the biennium. Most of the increase was in Medicaid programs, which are entitlements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut did the budget lead to $500 billion in property tax increases? Hasn&rsquo;t Walker been touting a property tax freeze?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRight out of the gate we found a problem with Quinn&rsquo;s number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe day after Quinn&rsquo;s email, we asked his campaign about the figure. Five days later we were told it was a typo that was being corrected. They meant $500 million, not billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy that time, the higher figure has been reprinted in a <a href=\"http://www.rrstar.com/insight/x304762865/Our-View-In-Illinois-versus-Wisconsin-Land-of-Lincoln-has-a-lot-going-for-it\">Rockford newspaper editorial</a> and on political <a href=\"http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Quinn-To-Walker-I-Know-You-Are-But-What-Am-I-147920895.html\">blogs</a> in <a href=\"http://thepoliticalenvironment.blogspot.com/2012/04/illinois-gov-quinn-responds-to-walkers.html\">both states</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott Belsky, executive director of Quinn&rsquo;s campaign organization, subsequently told us the exact figure they are referring to is $483.8 million. The figure, he said, is from Walker&rsquo;s cut in two tax credits for low-income homeowners and working families, plus &quot;increasing taxes on local levels of government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSure enough, that number or <a href=\"http://www.wisdems.org/news/blog/view/2011-06-top-ten-worst-items-in-scott-walkers-radical-budget\">something close to it</a> was <a href=\"http://wisconsinwave.org/news/mark-pocan-state-budget-taxes-poor-gives-rich\">cited by various Democrats</a> after <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/124563073.html\">Walker signed the budget </a>in June 2011. They did their math using <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2011-13-Budget/Documents/2011_07_05%20property%20tax%20estimates.pdf\">estimates published </a>in July 2011 by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a great source, but the Fiscal Bureau report didn&rsquo;t actually use the $483.8 million number in <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/119928064.html\">estimating the total property tax increase</a> for two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFiscal Bureau official Rick Olin said their estimate is better stated as $338 million -- that comes from a comparison of estimated 2012 tax levies with the pre-Walker base year of 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoing for the worst-sounding math (just as Republicans have done in the past), Democrats took the estimates for each of the two Walker years and compared them to the 2010 base.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Nobody thinks about it that way,&quot; said Olin, a fiscal analyst on property taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about the two tax credits Quinn&rsquo;s campaign cites?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne was for income taxes, so that&rsquo;s irrelevant to his claim on property taxes. The other Walker change, on the Homestead credit, did in effect raise property taxes by $13.6 million, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2011-13-Budget/Documents/2011_07_05%20Tax%20and%20Fee%20Act%2032.pdf\">state fiscal estimates</a> show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo take the $338 million and the $13.6 million and you&rsquo;re at more than a $350 million increase predicted under Walker&rsquo;s budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there&rsquo;s a much bigger problem for Quinn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers were Fiscal Bureau estimates from about nine months ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn April 16, 2012, the day before <a href=\"http://www.quinnforillinois.com/\">Quinn&rsquo;s campaign</a> rolled out the <a href=\"http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2012/04/quinn-unwelcomes-wisconsin-gov.html\">unwelcome mat</a> for Walker, the Wisconsin governor <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47059460/ns/local_news-milwaukee_wi/t/walker-says-property-tax-bills-wisconsin-smaller\">announced hard data</a> on what local governments actually raised property taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe net levy increase was $21 million (0.2 percent) in year one -- far, far lower than the Fiscal Bureau projection.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the owner of a median-valued home actually saw a slight decrease on the property tax bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA big reason was the tightened revenue caps Walker and GOP legislators slapped on localities -- creating a virtual tax freeze, with an exception increases tied to new construction. Fewer communities than expected used even the little wiggle room Walker gave them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, while Quinn&rsquo;s email blamed Walker for property tax decisions made by local officials, the record shows Walker actually sought aggressive controls on local increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tQuinn said his Wisconsin counterpart had increased property taxes nearly $500 billion. That was explained as an old-fashioned typo. But even then, the $500 million is way off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Walker signed the budget in June 2011, property taxes were estimated to go up $350 million under the most common accounting. That estimate held until the April 16, 2012 report -- and it seems likely Quinn&rsquo;s email was prepared before Walker&rsquo;s announcement changed the game.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he didn&rsquo;t correct the million/billion typo in a timely way, and is still using the equally wrong $500 million claim. We think that&rsquo;s ridiculous.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that makes this a Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-was-there-a-5-billion-property-tax-increase-op56nbq-149487225.html\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s web page</a>)</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-27T18:49:00.559552", "ruling_date": "2012-04-30T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Illinois Gov.
