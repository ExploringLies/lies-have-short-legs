The plans, the story said, were announced by the Austin Parks Foundation, which was described as intending to award the money as grants.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Half of it will be spent on improving smaller parks in the Barton Hills, Zilker, Bouldin Creek, Old West Austin, West Austin and Rollingwood neighborhoods,&quot; the story said, with the remaining $150,000 devoted to the park&rsquo;s irrigation system.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSpread $150,000 evenly among six neighborhoods and it comes to $25,000 each.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s indirect guidance; we sought definitive evidence. By email, Bone guided us to Abel Campos, a city accountant, who emailed us a <u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGVV9fdzA5Z3EzOEk/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">copy</a></u> of a $25,000 check, dated Jan. 12, 2007, made out to the city by the parks foundation. Campos also shared a March 20, 2007, letter to the city from Charlie McCabe, then the foundation&#39;s executive director, stating the money reflected proceeds from the Rolling Stones concert.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBone said the Rolling Stones gave $25,000 to Rollingwood after the band performed at Zilker Park. That&rsquo;s the amount of money that flowed through the Austin Parks Foundation to the city described as proceeds from the big show. We rate the statement as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-17T16:16:00.344186", "ruling_date": "2013-06-17T15:38:54", "ruling_headline": "Rollingwood mayor says Rolling Stones donated $25,000 to city for inconvenience of Zilker Park concert", "ruling_headline_slug": "rollingwood-mayor-says-rolling-stones-donated-2500", "ruling_link_text": "Hearts of Stones", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNews story, &quot;Stones pay to the tune of $300,000,&quot; <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, Feb. 8, 2007</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGVV9fdzA5Z3EzOEk/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Documents</a></u>, $25,000 check to City of Rollingwood from Austin Parks Foundation, deposit receipt and letter from foundation to city, January and March 2007 (received by email from Abel Campos, accountant, City of Rollingwood, June 17, 2013)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Businessman", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Barry", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 2340, "last_name": "Bone", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "barry-bone", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/barrybonepft.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2340/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://cityofrollingwood.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=82%3Acurrent-council&catid=37%3Acouncil&Itemid=70&lang=en"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays that when the Rolling Stones performed in an Austin park, they paid $25,000 to the nearby city of Rollingwood &quot;for one night of inconvenience.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an opinion column in the Westlake Picayune.", "statement_date": "2013-06-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 203, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/203/", "subject": "City Government", "subject_slug": "city-government", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 100, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/100/", "subject": "Recreation", "subject_slug": "recreation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
