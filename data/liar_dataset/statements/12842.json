It accuses the senator of voting against Planned Parenthood, being against a woman&rsquo;s right to choose and supporting the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In one segment, Majority Forward, which bills itself as an organization with a goal of increasing voter registration and turnout and is associated with the pro-Democrat Senate Majority PAC, claims Toomey &quot;even tried to shut down the federal government in order to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood was a major point of contention last year, and Toomey has long been an opponent of the organization. But did Toomey really try to shut down the federal government?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dispute over Planned Parenthood peaked last September after a series of undercover videos of its executives and technicians discussing aborted fetuses had been released by the Center for Medical Progress. House and Senate Republicans, primarily Tea Party figures, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/planned-parenthood-videos-shutdown-carly-fiorina-2015-9\">responded</a> by calling for Congress to defund the organization. The debate caused complications as legislators worked toward a spending deal needed to keep many government programs running. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood gets <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/01/planned_parenthood_funding_cut.html\">about $450 million each year</a> in federal funds, mostly out of funding from Medicare and Medicaid. On September 24, the Senate <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/254819-senate-rejects-effort-to-defund-planned-parenthood\">voted on a spending bill</a> containing language to defund Planned Parenthood. Toomey was one of 47 senators who voted in favor of the bill -- not enough for it to pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 30, the day before the deadline for the government shutdown, the Senate passed a spending deal that didn&rsquo;t contain language to defund Planned Parenthood. Toomey was one of 20 senators to vote no <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00272\">on the final bill</a>, compared to 78 senators who voted yes. This came about a week after Toomey<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/these-gop-senators-are-not-happy-about-shutdown.html#\"> told New York magazine</a> he didn&rsquo;t think it was a good idea to cause a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A government shutdown was a possible result if the bill did not pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He voted against the continuing resolution that funded Planned Parenthood and the government,&quot; said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown&rsquo;s Government Affairs Institute. &quot;Whether he was threatening to shut down the government may be rhetorical.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, after Toomey voted against the spending plan, he released a statement saying, &quot;I have strongly supported efforts to permanently stop government shutdowns. Shutdowns are no way to conduct the nation&rsquo;s business....It is now apparent that the government will not shut down, so the question before the Senate is whether taxpayers should be forced to fund Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s outrageous extremist practices. I voted against that, and I am instead in favor of shifting Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s funding over to health centers that provide essential services to women in need.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toomey&rsquo;s campaign condemned the Majority Forward ad, saying the PAC was lying and said Toomey has fought to end government shutdowns. Majority Forward did not respond to a request for comment. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Republicans calling to defund Planned Parenthood last year, a federal spending plan was pushed to the brink. Had a plan not passed before Oct. 1, the government would have shut down like it did in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 30, a few days after voting for a failed spending bill that would have defunded Planned Parenthood, Senator Pat Toomey voted no on a final spending bill overwhelmingly approved by the Senate. So Toomey voted against a bill that averted a government shutdown. By doing so, he didn&rsquo;t do the same thing as try to &quot;shut down the government,&quot; as Majority Forward claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-02T10:54:51.257091", "ruling_date": "2016-08-02T10:53:54", "ruling_headline": "Attacking Pat Toomey: Did he try to shut down government over Planned Parenthood?", "ruling_headline_slug": "attacking-pat-toomey-did-he-try-shut-down-governme", "ruling_link_text": "A vote does not equal a shutdown attempt", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/planned-parenthood-videos-shutdown-carly-fiorina-2015-9\">A lot of Republicans want to shut down the government over 10 &lsquo;undercover&rsquo; videos</a>,&quot;&nbsp;<em>Business Insider</em>, September 20, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/these-gop-senators-are-not-happy-about-shutdown.html#\">GOP Senators up for re-election are not happy about a potential shutdown</a>,&quot;&nbsp;<em>New York</em>, September 23, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=1cc3abb6-2b2d-4dbc-98e9-b26bfe626c36\">Majority Forward Political Ad</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/01/planned_parenthood_funding_cut.html\">Planned Parenthood funding cut by $450M in proposed GOP bill</a>,&quot; Associated Press, January 6, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roll Call Vote,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00272\">H.R. 719</a>, September 30, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement, Pat Toomey campaign, September 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement, Pat Toomey campaign, August 1, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/capitolinq/Toomey-against-bill-that-would-avert-shutdown.html\">Toomey votes against bill that would avert shutdown</a>,&quot;&nbsp;<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, September 29, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/us/with-possible-shutdown-nearing-obama-looks-to-take-budget-fight-to-gop.html\">With possible shutdown nearing, Obama looks to take budget fight to GOP</a>,&quot;&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>, September 16, 2015.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Majority", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3631, "last_name": "Forward", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "majority-forward", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Pennsylvania", "edition": "Pennsylvania", "edition_slug": "pennsylvania", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 54, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Pennsylvania Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/54/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3631/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Sen.
