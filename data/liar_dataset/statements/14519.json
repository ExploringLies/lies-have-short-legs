It may or may not happen, but the thought of it occurring on a widespread attack on groceries could be terrorizing,&quot; said the <a href=\"http://freedomdaily.com/muslims-plan-grocery-stores-bare-irma/\">post</a> about the grocery stores. &quot;People could even entertain the thought of an ISIS attack before a hurricane in which the food is all poisoned and people falter in the midst of a category 4 storm before the storm even hits them. Of course, this is not something that has happened, but a mere idea or spectacle that theorists could allege.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SITE Intelligence Group <a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Chatter/is-supporters-distribute-english-message-suggesting-to-poison-food-in-markets.html\">reported</a> on Sept. 3 that potential terrorists were advised to inject food sold at markets with cyanide poison. SITE said that message was distributed Sept. 3 on a pro-Islamic State channel on the social media platform Telegram and that it was part of a series of information promoting &quot;lone-wolf jihad in Western countries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freedom Daily linked to a Sept. 6 <a href=\"http://thefederalistpapers.org/us/isis-new-tactic-poison-grocery-food\">story</a> on The Federalist Papers Project based on SITE&rsquo;s report. Newsweek also published a <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/isis-supporters-call-poisoning-grocery-stores-us-and-europe-660750\">story</a> Sept. 7 headlined, &quot;ISIS supporters call for poisoning of food in grocery stores across U.S. and Europe.&quot; But neither of them say the information came after people emptied shelves at stores as they prepared for Hurricane Irma&rsquo;s path across the Caribbean and Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freedom Daily&rsquo;s story uses a photo of a woman in a blue blouse pushing a shopping cart past empty shelves in a grocery store.
