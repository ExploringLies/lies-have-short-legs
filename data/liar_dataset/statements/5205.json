I didn&#39;t inherit money from my parents. What I have, I earned. I worked hard, the American way.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were curious. Did Romney, the last of George and Lenore&#39;s four children, receive no inheritance on his path to wealth?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Romney&#39;s words</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked Romney&#39;s campaign about his claim.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&quot;Mitt Romney&#39;s success is based on his 25-year career in business and the fact that he founded and led one of the most successful private equity companies in the world,&quot; spokesman Ryan Williams said.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThat wasn&#39;t as helpful as, say, a copy of his father&#39;s will.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tNor was there any information about George Romney&#39;s financial legacy in the many obituaries for the Michigan luminary, who died in 1995 at age 88.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tBut Mitt Romney has addressed the question himself, it turns out, in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1066\">an interview with C-SPAN</a>&nbsp;in 2006. Host Brian Lamb asked him why his father hadn&#39;t given him an inheritance.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tRomney answered, &quot;Well, he didn&rsquo;t have as much as I think some people anticipated. And I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn&rsquo;t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that&rsquo;s where his inheritance ended up.&quot;</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/newsletters/Fall2004.pdf\">a short history</a>&nbsp;of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney&#39;s death.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, in Romney&#39;s own words, he did &quot;inherit some funds&quot; from his dad. But he gave them away.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I figured we had enough of our own,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe probably did. By 1995, Romney had already led Bain Capital for more than a decade, where shrewd investments made him millions. He stepped down in 1999.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/king-bain-video-accuses-romney-hiding-his-fortune/\">now says he&#39;s worth</a>&nbsp;somewhere between $190 million and $250 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>How Romney got rich</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I went off on my own,&quot; Romney said at the debate. &quot;... What I have I earned. I worked hard, the American way.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while he didn&#39;t ultimately benefit from an inheritance, we wondered: Had Romney&#39;s parents&#39; wealth helped build his own fortune?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s no evidence we saw that Romney&#39;s parents helped buy him a business career. But there were certain advantages to Romney&#39;s comfortable upbringing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRomney started college at Stanford, where his &quot;allowance&quot; was big enough for frequent plane tickets to sneak home to Michigan see his girlfriend, Ann, according to a recently published book by two <em>Boston Globe</em> journalists, &quot;<em><a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780062123275\">The Real Romney</a></em>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter a two-year missionary trip to France, where he lived sparely as he proselytized door-to-door, he finished his undergraduate studies at BYU, where he married Ann in 1969. He was 22, his wife 19. His parents&#39; wedding gift? A car. Meanwhile, the students &mdash; who started a family a year later &mdash; lived in a modest, $62-a-month basement apartment, Ann later told the <em>Boston Globe</em>. But they didn&#39;t have to work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We were happy, studying hard. Neither one of us had a job, because Mitt had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the couple moved to Boston so Romney could study business and law at Harvard, his parents helped them buy a house.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s not clear who paid for his education, but Romney wasn&#39;t exactly a struggling student: enough cash for plane tickets, a car as a wedding gift, stock that kept him from having to work, help buying a home.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about that hard work he mentioned?</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tWhen he got back from his mission trip to France, he wanted to &quot;accomplish things of significance,&quot; according to a quote from <em>The Real Romney</em>.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I said, &#39;Boy, I want to do something with my life if I can.&#39; So when I came home, I was a much better student.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt BYU, he graduated with highest honors and gave a speech at graduation. He got accepted to a recently created dual-degree program in law and business at Harvard.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf hundreds of Romney&#39;s law and business school classmates at Harvard, just 15 earned the dual degree &mdash; which packed courses required for the two degrees into less time than earning them separately. Romney didn&#39;t just earn the degree. He graduated with honors from the law school and in the top 5 percent of his class in the business school, according to <em>The Real Romney.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis mere presence among the elite MBA/JD earners got him heavily recruited by Boston Consulting Group. So while he passed the Michigan bar in case he needed to go back to his dad&#39;s state to work near the car industry, it wouldn&#39;t be necessary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;(Romney) was an outstanding recruit with exceptional grades, and he was the very charming, smooth, attractive son of a former presidential candidate. So everybody was bending over backward to get their hands on him,&quot; said Charles Faris, who was with Boston Consulting Group, according to the <em>The Real Romney</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen he started work with Boston Consulting Group, &quot;he worked his butt off,&quot; Faris said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe young father worked nights, weekends and traveled often, including frequent trips to Europe, the book says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe got hired away by Bill Bain at consulting company Bain &amp; Co., who ultimately tapped him to launch Bain Capital in 1984.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere, he made the deals that dramatically increased his wealth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tMitt Romney, making the case that he made his own wealth, said, &quot;I didn&#39;t inherit money from my parents.&quot;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tIndeed, he was already a wealthy man by the time his father, George, died in 1995. He did receive an inheritance but says he gave it away. We don&#39;t have independent confirmation of that. But a family-funded endowment at BYU started in 1998 to support the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management, bolstering Romney&#39;s claim.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tDid Romney&#39;s career benefit from having well-to-do parents? It certainly eased his way, with their financial help allowing him to focus on his studies. But there&#39;s good evidence he also worked hard to make his own success, graduating with honors at BYU and Harvard, and building a reputation at Boston Consulting Group and Bain that ultimately catapulted him to wealth.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tRomney wasn&#39;t entirely clear about the inheritance he gave away when he said he &quot;didn&#39;t inherit money&quot; from his parents. But he&#39;s right that such a gift wasn&#39;t key to his success. We rate his claim Half True.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<strong><em>CORRECTION: </em></strong><em>An earlier version of this item gave the wrong decade for George Romney&#39;s presidential run.
