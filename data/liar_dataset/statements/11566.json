The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we&#39;ve created something called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that&#39;s digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud. This is how socialism starts, ladies and gentlemen. We must take our government back.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered: Was Fiorina right that, unlike other federal regulatory agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has &quot;no congressional oversight&quot;? We took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An unusual structure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, some background on the bureau. Its <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/the-bureau/\">mission</a> is to &quot;protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws.&quot; This includes enforcing consumer financial protection laws, following up on consumer complaints, promoting financial education, conducting research on consumer behavior, and monitoring financial markets for risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New agencies that seek to police well-established industries are often controversial, and the bureau is no different. Its champion was Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon who was considered the likely first head of the bureau until her appointment was effectively blocked by Republicans in Congress. Obama&rsquo;s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a controversial recess appointment. Cordray was ultimately confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (The bureau declined to comment for this story. We did not hear back from Fiorina&rsquo;s campaign.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina has a point that by Washington standards, the bureau is unusually unfettered by oversight, congressional and otherwise -- something specifically designed to limit any influence by the financial sector it oversees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the clearest example of this long leash is that, unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. That means that Congress doesn&rsquo;t approve the bureau&rsquo;s budget every year. Instead, the bureau&rsquo;s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve, currently capped at 12 percent of the Fed&rsquo;s total operating expenses. This works out to about $600 million a year today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who are skeptical of the bureau say that seriously hampers Congress&rsquo; oversight ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Oversight without any budget leverage has turned out to be completely hollow,&quot; said Todd J. Zywicki, executive director of the George Mason Law and Economics Center at George Mason University and a <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/06/30/congress-takes-steps-to-keep-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-in-line\">frequent commentator on the issue</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brenden D. Soucy, a Miami-based lawyer, wrote an <a href=\"http://archive.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/backissues/vol40/documents/soucy.pdf\">article</a> critical of the the bureau&rsquo;s degree of congressional oversight in the Florida State University Law Review in 2013. He called the bureau &quot;the most independent agency in United States history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The CFPB&rsquo;s extreme independence is touted as one of its greatest virtues, but history has shown that while independence from political pressure can be a virtue, near total isolation is not,&quot; Soucy wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Congress does have some levers of influence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that Congress lacks an important -- and perhaps the most important -- lever for allowing lawmakers to oversee and guide the agency. But does that really equal &quot;no congressional oversight&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not really. Here are a number of ways in which Congress can oversee the bureau:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Congress can use legislation to change (or even abolish) the bureau. Indeed, there&rsquo;s currently <a href=\"http://www.acainternational.org/governmentaffairs-us-senator-introduces-legislation-to-provide-congressional-oversight-of-cfpb-36007.aspx\">legislation</a> in <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/06/30/congress-takes-steps-to-keep-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-in-line\">both chambers</a> to enshrine a variety of transparency standards, some of which passed the House Financial Services Committee with bipartisan backing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The Senate must confirm the head of the bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The board&rsquo;s director must testify at least twice a year before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; the House Financial Services Committee; and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bureau must also submit semi-annual budget justifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The bureau is subject to an annual financial audit by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combined with other checks and balances by other parts of the executive branch and the judicial branch, this is a list of oversight mechanisms &quot;that will measure up against any regulatory agency in Washington,&quot; Warren, the bureau&rsquo;s patron saint, wrote in an October 2015 <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-warren/banking-industrys-attempt-weaken-cfpb_b_8340792.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\">op-ed</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other experts in government regulation and oversight don&rsquo;t go this far -- but they add that Fiorina&rsquo;s characterization is an exaggeration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;The CFPB has a lot longer leash that almost any other federal agency,&quot; said Donald F. Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But, he added, &quot;Congress did it on purpose. Congress can change it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Soucy, the lawyer who wrote critically of the lack of congressional oversight, agreed that Fiorina went too far with this statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While the CFPB is nearly completely free of congressional oversight, it is not true to say that it has &lsquo;no&rsquo; congressional oversight,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has &quot;no congressional oversight.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has a point that where the bureau is concerned, lawmakers lack one of their strongest levers of influence -- the power of the purse. This makes it reasonable to say that the bureau has an unusually low amount of congressional oversight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, &quot;low&quot; does not equal &quot;none.&quot; Lawmakers are already flexing their muscles by advancing laws that would stiffen the bureau&rsquo;s transparency rules, and the bureau&rsquo;s Senate-confirmed director must testify and provide financial documentation at least twice a year to three separate congressional committees. The bureau must also be audited annually by an arm of Congress, the Government Accountability Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script src=\"http://www.politifact.com/media/js/politifactwidget5.js\"></script></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-12T16:37:01.606241", "ruling_date": "2015-11-14T20:33:46", "ruling_headline": "Carly Fiorina says Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has 'no congressional oversight'", "ruling_headline_slug": "carly-fiorina-says-consumer-financial-protection-b", "ruling_link_text": "Unusually little, but not none", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Carly Fiorina, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4788898?15\">comments at the Republican presidential debate</a>, Nov. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42572.pdf\">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB): A Legal Analysis</a>,&quot; January 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Todd Zywicki and Chad Reese, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/06/30/congress-takes-steps-to-keep-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-in-line\">Redundant Today, Essential Tomorrow</a>&quot; (op-ed), June 30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brenden D.
