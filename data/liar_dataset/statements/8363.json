Gov. David Dewhurst have been making a meal out of an incident during Texas Senate debate on tightening abortion clinic regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example: In an <a href=\"http://kfyo.com/texas-agriculture-commissioner-todd-staples-says-border-security-is-major-part-of-plan-for-lieutenant-governor-campaign-auido/\"><u>interview</u></a> Aug. 29, 2013, on Lubbock&rsquo;s KFYO-AM, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples said, &quot;The current incumbent lieutenant governor went out for drinks during the legislative session when that bill was originally on the Senate floor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staples made clear in the interview that that he wasn&rsquo;t referring to the night Sen. Wendy Davis filibustered abortion restrictions, June 25-26, 2013, but to earlier debate over the same measure, <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=831&amp;Bill=SB5\"><u>Senate Bill 5</u></a>, in the first summer special session called by Gov. Rick Perry. Under Democratic fire, the proposal perished in that session, but it passed into law in a second session called by Perry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all versions of the claim about Dewhurst&rsquo;s whereabouts have been so clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a website <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2013/08/dan-patrick-engages-in-gif-cat-warfare/\"><u>launched</u></a> Aug. 16, 2013, by Sen.

In between, he stepped out for a time -- newspapers reported that tweets placed him at a steakhouse eight blocks from the Capitol -- and he confirmed to reporters when he returned that he&rsquo;d been at <a href=\"http://alcsteaks.com/\"><u>Austin Land and Cattle</u></a>. &quot;No steak,&quot; though, he said, and did not answer a question about whether he&rsquo;d had any wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reporters and lege-watchers registered surprise that Dewhurst would depart during debate on an issue he had urged Perry to add to the agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staples campaign spokesman Kent Sholars <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gOkSjLLKhIkYib1CaV7Kn1YyPkXfKKo9nVtejlcaSkc/edit\"><u>emailed us</u></a> the <em>Morning News</em> blog post and a June 24, 2013, <em>San Antonio Express News/Houston Chronicle</em> <a href=\"http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Dewhurst-s-absence-at-debate-gives-fuel-to-critics-4617770.php\"><u>news story</u></a>.

Sholars noted that the <em>Morning News</em> blog post said Dewhurst had decided &quot;to slip out for a glass of wine.&quot; The blog entry didn&rsquo;t cite a source for that statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the reports said that at the restaurant, Dewhurst met up with political consultant Rob Johnson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tried to contact Johnson but did not hear back. He was Dewhurst&rsquo;s chief of staff <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/tribpedia/rob-johnson/about/\"><u>from 2006</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.rickperry.org/release/gov-perry-names-rob-johnson-campaign-manager\"><u>to mid-2009</u></a>, when he became manager of Perry&rsquo;s re-election campaign, then managed presidential campaigns for Newt Gingrich and Perry before <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2012/02/07/perry-campaign-manager-head-dewhurst-super-pac/\"><u>starting</u></a> a political action committee to boost Dewhurst&rsquo;s U.S. Senate bid in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Morning News </em>also reported, &quot;Dewhurst didn&rsquo;t eat. As his spokesman Travis Considine noted two days later, he presided over most of the debate and was confident colleagues could soldier on during his brief absence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate journals for June 18, 2013, show Dewhurst had <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/831/pdf/83S106-18-F1.pdf\"><u>earlier presided</u></a> over the floor proceedings from 12:20 p.m. to 1:39 p.m., then gaveled the Senate back in at 5:39 p.m. to take up the abortion-restriction measure. Dewhurst called for a break at 8:54 p.m., according to the journal, and Sen. Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, took over the duties of presiding from Dewhurst as debate resumed at 9:15 p.m. The Senate adjourned at 10:15 p.m. and was called to order again <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/831/pdf/83S106-18-F.pdf\"><u>by Dewhurst</u></a> at 11:09 p.m. After <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/senate-oks-abortion-measure-in-late-vote/nYPPb/\"><u>voting to approve</u></a> the measure, the Senate called it a night at 11:45 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among tweets collected in a Statesman politics <a href=\"http://mo.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/firstreading/entries/2013/06/19/\"><u>blog post</u></a> June 19, 2013, Associated Press Capitol reporter Jim Vertuno wrote, &quot;Since everyone (is) wondering, Dewhurst is back in the chamber. He was here for 3 hours of debate, let Eltife chair most amendments.&quot; Also during the debate, <em>Express-News</em> reporter Peggy Fikac <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pfikac/status/347193881219190785\"><u>tweeted</u></a>, &quot;Re Land &amp; Cattle, @DavidHDewhurst confirms he was there to say hi to a consultant but &lsquo;no steak.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c2F4oB5SsyJegzVwJB2nUughw394K0bDyaHi-8iP1W_yhcFTzYTwRLLThrzP_zkREgif0XOcnY5siQMipX82FdOBIjrW1JXQFyxG3H_0Qzhnxln4SbFjm1MadA\" style=\"height:128px; width:299px\" /><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/85anQc1T0LFR_Q50lRCpcoRdMRC7paxa03Pg1zeDMS15XbBp7_Uh4_1qVIVZgbkHb3DZZbK4xaRVMPwcnHdJvQllxBgBAwM83KeaOqi0HDufaIVWnWGdGNgr7g\" style=\"height:127px; width:301px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staples said, &quot;The current incumbent lieutenant governor went out for drinks during the legislative session when that bill was originally on the Senate floor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst has said that he stepped out to a restaurant during part of a lengthy Senate debate on abortion legislation June 18.
