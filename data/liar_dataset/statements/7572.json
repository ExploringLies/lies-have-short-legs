Chris Christie, disputed the value of comparing rates. He said the state looks at a business survey to get a broader picture of unemployment, while the BLS uses a monthly household survey to assess unemployment and determine the rate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;What jobs were added, where were jobs added, in what sectors,&quot; Roberts said about the business survey. &quot;You can drill down and get a much better composite picture of what&rsquo;s happening in the state, rather than the unemployment rate.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNow let&rsquo;s look at Buono&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in February 2010. It briefly climbed to 9.9 percent but then trended downward, lingering at 9 percent for six months of 2011. By February of this year it had fallen to 7.7 percent. So Buono is right that the U.S. unemployment rate has declined steadily.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNext, is New Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate nearly 2 percent higher than the nation&rsquo;s? It is, but only since about July 2012, according to BLS data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFinally, how does New Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate stack up against Connecticut&rsquo;s and New York&rsquo;s?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBuono for Governor spokesman David Turner said Buono&rsquo;s remarks cover the timeframe that Christie has been in office. Accordingly, we reviewed BLS data going back to February 2010 &ndash; Christie&rsquo;s first full month in office.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBLS data shows that New Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate was at least 1 percent higher than Connecticut&rsquo;s rate throughout 2012 and this past January.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate was 1 percent higher than New York&rsquo;s for a 22-month period from February 2010 to this past January.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s a breakdown of unemployment rates for the three states:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s rate was 9.7 percent in February 2010 and 9.5 percent this past January.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tConnecticut&rsquo;s was 9.2 percent in February 2010 and 8.1 percent in January.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNew York&rsquo;s was 8.1 percent in February 2010 and 8.4 percent in January.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn response to unemployment numbers released in January by the state Department of Labor, Buono said, &quot;While the United States has seen its unemployment rate steadily decline, New Jersey&rsquo;s remains nearly two percent higher than the national average and more than a point higher than Connecticut and New York.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBuono has varying degrees of accuracy on her three points, looking strictly at unemployment rate: the national unemployment rate has declined steadily while Christie&rsquo;s been governor; the country&rsquo;s unemployment rate has been nearly 2 percent below New Jersey&rsquo;s, but only for about six months; and New Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate has been more than 1 percent higher than New York&rsquo;s and Connecticut&rsquo;s for the bulk of the time Christie has been in office.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tGiven the varying degrees of accuracy, as well as the state measuring unemployment differently from the BLS, we rate Buono&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/politifact_nj_barbara_buono_co.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-27T17:12:05.883057", "ruling_date": "2013-03-28T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Barbara Buono claims New Jersey unemployment ranks higher than national average, 2 other states", "ruling_headline_slug": "barbara-buono-claims-new-jersey-unemployment-ranks", "ruling_link_text": "Nation, other states seem to be doing better", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.15159139597770632\">\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, Jobless rate steady despite 2,600 hires, March 19, 2013, accessed March 26, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website unemployment data tables for nation, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York, accessed March 26, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPhone interview with Stacey Standish, spokeswoman, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 26, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPhone and e-mail interviews with Kevin Roberts, spokesman, Gov.
