Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, spoke up Jan. 12, 2017 in a <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/dairy-pride-act\">news release</a> lauding herself as somebody who &quot;stands up for Wisconsin dairy farmers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin wants Congress to pass the Dairy PRIDE Act -- officially known (at least to a few) as the &quot;Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After two years of falling milk prices, she and <a href=\"http://www.nmpf.org/files/Welch-Simpson%20Letter.pdf\">other federal lawmakers </a>want the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enforce consumer regulations defining &quot;milk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Baldwin right that imitation dairy products -- for instance, soy milk -- often differ nutritionally from dairy item? And is labeling them &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;cheese&quot; or &quot;yogurt&quot; against the law?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back that up, Baldwin&rsquo;s office pointed us to nutritional labels, and to FDA regulations that plainly state: &quot;Milk is the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;Against the law&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To dairy officials, inclusion of the word &quot;milk&quot; on non-dairy products is a misappropriation of the popularity of cow&rsquo;s milk. But competitors say coconut milk and soy milk have long histories and aren&rsquo;t confused with dairy. What&rsquo;s more, they note, the FDA doesn&rsquo;t punish &quot;peanut butter&quot; for using the dairy term &quot;butter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the FDA in 2008 and 2012 did tell two makers of drinks labeled &quot;soy milk&quot; that under its regulations, such labeling was inappropriate because the products did not contain &quot;milk&quot; as defined by the agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Soy drink&quot; or &quot;Soy beverage&quot; would be better, the agency said at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That -- and regulatory language allowing the FDA to declare a product misbranded and try to block its sale -- help Baldwin&rsquo;s case. Federal regulations are part of the United States Code that is the law of the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to the frustration of the dairy industry, the agency has not consistently enforced that line of reasoning, allowing use of &quot;soy milk&quot; and &quot;almond milk&quot; and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rebecca Cross, a San Francisco-based regulatory lawyer for food product companies, said the FDA may be viewing labels on a case-by-case basis and allowing use of dairy terms on plant-based products so long as the use is not misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan Beaver, a food and drug lawyer with Foley &amp; Lardner in Washington, D.C., explained that foods such as soy milk that have no FDA-written <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b22a68a27a372cf330796646d8c68ae9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se21.2.133_13&amp;rgn=div8\">&quot;standard of identity&quot;</a> must choose a &quot;common or usual&quot; name for their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courts, though, have jurisdiction over disputes on the issue and therefore get final say on the meaning of the FDA rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On milk, courts so far have found that cow&rsquo;s milk competitors are not misbranded if their names don&rsquo;t confuse consumers, said Cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The nutrition comparison</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dairy alternatives, Baldwin said, &quot;contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a bit tricky to evaluate given that beverages labeled as some kind of &quot;milk&quot; now come from such diverse sources as soy, almonds, cashews, hemp, rice, oats, coconut and sunflowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For help, we turned to Vandana Sheth, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a leading organization of food and nutrition professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, Sheth noted that dairy products can be a good source of calcium, vitamin D, protein and other essential nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soy milk provides close to the same amount of protein as cow&rsquo;s milk. Rice milk typically provides minimal protein and is higher in carbohydrates. Almond milk is usually quite low in protein and also less calorically dense, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plant protein tends to be of a lower quality than dairy proteins, though soy is close, said John Lucey, a food scientist who directs the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our own review of labels found that soy and almond beverages, like cow&rsquo;s milk, are all relatively low calorie, low carbohydrate, low sodium drinks. They are all heavy with calcium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they feature a different mix of vitamins and minerals, and fat content. Examples: soy milk has a lot of folate, while cow&rsquo;s milk typically has none; cow&rsquo;s milk contains some Vitamin C, but the soy, almond and hemp drinks we examined have none.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almond and soy milks feature some iron and fiber -- nutrients typically not found in cow&rsquo;s milk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All the products profile differently,&quot; said Susan Levin, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition education for the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: Baldwin&rsquo;s nutrition observation is on target, based on a comparison of milk products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin claimed that imitation dairy products made from plants often differ nutritionally from the real thing, and labeling them &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;cheese&quot; or &quot;yogurt&quot; is &quot;against the law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nutrition point is accurate, and the legal point is partially so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall we rate her claim Mostly True.</p> <div id=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"4cf76934-8d77-415a-82f9-0cd09e75a9f0\" style=\"width: 100%;
