Polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality, as does the general electorate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo a majority of Catholics really favor gay marriage?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoldstein provided PolitiFact New Jersey with two national surveys to support his statement, and they mostly do.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s note that both polls -- and another survey we found -- highlighted the views of white Catholics. Pollsters said this is done to control for race and because white Catholics are considered a swing voter group. But we&rsquo;re going to look at all Catholics since Goldstein didn&rsquo;t distinguish.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, because the Catholics made up a smaller group than the poll sample, the margins of error are higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn ABC News/Washington Post poll released in March asked 1,005 adults, &quot;do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?&quot; It found that among those who identified themselves as Catholic, 60 percent support same-sex marriage and 38 percent oppose it, with a 7.5 percentage point margin of error. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May surveyed 1,007 adults. It asked respondents whether they strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose &quot;allowing gay and lesbian couples to legally marry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt found among the Catholics surveyed, 56 percent either favored or strongly favored and 36 percent either opposed or strongly opposed, with a margin of error of 7 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that in another national poll by the Public Religion Research Institute from September 2010, when Catholics were given the option of choosing civil unions, support for marriage dipped.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt found that of the Catholics surveyed, 43 percent said gay couples should be allowed to marry, 31 percent said gay couples should be allowed to form civil unions but not marry and 22 percent said there should be no legal recognition of a gay couple&rsquo;s relationship. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that in that poll, the more often Catholics said they went to church, the less likely they were to support same-sex marriage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA national Quinnipiac University poll released in July that asked 2,311 registered voters whether they &quot;would support or oppose a law in your state that would same-sex couples to get married?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the Catholics surveyed, 53 percent said they would support such a law in their state and 41 percent said they would oppose, with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMark Gray, a research associate with the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, pointed to his analysis of 2010 data from the General Social Survey, which found that 48 percent of Catholics either strongly agreed or agreed that &quot;homosexual couples should have the right to marry one another&quot; and 36 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed, with a 5.8 percentage point margin of error.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Right now at this point you can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s a majority, you can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s not a majority, given the margin of error,&quot; Gray said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMichele Dillon, chair of University of New Hampshire&rsquo;s department of sociology, said &quot;the actual percentage varies poll to poll, it&rsquo;s either close or over 50 percent,&quot; but, &quot;the momentum is in favor of same-sex marriage&quot; -- both nationally and among Catholics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said &quot;there&rsquo;s no question there&rsquo;s been a movement&quot; in favor of same-sex marriage, mostly driven by a younger generation. Young people, &quot;including young Catholics, are far more likely to be supportive of gay marriage,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, Donohue argued, &quot;people tend to be a bit more liberal&quot; when asked their opinion on the phone, &quot;as opposed to the privacy of the ballot box.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to Goldstein&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoldstein said, &quot;polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality.&quot; We found polls generally support his claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, because the margins of error are so high -- enough to possibly affect the results -- we rate Goldstein&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/gay_marriage_catholics_support.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-29T13:41:06.987784", "ruling_date": "2011-07-31T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Garden State Equality Chairman Steven Goldstein says polls now show a majority of Catholics support gay marriage", "ruling_headline_slug": "garden-state-equality-chairman-steven-goldstein-sa", "ruling_link_text": "How often you go to mass impacts views", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.nj.com/perspective/2011/07/for_nj_same-sex_couples_freedo.html\">For NJ same-sex couples, freedom to marry just a half-mile away</a>,&quot; July 24, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/18/anne-hathaway/anne-hathaway-and-other-celebs-sign/\">Anne Hathaway and other celebs sign letter urging President Obama to join the &#39;majority of Americans&#39; in support of gay marriage</a>,&quot; March 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/slim-majority-back-gay-marriage-post-abc-poll-says/2011/03/17/ABhMc7o_story.html\">Slim majority back gay marriage, Post-ABC poll says</a>,&quot; March 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail and phone interview with Gary Langer, founder and president of Langer Research Associates, July 26-29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail and phone interview with Daniel Cox, director of research for Public Religion Research Institute, July 28-29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Shannon Craig Straw, press secretary for Public Religion Research Institute, July 26, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with April Radocchio, associate poll director for Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, July 28-29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Steven Goldstein, founder and chairman of Garden State Equality, July 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, July 27, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPublic Religion Research Institute, <a href=\"http://www.publicreligion.org/research/?id=579\">Majority of Americans say they support same-sex marriage, adoption by gay and lesbian couples</a>, May 19, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGallup, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/first-time-majority-americans-favor-legal-gay-marriage.aspx\">For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage</a>, May 20, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tQuinnipiac University Polling Institute,<a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1318.xml?ReleaseID=1618\">Age, Religious Gap In New York Gay Marriage Approval, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Back Cuomo Plan To Get Tough On Texters</a>, June 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tQuinnipiac University Polling Institute, <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1624\">President Is Best Of The Worst On Economy, U.S. Voters Tell Quinnipiac University National Poll; Voters Blame Bush Over Obama 2-1 For Financial Mess</a>, July 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/advocates_file_lawsuit_hoping.html\">Advocates file lawsuit hoping to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey</a>, June 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/support-gay-marriage-reaches-milestone-half-americans-support/story?id=13159608\">Support for Gay Marriage Reaches a Milestone</a>, March 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLanger Research Associates, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/1121a6%20Gay%20Marriage.pdf\">ABC News/Washington Post poll: Gay Marriage</a>, March 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Michele Dillon, chair of the department of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, July 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Mark M.
