Ted Cruz, R-Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the unexpected passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative legend, Republicans are hoping to thwart President Barack Obama&rsquo;s chance to nominate a liberal replacement in his final year. Their hope is that the next president will be a Republican who would pick a conservative appointee. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, however, &quot;does not care about conservative justices on the court,&quot; Cruz said of his opponent, in a Feb. 14 interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8xBVeZUZ5E\"><em>This Week</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, the one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge. And he said she would make a terrific justice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered, <a href=\"http://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/a-delicious-judicial-diva-donald-trumps-older-sister-judge-maryanne-trump-barry/ \">who is Trump&rsquo;s sister</a>, and has Trump said he only wants his sister on the court?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is Trump&rsquo;s sister?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s older sister, <a href=\"http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=109&amp;cid=999&amp;ctype=na&amp;instate=na\">Maryanne Trump Barry</a>, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz is correct that President Bill Clinton appointed Barry to this post in 1999. Prior to this position, Barry was a federal judge for the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Ronald Reagan nominated her for that post in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Barry a &quot;hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge,&quot; as Cruz said? Barry isn&#39;t one for trumpeting her political views, and she has avoided talking to reporters. The New York Times wrote a profile of her in August, for example, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/us/politics/familiar-talk-women-from-donald-trump-sister.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">she declined an interview</a>. So we&rsquo;re limited in what we know about her politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump himself said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTlNDrkdXHw\" target=\"_blank\">Feb. 15 press conference</a>, &quot;I don&rsquo;t even know what her views are.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think Cruz is referring to the fact that Barry wrote the majority opinion in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/documents/2006/jan/alitodocuments/plannedparenthood2000.pdf\">2000 panel ruling</a> that found a New Jersey law banning partial-birth abortions to be unconstitutional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is clear that the Act is unconstitutional because it creates an undue burden on a woman&#39;s right to obtain an abortion,&quot; Barry wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting tidbit: Current Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, was also a Third Circuit judge at the time. He heard the partial-birth abortion case, too, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2006/01/24/5081976/judging-samuel-alito-on-abortion-rights\">sided with Barry</a>, arguing that the Supreme Court had ruled similar bans unconstitutional. So it seems a bit unfair to pin Barry as &quot;hardcore pro-abortion&quot; based on this case alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any other indications of Barry&rsquo;s position on abortion. <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PV6qZU_xev8C&amp;q=abortion#v=snippet&amp;q=abortion&amp;f=false\">Trump addressed the issue in his book </a><em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PV6qZU_xev8C&amp;vq=abortion&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">The America We Deserve</a></em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PV6qZU_xev8C&amp;q=abortion#v=snippet&amp;q=abortion&amp;f=false\">, saying</a> Barry declined to answer questions about her personal views on abortion at her 1999 Senate confirmation hearing. We were unable to locate a transcript of the hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/us/politics/familiar-talk-women-from-donald-trump-sister.html?_r=1\">Barry is a well-respected judge</a> on the federal appeals court, which is where quite a few Supreme Court justices come from. But would Trump actually appoint her?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s only kidding, he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump did say his sister would make a &quot;phenomenal&quot; Supreme Court justice, but he was quick to say he wouldn&rsquo;t appoint her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in August, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2015-08-26/donald-trump-the-full-with-all-due-respect-interview \">Bloomberg&rsquo;s </a>Mark Halperin asked Trump if there was anyone he would consider for the court if the opportunity came up. Trump declined to name specific people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then Halperin asked, &quot;How about your sister?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think she would be phenomenal,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I think she would be one of the best, but frankly I think she is &mdash; we&#39;ll have to rule that out now, at least temporarily.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/11/donald-trump-says-his-older-sister-isnt-interested-in-becoming-a-supreme-court-judge/\">October interview with Fox</a>, Trump added that Barry would probably decline the offer, as she is &quot;very happy where she is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minutes after Cruz&rsquo;s<em> This Week</em> interview Feb. 14, Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he would nominate his sister. Trump said that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dies-at-79/trump-says-he-was-kidding-when-he-suggested-his-sister-for-the-court/\">he was just kidding</a> back in his August Bloomberg interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My sister, she also happens to have a little bit different views than me, but I said in that in a very joking manner,&quot; Trump said. &quot;But my sister obviously would not be the right person. It&#39;s a conflict of interest for me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz also said Trump has only suggested his sister as a potential nominee. That may have been accurate for a while, but at a Feb. 13 debate in South Carolina &mdash; the day before Cruz made this claim &mdash; Trump named <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/who-are-diane-sykes-and-bill-pryor-trump-scalia-2016-2\">two potential nominees</a>, neither of whom are members of the Trump family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump suggested Diane Sykes, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Bill Pryor, who sits on the 11th Circuit. Both are conservative George W. Bush appointees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz was the only other candidate at the debate to float a name: Mike Luttig, a former federal judge for whom <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/politics/as-supreme-court-clerk-ted-cruz-made-death-penalty-his-cause.html\">Cruz clerked</a> in Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Cruz&#39;s campaign emphasized that up until the debate, Trump hadn&#39;t named anyone but his sister as a potential Supreme Court pick</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said of Trump, &quot;The one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton. She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz&rsquo;s claim is misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, Trump said his sister would make a good Supreme Court justice. But he said he wouldn&rsquo;t appoint her, and he has named two other potential nominees. And yes, Clinton elevated Trump&rsquo;s sister to the appeals court. But Cruz leaves out that Reagan appointed her to the federal bench in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s sister did join in ruling a New Jersey ban on partial-birth abortions unconstitutional. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Justice Alito &mdash; hardly a &quot;hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge&quot; &mdash; joined in that opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz twisted and left out facts to make a faulty claim about Trump&rsquo;s views on the Supreme Court. We rate Cruz&rsquo;s claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-16T12:37:06.572287", "ruling_date": "2016-02-16T14:25:06", "ruling_headline": "Cruz wrongly says Trump's only Supreme Court pick is his sister, a 'hardcore pro-abortion liberal'", "ruling_headline_slug": "cruz-trump-thinks-his-sister-hardcore-pro-abortion", "ruling_link_text": "Trump says he was kidding", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <em>This Week </em>transcript, Feb. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, Republican debate transcript, Feb. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2015-08-26/donald-trump-the-full-with-all-due-respect-interview\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump: The Full &#39;With All Due Respect&#39; Interview</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dies-at-79/trump-says-he-was-kidding-when-he-suggested-his-sister-for-the-court/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump Says He Was Kidding in Suggesting His Sister for the Court,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/us/politics/familiar-talk-women-from-donald-trump-sister.html?_r=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Familiar Talk on Women, From an Unfamiliar Trump</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/11/donald-trump-says-his-older-sister-isnt-interested-in-becoming-a-supreme-court-judge/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump says his older sister isn&rsquo;t interested in becoming a Supreme Court judge</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2006/01/24/5081976/judging-samuel-alito-on-abortion-rights\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Judging Samuel Alito on Abortion Rights</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 24, 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/documents/2006/jan/alitodocuments/plannedparenthood2000.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Planned Parenthood of Central N.J. vs. Farmer</u><u>,</u></a> July 26, 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MacMillian publishing, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PV6qZU_xev8C&amp;vq=abortion&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The America We Deserve</u></a>, January 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>National Review</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/423196/trump-praises-his-sister-pro-abortion-extremist-judge-ramesh-ponnuru\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump Praises His Sister, a Pro-Abortion Extremist Judge,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Insider, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/who-are-diane-sykes-and-bill-pryor-trump-scalia-2016-2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Meet the 2 people Donald Trump has name-dropped as possible replacements for Justice Scalia,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above the Law, <a href=\"http://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/a-delicious-judicial-diva-donald-trumps-older-sister-judge-maryanne-trump-barry/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;A Delicious Judicial Diva: Donald Trump&rsquo;s Older Sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 19, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 43, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 38, "first_name": "Ted", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1475, "last_name": "Cruz", "mostly_true_count": 22, "name_slug": "ted-cruz", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/CRUZPFTNEW.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1475/", "total_count": 141, "true_count": 7, "website": "http://www.tedcruz.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Says &quot;the one person (Donald Trump)&nbsp;has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton.
