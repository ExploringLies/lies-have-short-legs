The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey&rsquo;s best teachers, and the most education funding ever,&quot; a narrator states as scenes from around New Jersey flash in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We fact-checked the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/09/christie-governor/new-chris-christie-tv-ad-touts-balanced-budgets-jo/\">claims</a> about balanced budgets, taxes and job growth on Thursday. Today we&rsquo;re looking at the ad&rsquo;s education claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s review those claims in more detail, starting with merit pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie&rsquo;s intent may be to give the state&rsquo;s best teachers merit pay, but the program is unavailable to the vast majority of teachers in New Jersey&rsquo;s 588 school districts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far only Newark has merit pay, which the teachers union approved in November. The three-year pact awards bonuses to teachers earning the classification &quot;highly effective&quot; under a new rating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Newark deal is the first of its kind in New Jersey and the nation to base teacher pay on classroom performance, including student progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, four low-income districts -- Asbury Park, Hillside, Lakewood and North Plainfield -- would be eligible for merit pay through a grant from the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Teacher Innovation Fund. Rutgers University would administer the nearly $40 million grant over five years to improve educator recruitment, evaluation and rewards programs. The state Department of Education is expected to roll out a teacher evaluation system this fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So merit pay has been approved for one district in New Jersey, and could eventually apply to teachers in four other districts. That&rsquo;s not exactly rewarding New Jersey&rsquo;s best teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Christie&rsquo;s ad clearly gives the impression that this is a statewide issue,&quot; New Jersey Education Association spokesman Steve Wollmer said in an e-mail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that although Christie supports merit pay for teachers, a bill allowing it has been stalled in the Democrat-controlled Legislature since last fall. The NJEA also opposes merit pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for &quot;most education funding ever,&quot; Christie&rsquo;s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget calls for nearly $9 billion in education funding, about $1 billion more than the previous year. State aid to schools would increase $97 million. While no district saw a state aid decrease, many either received a nominal increase of $1 or their funding remained flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wollmer agreed that in terms of dollars, the ad&rsquo;s claim is correct, but points out that there&rsquo;s more to Christie&rsquo;s education funding story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But what he doesn&rsquo;t mention is that he cut $1.3 billion from state aid in his first year &ndash; Withholding $475 million in aid in January, which was the amount that the state&rsquo;s nearly 600 districts had in total surpluses for unanticipated expenses (a new roof, a bus that needed replacing, an unanticipated special ed placement), and another $820 million in the FY11 budget (which began for schools in September of 2010),&quot; Wollmer said. &quot;Districts cut back dramatically, and 10,000 teachers and staff were laid off, programs were cut, and class sizes increased.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Supreme Court in 2011 also ordered Christie to increase aid to the now-former Abbott districts by about $500 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new TV ad for Christie&rsquo;s re-election campaign claims in part, &quot;Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey&rsquo;s best teachers, and the most education funding ever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The merit pay claim comes across as being available statewide, but so far, the program only applies to teachers in Newark. Of the state&rsquo;s 588 school districts, four others could offer merit pay eventually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Christie may have a history of slashing education funding as a way to close budget holes, but the ad&rsquo;s claim about the most education funding, ever, is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this portion of the ad&rsquo;s claims Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/politifact_nj_state_education.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-09T17:27:47.975378", "ruling_date": "2013-05-12T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie implemented merit pay for teachers, best funding 'ever' for education, ad claims", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-implemented-merit-pay-teachers-best", "ruling_link_text": "Part II: Claims have context concerns", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PQ-SuCqJPA&amp;feature=em-uploademail\">Governor Christie: Jersey Proud</a> TV ad, May 1, 2013, accessed May &nbsp;2 and 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NJ.com, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2012/11/newark_school_merit_pay_contra.html\">Newark teachers union approves landmark contract offering merit pay bonuses</a>, Nov. 14, 2012, accessed May 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NJ.com, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/09/federal_merit_pay_program_to_r.html\">Federal merit pay program to reward teachers across N.J.</a>, Sept. 28, 2012, accessed May 7 and 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Jersey Department of Education website, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/education/news/2013/0228aid.htm\">Christie Administration Announces Highest Levels of K-12 State Aid Funding in New Jersey History</a>, Feb. 28, 2013, accessed May 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NJ.com, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/no_district_will_have_state_ai.html\">No N.J. school district will have state aid cut next year; 40 districts get increase of $1</a>, March 1, 2013, accessed May 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/06/committee-our-childrens-future/television-ad-promotes-chris-christies-spending-cu/\">Television ad promotes Chris Christie&rsquo;s spending cuts, increased education funding</a>, Oct. 6, 2011, accessed May 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NJ.com, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/02/school_vouchers_aid_increase_i.html\">School vouchers, aid increase included in Christie budget</a>, Feb. 26, 2013, accessed May 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail interviews with Kevin Roberts, spokesman, Christie for Governor, May 7 and 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail interview with Steve Wollmer, spokesman, New Jersey Education Association, May 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NJ.com, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/gov_christie_sends_education_r.html\">Christie proposes education reform bills that would eliminate current tenure system for teachers</a>, April 14, 2011, accessed May 9, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Governor of New Jersey", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 27, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1251, "last_name": "Christie", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "chris-christie", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/christie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1251/", "total_count": 105, "true_count": 21, "website": "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone.
