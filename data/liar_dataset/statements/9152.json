Factors affecting eligibility include qualifying for a free- or reduced-price lunch, homelessness or the inability to speak or comprehend English, the institute says. In 2011-12, about 225,000 3- and 4-year-old Texans were enrolled in a pre-k class, the institute says. Abbott&rsquo;s proposal states that nearly all the state&rsquo;s districts offer a state-supported pre-k program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clashing visions, plans</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The candidates are offering clashing visions at a time that some communities, <a href=\"http://www.sanantonio.gov/Pre-K4SanAntonio.aspx\"><u>including San Antonio</u></a>, have moved to expand pre-k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Statesman</em> news story noted that Davis supports a broad expansion of full-day pre-k to all youngsters, costing the state about $750 million a year, the story said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, the story said, Abbott proposes spending an additional $1,500 per student in districts that agree to implement a &quot;gold standard&quot; program consisting of a rigorous curriculum and staff requirements plus assessments to measure effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Senator&#39;s back-up</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said a section of Abbott&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5NUZ1blpLTkZySGM/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>proposal</u></a>, headlined &quot;Effective Pre-k Programs,&quot; was the basis of Davis&rsquo; tweet and petition statement. Abbott&rsquo;s proposal states: &quot;Expanding the population of students served by existing state-funded programs without addressing the quality of existing prekindergarten instruction or how it is being delivered would be an act of negligence and waste.&quot; The sentence was the second paragraph of the <em>Statesman</em> story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petkanas said the part of Abbott&#39;s statement about the state needing to address quality issues--not mentioned in Davis&#39; claim--didn&#39;t diminish the validity of her claim that Abbott said providing pre-k to more students would be a waste. Petkanas further suggested that nothing in Abbott&rsquo;s plan envisions expanded pupil enrollments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petkanas also pointed out a section of Abbott&#39;s proposal touching on the Head Start program. The &quot;best available evidence,&quot; the proposal says, &quot;raises serious doubts that a large public investment in the expansion of pre-k for four year-olds will have the long-term effects claimed by supporters. Lawmakers instead should improve Texas&rsquo; current framework to better serve the existing eligible students.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we read Abbott&#39;s plan with an eye out for indications he opposes expanded pre-k participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Abbott&#39;s proposal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the proposal, Abbott would want districts to participate in his quality-assurance program, but doesn&#39;t propose cuts in state aid for the half-day classes currently mandated. &quot;This proposal would leave the existing pre-k rules untouched,&quot; Abbott&rsquo;s proposal says, while creating the option for districts to seek more aid in return for gauging and ensuring results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The added state cost of Abbott&#39;s approach would initially be $118 million over two years, according to his plan. A footnote says that if every district with a program buys in, so to speak, &quot;allocating enhanced funding for all eligible four-year-olds will cost an additional $294,444,000 annually.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Any increased investment in state-funded pre-K must tie outcomes to funding, and must provide incentives for private providers to offer high-quality kindergarten programs that meet the educational goals established by the state,&quot; the proposal states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott&rsquo;s plan calls any &quot;across-the-board expansion&quot; of pre-k without addressing quality a &quot;disservice to Texas students,&quot; and it says he&rsquo;d leave it up to individual districts to fund full-day pre-k from local funds. &quot;Until a very high-quality, statewide half-day prekindergarten is achieved,&quot; Abbott proposes, &quot;the Legislature should not mandate full-day, but rather lawmakers should allow schools to make that decision based on the needs of their community while still rewarding schools&quot; that &quot;manage a quality program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott spokesman Avdiel Huerta emailed us the text of Abbott&rsquo;s March 31 speech unveiling his pre-k ideas. The remarks speak to Texas transforming pre-k by sending more aid to districts that embrace the &quot;gold standard&quot; program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott said districts adopting his &quot;gold standard&quot; would have leeway to determine effective ways to use the additional funding to meet requirements. &quot;Some districts may choose to hire more teachers,&quot; his speech said. &quot;Others may expand to full day pre-k. Others may choose to expand their existing partnerships with private providers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While critical of existing pre-k, Abbott&#39;s remarks don&rsquo;t directly address the idea of expanding pre-k classes to full days. We asked Huerta how Abbott responded to reporter questions about full-day pre-k. By email, he presented a question and Abbott&rsquo;s reply, which seems to indicate that &quot;gold standard&quot; participants could use the added state aid to offer full-day programs. In the exchange, Abbott also used the abbreviation for independent school districts:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:76.5pt; margin-right:121.5pt\"><strong>REPORTER</strong>: The Davis people are saying that what you proposed is not expanding pre-K. If so, why is that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:76.5pt; margin-right:121.5pt\"><strong>ABBOTT</strong>: Well, if you go back and look at the plan, what our plan does is give flexibility to local ISDs [and] allow them to decide how they want to [approach] pre-K&hellip;Some can take that $1,500 and use it to expand to full-day. Others can [use] it to hire more teachers - you have an almost infinite number of ideas of ways they [can] use the money. They could, say, buy technology. Whatever it is they feel they need. They can use that to craft what they perceive as the best pathway to achieve the Gold Standard in pre-K 4. And so, full day is a possibility for local ISD pre-K 4 if they choose it to be the best pathway for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Davis, Abbott said expanding pre-k to all Texas children would be a waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott said nothing like that in his prepared remarks, while his plan unveiled the same day folds in a caveat that Davis disregarded. In the plan, Abbott says it would be a waste to offer pre-k to more students--without addressing quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the senator&#39;s statement leaves a misimpression, it also has an element of truth. Abbott wouldn&#39;t move now to fund all-day pre-k for all Texas toddlers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We grade the petition claim as Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY FALSE </em></strong><em>&ndash;
