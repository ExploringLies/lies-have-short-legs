The news is filled with stories of small businesses and colleges cutting back worker&#39;s hours or putting a freeze on hiring.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He responded, &quot;I think that&#39;s highly misleading. Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.&quot; (The Affordable Care Act is the more formal name of Obama&rsquo;s health care law.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the other item, we checked a <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4329176\"><u>claim</u></a> made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that &quot;this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Krueger, we checked the change in full-time and part-time employment between March 2010 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment.
