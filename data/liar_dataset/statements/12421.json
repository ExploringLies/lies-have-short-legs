The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the 2015-&rsquo;17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-to-sign-budget-in-waukesha-day-before-2016-announcement-b99536371z1-314340921.html\">cut $250 million</a> over the two years from the UW System.

That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-&rsquo;16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said: &quot;The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system&rsquo;s 2015-&rsquo;16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-&rsquo;74.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-&rsquo;16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest.
