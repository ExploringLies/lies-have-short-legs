Tom Garrett, R-Buckingham, recently explained why he was the lone Virginia senator to vote against the state budget last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Last year, we were the only &lsquo;no&rsquo; vote because (Gov.) McAuliffe and leadership on both sides were telling us that we couldn&rsquo;t fund our core essential functions of government -- public transportation, public education, public safety,&quot; Garrett <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ7PAw8rvx4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> in a Jan. 11 interview on &quot;The John Fredericks Show,&quot; a Portsmouth-based radio program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are teachers that are underpaid. A trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force, and yet they somehow found money to waste on tents for our state parks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What grabbed our attention here is that a veteran state trooper with a decade of service gets a mere $500 more than a newly badged trooper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Garrett -- who is seeking the seat of retiring U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt, R-5th -- &nbsp;where he got his the information. Kevin Reynolds Jr., the senator&rsquo;s chief of staff, told us the source is Wayne Huggins, executive director of the Virginia State Police Association, a professional organization that represents troopers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huggins told us that the relatively flat pay scale of troopers is a &quot;seriously demoralizing&quot; problem that has caused many to leave the state police for better-paying jobs with local law enforcement departments. But he denied telling Garrett that the pay differential between rookies and 10-year veterans was $500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we decided to figure out exactly what, if any difference, exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Starting pay</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Troopers in most parts of the state get a starting salary of $36,207, although troopers patrolling Northern Virginia start at $45,241 due to the high cost of living there, according to figures provided by Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman with the Virginia State Police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a trooper&rsquo;s pay doesn&rsquo;t freeze at that $36,207 level for a decade. As an <a href=\"http://www.vsp.state.va.us/Employment_Trooper_Recruitment_Ad.shtm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>advertisement</u></a> on the State Police website notes, a year after graduating from the State Police Training Academy the salary rises to $40,482 annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So a trooper with 10 years on the force would make almost 12 percent more than a rookie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huggins said there are two tracks for troopers. One is that they can rise through the ranks and become a supervisor, earning extra salary. The other is to remain a trooper and, with seniority and good performance, try to rise to the ranks of &quot;senior trooper&quot; and &quot;master troopers.&quot; These designations also come with a raises, but are only available to those who have been on the force for at least 12 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pay compression package</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing Garrett&rsquo;s statement misses is that the General Assembly last year took the first step in years to address the pay compression issue for state police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2014-2016 budget Garrett opposed contained a $228 salary hike for every year of continuous service as a trooper -- a payment that is only available to those who served at least three years and met performance criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means the 10-year veteran&rsquo;s salary would be $2,280 more than the 10-minute trooper who didn&rsquo;t qualify for it. And let&rsquo;s not forget the 12 percent raise after the rookie year -- worth another $4,175 annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garrett said &quot;trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, the veteran trooper got a 12 percent raise after a year on the force. And last year&rsquo;s budget provides a trooper with a decade on the force an added annual salary increase of $2,280. Altogether, that means a well-performing trooper who has been on the force a decade would earn $6,555 more than a rookie. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not weighing in on whether the state adequately pays its veteran troopers. But Garrett is using an inaccurate number to make the point that Virginia falls short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-31T19:20:11.261275", "ruling_date": "2016-02-01T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tom Garrett is amiss on Virginia state troopers' pay", "ruling_headline_slug": "tom-garrett-amiss-virginia-state-trooper-pay", "ruling_link_text": "Off by about $6,055", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sen.
