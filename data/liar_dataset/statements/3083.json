Not so, writes Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal op-ed columnist for the New York Times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his Jan. 6, 2011 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/07krugman.html%20\">column</a>, titled &quot;the Texas Omen,&quot; Krugman opines that the Texas-style &quot;modern conservative theory of budgeting&quot; ain&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be, now that fiscal reality has intruded. Though he notes that &quot;comparing budget crises among states is tricky,&quot; Krugman does just that, writing that &quot;data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest that the Texas budget gap is worse than New York&rsquo;s, about as bad as California&rsquo;s, but not quite up to New Jersey levels.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if Krugman&rsquo;s comparison was on target. In response, he pointed us to a table in a Dec. 16, 2010 report by the Washington-based center, which studies the impact of state and federal budget decisions on low-income Americans. The report, headlined &quot;States Continue to Feel Recession&rsquo;s Impact,&quot; says the national recession has caused the steepest decline in tax receipts on record, resulting in &quot;a state fiscal crisis of unprecedented severity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTable 3 in the report lists nearly every state confronting a projected fiscal 2012 budget shortfall and compares each shortfall to the state&rsquo;s fiscal 2011 budget. The table says Texas faces a $10 billion shortfall, amounting to 22.3 percent of its 2011 budget. The New York budget gap equals $9 billion, 9 percent of its 2011 budget, while the expected gaps for California and New Jersey equal $19.2 billion (22.2 percent) and $10.5 billion (37.4 percent), respectively, of each state&rsquo;s 2011 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the 2012 Texas shortfall appeared to be worse than New York&rsquo;s, about as bad as California&rsquo;s, but not quite up--actually, hardly close--to New Jersey&rsquo;s level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report says the center&rsquo;s sources for the Texas breakdown includes an analysis of state agency budget requests and other information by the Austin-based Center on Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs that serve low-income Texans. The two similarly-named organizations occasionally collaborate on projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Eva DeLuna-Castro, the Austin center&rsquo;s senior budget analyst, who said the shortfall figure cited for Texas reflected her earlier research indicating that the state would need about $20 billion in additional revenue to extend current programs and services through 2012-13. One year&rsquo;s worth of the shortfall estimate is $10 billion. DeLuna-Castro noted that at the time of the Washington center&rsquo;s research, Texas state government expected to spend $45 billion in fiscal 2011, a figure since reduced to $42.6 billion to account for agencies&rsquo; spending cuts last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeLuna-Castro said she has studied the California shortfall projection and thinks the Washington center&rsquo;s research is solid there. She said she hasn&rsquo;t studied projected shortfalls for New York or New Jersey. Finally, she cautioned that comparisons might overlook the fact that Texas lawmakers could tap billions of dollars in the state&rsquo;s rainy day fund. She said other states, which budget annually, may have already dug into such funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat seems a reasonable point. The Texas rainy day fund could ease the state&rsquo;s shortfall--a fact not mentioned in Krugman&rsquo;s column. Then again, tapping the fund requires a two-thirds vote of the GOP-majority Legislature, and some Republican legislators have said the fund is off-limits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, the lead author of the state-by-state comparison, Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow with the Washington center, told us the comparison would soon be updated to reflect increases in projected shortfalls for Texas and California. &quot;The problem that Texas is facing is on a similar level to these other states,&quot; McNichol said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/jan/12/talmadge-heflin/talmadge-heflin-says-claims-state-government-27-bi/\">we noted recently,</a> the Center for Public Policy Priorities now estimates that Texas needs nearly $27 billion more than the state expects to raise from taxes and other sources to maintain current government services and programs through 2012-13. McNichol told us by e-mail that the Washington center consequently considers the updated 2012 Texas shortfall to be $13.4 billion, equal to nearly 30 percent of the 2011 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time of Krugman&rsquo;s column, the projected Texas shortfall was nowhere near New Jersey&rsquo;s level. The comparisons of expected shortfalls in Texas, New York and California were accurate.<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-20T14:28:58.919107", "ruling_date": "2011-01-21T10:25:51", "ruling_headline": "Paul Krugman compares projected shortfalls for Texas, California, New York and New Jersey", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-krugman-compares-projected-shortfalls-texas-c", "ruling_link_text": "New Jersey reference is off", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail (excerpted), <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/01122011_paulkrugmanresponsepftexas.html%20\">response</a> to PolitiFact Texas, Paul Krugman, Jan. 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Eva DeLuna-Castro, senior budget analyst, Center for Public Policy Priorities, Austin, Jan. 19, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/01202011_lizmcnicholresponsepftexas.html\">e-mail</a> (excerpted), Elizabeth McNichol, senior fellow, Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, Washington, Jan. 19, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Times, oped column, Paul Krugman, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/07krugman.html%20\">&quot;The Texas Omen,&quot;</a> Jan. 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter for Budget and Policy Priorities, report, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=711%20\">States Continue to Feel Recession&rsquo;s Impact</a>,&quot; (accessed Jan. 19, 2011)</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "New York Times columnist", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 185, "last_name": "Krugman", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "paul-krugman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/krugman.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/185/", "total_count": 18, "true_count": 8, "website": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays that &quot;data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest that the Texas budget gap is worse than New York&rsquo;s, about as bad as California&rsquo;s, but not quite up to New Jersey levels.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an op-ed column.", "statement_date": "2011-01-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 30, "current_job": "U.S. Energy Secretary", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 42, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 291, "last_name": "Perry", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "rick-perry", "pants_count": 18, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Perry_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/291/", "total_count": 176, "true_count": 26, "website": "https://energy.gov/management/history/secretaries-energy"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
