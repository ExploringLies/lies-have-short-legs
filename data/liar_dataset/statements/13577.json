It appeared the same day <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/311006-when-does-the-electoral-college-vote\">members of the Electoral College</a> voted to officially elect Trump the 45th president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said a 47-year-old Michigan elector named Jeremy Hashville killed himself in an absurdly complicated fashion, revealing in a note that he could not bear to vote for Trump. The post was flagged by Facebook as part of the company&rsquo;s efforts to fight fake news online. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing about the story or its extreme premise is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, we found no evidence of an elector named Jeremy Hashville, in Michigan or any other state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there had been a lot of talk about electors potentially switching their votes to deny Trump the 270 needed to win the Electoral College, little came of it. Only two Republican electors, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/politics/electoral-college-donald-trump-vote/index.html\">from Texas</a>, changed their votes to avoid choosing Trump (another Texan elector <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/12/07/504651708/texas-elector-resigns-saying-he-cant-vote-for-trump-in-electoral-college\">had resigned</a> and was replaced). No electors nationwide committed suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michigan electors said prior to the vote that they were <a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2016/12/04/Ohio-Michigan-electors-say-they-won-t-switch-votes.html\">not going to attempt to flip</a>, but they couldn&rsquo;t have even if they had wanted to do so. Electors in Michigan are <a href=\"https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(rq2vvzye4r5ikw2hts3o0b3v))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-168-47\">bound by state law</a> to vote for the winner of the state&rsquo;s presidential election. If they don&rsquo;t, they will be replaced with someone who will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A photo included with the story said it was of Hashville, but was actually an <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/politics-podcast-hamilton-electors-anti-trump-plot-and-inslees-4-billion-tax-bump-on-the-overcast/\">Associated Press image</a> of Washington state Democratic elector Bret Chiafalo. He was part of an effort called the Hamilton Electors &mdash; members of the Electoral College who hoped to flip enough Republican electors to deny Trump the presidency. (Their effort clearly failed.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing on the UniversePolitics.com site to indicate the story was fake, but it did include a source link to another site called WorldNewsDailyReport.com. The same story and photo <a href=\"http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/electoral-college-elector-commits-suicide-to-avoid-voting-for-donald-trump/\">appeared on that site</a>, which says <a href=\"http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/disclaimer_/\">in a disclaimer</a> that the posts on the site are &quot;entirely fictional.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to contact both websites but did not get a response from either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s clear that the story is completely made up, and posted in an attempt to capitalize on a real event.
