Ron Paul makes this claim:\n<p>\n \"Congressman Paul introduces numerous pieces of substantive legislation each year, probably more than any single member of Congress.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We'll give him points for qualifying his claim by saying it is \"probably more\" than others, but our tally shows he falls short.\n</p>\n<p>\n By early September 2007, Ron Paul has introduced 49 bills this year. That puts him fifth out of 540 members of Congress. Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., has the most at 59.\n</p>\n<p>\n Most of Paul's bills are substantive &ndash; that is, he doesn't often introduce legislation such as naming post offices, reducing the duty on a specialized piece of manufacturing equipment or congratulating a sports team. Indeed, he's introduced substantive bills such as the Sanctity of Life Act, which fixes the beginning of life at conception; a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants; and a constitutional amendment with the effect of abolishing income, state and gift taxes.\n</p>\n<p>\n But in the last Congress, he was far short of being the most prolific bill-writer. He was 25th overall in the number of bills introduced, with 71 bills, 66 of which could be called substantive. We give Robert E. Andrews, D-N.J., the prize for most substantive bills in the 109th. He introduced 128, 119 of them that were substantive.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:37.439152", "ruling_date": "2007-09-17T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lotsa bills, but not the most", "ruling_headline_slug": "lotsa-bills-but-not-the-most", "ruling_link_text": "Lotsa bills, but not the most", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/bss/d110/sponlst.html\">\n Summary of sponsors and co-sponsors, 110th Congress\n</a>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/bss/d109/sponlst.html\">\n  Summary of sponsors and co-sponsors, 109th Congress\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "U.S. representative", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Ron", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 15, "last_name": "Paul", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "ron-paul", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-ronpaul.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/15/", "total_count": 40, "true_count": 8, "website": "https://www.facebook.com/ronpaul"}, "statement": "\"Congressman Paul introduces numerous pieces of substantive legislation each year, probably more than any single member of Congress.\"", "statement_context": "a statement on his campaign Web site.", "statement_date": "2007-09-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
