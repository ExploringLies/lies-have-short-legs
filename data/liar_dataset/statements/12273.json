Jackson&rsquo;s appearance on the bill has stirred up controversy as of late, especially because Jackson, a populist and a war hero, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html\">presided</a> over the removal of approximately 46,000 Native Americans from their land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Carson had his historical facts straight. We took Carson&rsquo;s statement to mean that Jackson was the last president to do both things: balance the budget and eliminate debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of presidents have presided over balanced budgets, which is when the government takes in more revenue than it spends, leading to no net borrowing in that year. But a balanced budget doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean no debt, because old debt can carry over from previous years. Jackson was, in fact, the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this wasn&rsquo;t nearly as dramatic of an accomplishment as it would be today. Experts told us to take this factoid with a grain of salt because the debt was already on its way down, and by the time Jackson took office, the amount of debt was trivial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The history</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson, who served from 1829-37, was an ardent supporter of keeping banks and government separated. He believed that banks would have undue influence on government, and he was hell-bent on eliminating the debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Jackson was also deeply skeptical of paper currency, which adds some irony to the current debate over his position on the $20 bill.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 1829, <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm\">the debt was</a> about $58 million. (Jackson took office that March.) In today&rsquo;s dollars, that amounts to about <a href=\"http://www.in2013dollars.com/1829-dollars-in-2016?amount=58000000\">$1.4 billion</a>. The total public <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\">debt outstanding today</a> is higher by many orders of magnitude: $19.2 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson watched that debt scale down to zero in <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_19cent.htm\">1835</a>. According to the <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_19cent.htm\">Treasury Department</a>, the debt remained close to zero when Jackson left office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Jackson didn&rsquo;t have to take much action to make this happen. Since the end of the War of 1812, which racked up a lot of debt, Congress required debt reductions of at least $10 million per year under under Jackson&rsquo;s two predecessors, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. So all Jackson really had to do was maintain the status quo, said <a href=\"http://history.utk.edu/people/daniel-feller/\">Daniel Feller</a>, a Jackson expert at the University of Tennessee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The policy of paying off the debt happened before Jackson, and he happened to be president&quot; when the debt hit zero, Feller said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to continuing the already-established debt-reduction policy, Jackson vetoed some infrastructure bills that would have spent money on things like building roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also liquidated the Second Bank of the United States, a precursor to the Federal Reserve, resulting in a massive surplus of government money that was used to pay off the last of the debt, said <a href=\"https://www.law.gwu.edu/neil-h-buchanan\">Neil Buchanan</a>, an expert in federal spending patterns at George Washington University Law School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately following Jackson&rsquo;s departure, the country experienced a financial crisis, the Panic of 1837. The panic resulted from several factors, including the collapse of a speculative land bubble and international capital flows, but some economists believe Jackson&rsquo;s fiscal policies should carry some of the blame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The country did eventually have the good sense to borrow again, to finance the country&#39;s enormous economic expansion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,&quot; Buchanan said, noting that it is not always desirable to bring debt down to zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the only president to see a national debt of zero, Jackson certainly wasn&rsquo;t the only president who presided over a balanced budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In today&rsquo;s world, it&rsquo;s rare for the federal government to balance its budget, meaning revenue is higher than expenditures. Since the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/may/07/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-balanced-budgets-rare/\">only five years</a> have had balanced federal budgets: 1969 under President Richard Nixon; 1998, 1999 and 2000 under Bill Clinton; and 2001 under George W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in earlier years, balanced budgets were much more regular. From 1900 to 1960, about 25 years had balanced budgets, according to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/hist.pdf\">government historical tables</a>. Before that, we don&rsquo;t have &nbsp;year-to-year budget breakdowns. But we do know that there was an overall budget surplus from <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/hist.pdf\">1800 through 1850</a>, so balanced budgets were a fairly regular occurrence around the time Jackson was in office. Fuller backed up that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Carson is merely applauding Jackson for having paid off the debt through a one-time gimmick,&quot; as opposed to adjusting policy to keep the debt low for the long run, Buchanan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson said, &quot;Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts say this feat doesn&rsquo;t really deserve the plaudits Carson is giving it, but Carson has his facts basically right. Jackson was the last &mdash; and only &mdash; president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs added context, which is our definition of Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/72b86490-26c7-4af9-81a5-736827d02e19\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/72b86490-26c7-4af9-81a5-736827d02e19</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-21T16:42:54.343288", "ruling_date": "2016-04-21T17:06:40", "ruling_headline": "Was Andrew Jackson the only U.S. president to bring national debt to zero?", "ruling_headline_slug": "andrew-jackson-debt-balanced-budget-president", "ruling_link_text": "Expert: 'One-time gimmick'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/us/women-currency-treasury-harriet-tubman.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Harriet Tubman Ousts Andrew Jackson in Change for a $20,</u></a>&quot; April 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury Direct, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo1.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Historical Debt Outstanding - Annual 1790 - 1849</u></a>,&quot; accessed April 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury Direct, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_19cent.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The 19th Century,</u></a>&quot; accessed April 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury Direct, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It,</u></a>&quot; accessed April 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Office of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/hist.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Historical Tables: Budget of the U.S. Government,</u></a>&quot; FY 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBS, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2959.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Indian removal,&quot;</u></a> accessed April 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/may/07/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-balanced-budgets-rare/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Vern Buchanan says balanced budgets are rare in Washington,</u></a>&quot; May 7, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, GW Law professor Neil Buchanan, April 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview, University of Tennessee professor Daniel Feller, April 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, historian Franklin Noll, April 21, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "Ben", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 3108, "last_name": "Carson", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "ben-carson", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/MCT_US_NEWS_CAMPAIGN-CPAC_2.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3108/", "total_count": 28, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.bencarson.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Fox Business interview", "statement_date": "2016-04-20", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 296, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/296/", "subject": "Debt", "subject_slug": "debt", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/47/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
