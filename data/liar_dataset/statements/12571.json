Cosmetically they look different, they function exactly the same,&quot; the Wisconsin Republican said on the June 19, 2016 edition of <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/ryan-people-have-a-right-to-have-semi-automatic-rifles-708570180000\">the show</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, look, we can go into all of these issues other than to say, people have a constitutional right to bear arms. People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Todd then interrupted Ryan, saying: &quot;There&rsquo;s nothing in the Second Amendment that says you have a right for a semiautomatic. You can regulate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan agreed that the government can put restrictions on guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about his statement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do Americans have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five experts we consulted agreed that Ryan was generally on target -- though, as University of Texas law professor <a href=\"https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/siv245/\">Stephen Vladeck</a> put it, &quot;there&rsquo;s a ton of nuance behind&quot; his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2008 case key</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic rifles, which fire continuously when the trigger is pressed, are essentially banned by federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Semiautomatics -- which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed -- are not banned, though some states do impose restrictions on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To check Ryan&rsquo;s claim, we spoke with four law professors who are experts on gun law: Vladeck; <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/23149/nicholas_johnson\">Nicholas Johnson</a> of Fordham University; <a href=\"http://www2.cortland.edu/departments/political-science/faculty-staff-detail.dot?fsid=312710\">Robert Spitzer</a> of State University of New York-Cortland; and <a href=\"https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/adam-winkler/\">Adam Winkler</a> at UCLA in Los Angeles. We also spoke to <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/people/adam-bates\">Adam Bates</a>, a criminal justice policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-ii\">Second Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution -- &quot;the right of the people to keep and bear arms&quot; -- was passed by Congress in 1789 and ratified two years later. So, it does not, of course, explicitly declare a right to have a semiautomatic rifle, a version of which wasn&rsquo;t <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/evolution-of-semi-automatic-weapons-2012-12\">invented</a> <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20130215/assault-weapons-overview\">until</a> about a century later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court also has not explicitly declared a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But semiautomatic rifles, as Ryan suggested with his reference to a hunting rifle, have been widely owned and commonly used for generations. The courts have allowed states to put restrictions on such rifles, but they have long been a legal firearm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the experts cited a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf\">decision</a> in what is known as the Heller case, the high court&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/law/help/second-amendment.php\">first decision</a> interpreting the Second Amendment since 1939. In a 5-4 ruling, the court said the Second Amendment confers an individual right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key excerpts of the decision, which was written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home .... &nbsp;it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heller was a handgun case. But each of the experts told us that the decision has been read to includes semiautomatic rifles as being among guns protected by the Second Amendment -- and that any attempt to ban them (not restrict them) would very likely&nbsp;be ruled unconstitutional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan said: &quot;People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court decision has not explicitly declared that Americans have a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles. And states can, within certain parameters, put restrictions on those guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But generally speaking, experts told us, semiautomatic rifles are a legal weapon that fall under the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Ryan&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f9697744-16cb-49ae-8885-8b6b5b4024f9\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f9697744-16cb-49ae-8885-8b6b5b4024f9</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-23T17:16:53.557080", "ruling_date": "2016-06-24T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Is there a Second Amendment right to semiautomatic rifles?", "ruling_headline_slug": "second-amendment-right-semiautomatic-rifles", "ruling_link_text": "Not explicitly, but essentially yes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NBC, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/ryan-people-have-a-right-to-have-semi-automatic-rifles-708570180000\">Meet the Press</a>, June 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Paul Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana, June 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/20/ron-johnson/aftermath-orlando-gop-sen-ron-johnson-says-assault/\">&quot;Question after Orlando: Are assault rifles banned?
