Yes, though he later said it was a joke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original source of this claim was a tweet Trump sent on Nov. 6, 2012, as we noted in a January 2016 <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/bernie-s/yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h/\">fact-check</a> of a similar claim by Clinton&rsquo;s Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s tweet said, &quot;The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uDFmIDPzCo4znxgzKlT0_jgv4CqHkarUrQ005ED_HbclD4Ex32hmOHsAn95kbFc_WZMiOQ1BMlRj4Fu-vDLyOgnT3syuxfWFY8KxoEWpqd9gxcPzZnQUM8q76jkJzs7IQUNr_cUt\" style=\"border:none; height:321px; width:617px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Clinton certainly has evidence to support her claim. But we should also note that Trump backed off his claim after Sanders noted them in January on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em>, calling the Chinese link a &quot;joke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump&rsquo;s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>, &quot;Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I&#39;d be &mdash; received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn&#39;t care less. They have very &mdash; you know, their standards are nothing. But they &mdash; in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it&#39;s very hard on our business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump may call the mention of China&rsquo;s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word &quot;hoax&quot; to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a &quot;hoax&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/01/lenar-whitney/republican-congressional-hopeful-says-global-warmi/\">Pants on Fire</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., &quot;Obama&#39;s talking about all of this with the global warming and &hellip; a lot of it&#39;s a hoax. It&#39;s a hoax. I mean, it&#39;s a money-making industry, okay? It&#39;s a hoax, a lot of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s three times using &quot;hoax&quot; in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his 2012 tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">tweeted</a>, &quot;NBC News just called it the great freeze &mdash; coldest weather in years.

In fact, he&rsquo;s enshrined opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-deliver-energy-policy-speech-north-dakota-39401469\">high-profile</a> <a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060037907\">speech</a> on <a href=\"http://time.com/4349309/donald-trump-bismarck-energy-speech/\">energy policy</a> in North Dakota on May 26, 2016, Trump attacked &quot;draconian climate rules.&quot; He <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/an-america-first-energy-plan\">advocated</a> rescinding &quot;all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan&quot; and said he would &quot;cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords unilaterally and without the permission of Congress,&quot; Trump said. &quot;This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump did tweet that view in 2012, though he made efforts earlier this year to describe that remark as a &quot;joke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a &quot;hoax&quot; in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn&rsquo;t necessarily repeated the charge that China &quot;invented&quot; climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change &quot;is done for the benefit of China.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-03T11:40:31.478950", "ruling_date": "2016-06-03T12:00:53", "ruling_headline": "Yes, Donald Trump did call climate change a Chinese hoax", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h", "ruling_link_text": "Later called it a 'joke,' but has used 'hoax' often", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, foreign policy speech, June 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernie Sanders, comments on NBC&rsquo;s Meet the Press, Jan. 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en\">tweet</a>, Nov. 6, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856\">tweet</a>, Jan. 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428414113463955457\">tweet</a>, Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428418323660165120\">tweet</a>, Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, comments on Fox &amp;
