But if we looked back a few years earlier in the 1990s, we found a higher rate of firearm deaths -- for example 11.73 in 1991. So if Cordray had drawn on a comparison from an earlier year in the 1990s, it wouldn&rsquo;t show as much of a contrast as comparing 1999 and 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Why did gun deaths increase in Ohio</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Why</em> gun deaths have increased in Ohio is the more difficult question to answer -- something that Cordray didn&rsquo;t comment about on his<a href=\"https://secure.cordrayforohio.com/page/content/on-the-issues/\"> website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Randolph Roth, co-founder of the <a href=\"https://cjrc.osu.edu/research/interdisciplinary/hvd\">Historical Violence Database</a> at Ohio State University, told PolitiFact that there has been a tremendous surge in homicides in recent years in Ohio&rsquo;s major cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 2016 was <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/01/year_in_review_homicides_surge.html\">Cleveland&rsquo;s deadliest year in a decade</a>. The <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer </em>reported that Cleveland&#39;s uptick in homicides was particularly significant but continued an <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/12/cleveland_ends_one_of_deadlies.html\">upward trend</a> that began in 2014 and intensified in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the increase in homicides in Ohio. Using CDC data, he showed that the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4435924-Firearm-Deaths.html\">increases in firearm deaths are primarily in the midwest and Ohio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The opioid increase is disproportionately concentrated in the midwest and also concentrated among whites,&quot; Rosenfeld told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosenfeld elaborated on that point in a 2017 paper for the <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/251067.pdf\">National Institute of Justice</a> in which he called for more research on the causes behind the homicide rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim Irvine, a volunteer with the Buckeye Firearms Association, noted that CDC data shows an increase in suicides overall and that &quot;guns are one of several methods/tools used.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CDC data shows that the rate of suicides both by firearms -- and without firearms -- increased between 1999 and 2016 in Ohio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Buckeye Firearms Association hasn&rsquo;t endorsed in the Democratic primary but did endorse Attorney General Mike DeWine in the Republican primary. The association endorsed Cordray for Attorney General when he ran against DeWine in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordray said on his website that &quot;since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from the Centers for Disease Control showed that there were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. Firearm deaths in suicides and homicides increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Cordray had selected an earlier year in the 1990s, the contrast would not have been as extreme when there was a higher rate of firearm deaths. However, his comparison of 1999 and 2016 is one valid way to examine the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-11T11:09:39.835224", "ruling_date": "2018-04-12T10:54:49", "ruling_headline": "Cordray on point about increase in firearm deaths in Ohio", "ruling_headline_slug": "cordray-point-about-increase-firearm-deaths-ohio", "ruling_link_text": "Gun deaths climb", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Richard Cordray, <a href=\"https://secure.cordrayforohio.com/page/content/on-the-issues/\">Campaign website</a>, April 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control, <a href=\"https://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate.html\">Fatal Injury Reports, National, Regional and State</a>, 1981 &ndash; 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/03/gov_john_kasich_unveils_gun_co.html\">&quot;Ohio Gov.
