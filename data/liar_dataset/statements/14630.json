Corker worked with (Democratic House Leader) Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation, and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal,&quot; she said in an Oct. 10 press briefing, adding, &quot;He not only allowed the deal to happen, he gave it credibility.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislation Sanders was referring to is the Corker-sponsored Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. After initial resistance from President Barack Obama, the bill passed with overwhelming majorities in both chambers, and was signed into law in May 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corker&rsquo;s office <a href=\"https://www.corker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/iran-nuclear-agreement-review-act\">described</a> the law as enhancing Congress&rsquo; authority to review any nuclear agreement with Iran before allowing a president to lift congressionally-imposed sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if Corker&rsquo;s law aimed to give Congress more say over the agreement, what to make of the Trump administration&rsquo;s assertion that it paved the way for the deal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is astonishingly wrong,&quot; said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar on global energy policy at Columbia University, who previously served as the lead sanctions expert for the U.S. team negotiating with Iran during the administration of President Barack Obama. &quot;The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act gave Congress the most direct way of killing the deal, quickly and easily.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, also said the Trump administration was way off the mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is ludicrous to argue that Senator Corker and Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act are responsible for delivering the nuclear deal with Iran,&quot; she said. &quot;If anything, (the law) nearly prevented the deal&#39;s implementation and undermined the agreement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump-Corker feud comes at a time when the Iran deal faces intense scrutiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By law, the Trump administration must report to Congress on the deal every 90 days, including whether Iran is complying, and if it&rsquo;s in the U.S. national security interest to continue sanctions relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next deadline is Oct. 15, and experts say Trump may decline to certify the deal on national security grounds. Decertifying the deal would not immediately kill it. Rather, it opens the door for Congress to quickly reimpose sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corker sponsored legislation to enhance Congress&rsquo; authority to review the Iran nuclear deal before allowing the president to lift congressionally-imposed sanctions.
