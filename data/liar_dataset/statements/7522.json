Chris Christie&rsquo;s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget that impact various environmental funds and suggesting that low staffing means fewer people ensuring the state&rsquo;s air is clean and people are protected from flooding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs Tittel right that the state&rsquo;s environmental arm is reducing staffing at great risk to New Jerseyans?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot quite.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, let&rsquo;s review the number of people on staff at the DEP and how those levels have fluctuated through the years. Then we&rsquo;ll compare current staffing with levels from the mid-1980s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTittel claimed the DEP has 2,812 employees, but that figure is the staffing level proposed for the fiscal year 2014 budget, according to Larry Ragonese, DEP spokesman. Currently, the DEP has 2,734 employees, he said. So Tittel is off by 78 workers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s worth noting that Christie has the final say on the budget and must approve it by June 30. The new fiscal year starts on July 1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo how is DEP staffing now compared with the mid-1980s?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe asked Ragonese for annual DEP staffing levels from 1970 to present, but since Tittel wasn&rsquo;t more specific than &quot;the mid-80s,&quot; we&rsquo;ll look at years 1983 through 1987 and compare those with more recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>1983:</strong> 2,214</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>1984:</strong> 2,226</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>1985:</strong> 2,486</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>1986:</strong> 2,704</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>1987:</strong> 3,062</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>2010:</strong> 2,960</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>2011:</strong> 2,846</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>2012:</strong> 2,736</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>2013:</strong> 2,734</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><strong>2014: </strong>2,812*<br />\r\n\t\t\t<em>*proposed in FY2014 budget</em></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"><em>Source: New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">Using the current staff figure of 2,734, Tittel is correct that the DEP&rsquo;s employment levels are the lowest since 1986 -- the mid-1980s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Tittel didn&rsquo;t use that number. He said 2,812 employees. That means DEP staffing is the lowest it&rsquo;s been since 2012 and now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why is staffing a big concern for Tittel and the Sierra Club?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;By having less staff and less hours you don&rsquo;t have the people that are needed to do all that needs to be done,&quot; Tittel told us. &quot;We&rsquo;ve also added a lot more programs to the DEP to contend with -- the Highlands, the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, global warming and a few other programs. They&rsquo;re stressed out in a &nbsp;lot of these areas because they have a lot on their plate and less people.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRagonese disagrees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile DEP staffing at one point topped 4,000 (in the early 1990s), the state&rsquo;s environmental concerns have changed, requiring less staffing. The agency also has worked to become more streamlined and efficient in accordance with goals set by Christie and DEP Commissioner Bob Martin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We&rsquo;re taking care of the state&rsquo;s air, water, land and natural resources but we have to run like a business, to make this place work better, to take steps away from being a horrible bureaucracy,&quot; Ragonese said. He added that DEP has improved water quality and air quality levels while reducing emissions and contaminants.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"><strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTittel claimed in a recent op-ed column that the &quot;DEP has 2,812 employees, the lowest level since the mid-&rsquo;80s.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTittel&rsquo;s number is off a bit. The DEP has 2,734 employees this year but could increase that to 2,812, under Christie&rsquo;s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">As for the rest of Tittel&rsquo;s claim, he&rsquo;s right that the DEP&rsquo;s staffing level is the lowest since the mid-1980s -- if he bases that off current staffing. But he used the proposed staffing figure of 2,812 employees, which means the DEP personnel roster is the lowest it&#39;s been in only the past couple of years.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">We rate Tittel&#39;s claim Half True.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">To comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/politifact_nj_jeff_tittel_of_sierra_club_claims_state_deps_staffing_is_lowest_since_mid-1980s.html\">NJ.com</a>.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-14T17:08:39.636494", "ruling_date": "2013-03-17T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Sierra Club's Jeff Tittel claims DEP staffing levels lowest since mid-1980s", "ruling_headline_slug": "sierra-clubs-jeff-tittel-claims-dep-staffing-level", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers are off", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NJ.com, New Jersey&rsquo;s environment is under attack in Christie&rsquo;s budget: Opinion, March 2, 2013, accessed March 6 and 14, 2013<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhone interview with Larry Ragonese, spokesman, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, March 6 and 7, 2013<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhone interview with Jeff Tittel, director, New Jersey Sierra Club, March 13, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Director of the New Jersey Sierra Club", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Jeff", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 1316, "last_name": "Tittel", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "jeff-tittel", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/tittel.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Jersey", "edition": "New Jersey", "edition_slug": "new-jersey", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 13, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Jersey Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/13/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1316/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://newjersey.sierraclub.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;DEP has 2,812 employees, the lowest level since the mid-&rsquo;80s.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an op-ed column on NJ.com", "statement_date": "2013-03-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Most scientists agree that climate change is real and humans are causing it.
