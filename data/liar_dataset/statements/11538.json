Shortly after the fact-check published, a Rubio spokesman&nbsp;said Rubio said North Korea possessed &quot;over two-dozen nuclear warheads.&quot; As such, we have updated this fact-check and changed the rating to Half True.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a &quot;happy hour&quot;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/10/30/marco-rubio-rides-wave-interest-during-campaign-stop/74802338/\" target=\"_blank\">meet-and-greet at Bev&rsquo;s on the River in Sioux City</a>, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio rattled off a litany of international threats facing the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topping that list was North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weapons stockpile and the reclusive communist country&rsquo;s potential for launching a nuclear missile at the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And then you look abroad, and you see a world that&rsquo;s increasingly dangerous. You have a lunatic in North Korea,&quot; Rubio said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. &quot;A lunatic. Except he has over two-dozen nuclear warheads. And a long-range missile that can already reach the United States with that warhead on it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the statement to be evaluated is: Does North Korea really have more than two-dozen nuclear weapons?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is no, not quite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous credible arms and security organizations estimate North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal at&nbsp;six to&nbsp;16 nuclear weapons. Even at the high side of those estimates,&nbsp;Rubio is overestimating the North Korean nuclear threat by about 50 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for sources supporting Rubio&#39;s claim, his campaign provided a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/04/23/just-how-many-nuclear-weapons-does-north-korea-have-a-look-at-the-numbers/\" target=\"_blank\">link to a story echoing that 16-warhead estimate</a>&nbsp;but also noting a Chinese estimate of up to 20.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A wide consensus exists that North Korea has the capability to construct up to eight plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons. This view is shared by think tanks including the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/north-korea-nuclear-disarmament/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuclear Threat Initiative</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat\" target=\"_blank\">Arms Control Association</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sipriyearbook.org/view/9780198737810/sipri-9780198737810-chapter-11-div1-10.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, a 2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34256.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report from the Congressional Research Service</a>&nbsp;estimated that North Korea has enough plutonium for &quot;at least a half dozen&quot; weapons and the capability to produce another single &quot;bomb&rsquo;s worth of plutonium per year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NKNF-NK-Nuclear-Futures-Wit-0215.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report from the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University&rsquo;s School of Advanced International Studies</a>&nbsp;agrees with the estimate of eight plutonium bombs and adds that North Korea may also have enough uranium for&nbsp;four to&nbsp;eight more nuclear bombs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Johns Hopkins paper goes on to project the potential growth of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal. In its most aggressive prediction, the paper suggests the country could have 100 weapons by 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio also claimed that North Korea has long-range missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to American shores. He&#39;s on firm ground there.&nbsp;Admiral Bill Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/north-korea-could-hit-us-homeland-with-nuclear-weapon-says-top-admiral\" target=\"_blank\">told a Washington think tank last month</a>&nbsp;that North Korea has the ability to miniaturize its nuclear weapons and place them on a missile that could reach the United States. That view is also reflected in the Johns Hopkins report&nbsp;and elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some caveats, though. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NKNF_Delivery-Systems.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">another Johns Hopkins report</a>, one intercontinental ballistic missile in North Korea&rsquo;s arsenal, the Taepodong-2, is a &quot;militarized version&quot; of a rocket designed to launch satellites into space. It is believed to have a range that would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the continental United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three of the Taepodong-2&rsquo;s four known test launches ended in failure. The re-entry vehicle necessary for deploying a nuclear weapon from the missile, moreover, is crude, inaccurate and has never been tested, according to the Johns Hopkins report.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gortney, the NORAD commander, referred to another missile, the KN-08, which is believed to be&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-general-north-korea-has-nuclear-capable-missile-that-can-hit-us-2015-4\" target=\"_blank\">capable of reaching targets on the West Coast of the United States</a>. But it&nbsp;hasn&#39;t been flight tested and, like the Taepodong-2, is&nbsp;probably not accurate enough to reliably hit a target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio claimed that&nbsp;North Korea&nbsp;&quot;has over two-dozen nuclear warheads.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That overstates North Korea&rsquo;s estimated nuclear arsenal by about 50 percent, but isn&rsquo;t egregious given the relatively small numbers involved. (The U.S., by contrast, has more than 7,000 nukes.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Rubio&rsquo;s claim&nbsp;Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-09T15:09:23.186714", "ruling_date": "2015-11-14T00:14:51", "ruling_headline": "Rubio claims North Korea has more than two dozen nuclear warheads", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-north-korea-has-over-two-dozen-nukes", "ruling_link_text": "A bit off target", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Nuclear Threat Initiative, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/north-korea-nuclear-disarmament/\">Nuclear disarmament North Korea</a>,&quot; Sept. 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arms Control Association, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat\">Nuclear weapons: Who has what at a glance</a>,&quot; October, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SIPRI Yearbook Online, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sipriyearbook.org/view/9780198737810/sipri-9780198737810-chapter-11-div1-10.xml\">IX.
