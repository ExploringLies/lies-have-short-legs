Joe Heck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reading a Reagan quote about rabbits and tigers, Angle&rsquo;s ad accuses Heck of aligning with Democrats a majority of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Congressman Joe Heck has been a D.C. rabbit for the past five years, voting 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues,&quot; Angle says in the ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is certainly a provocative shot with Nevada&rsquo;s primary election quickly approaching and Angle <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/276496-nevada-republican-enjoys-56-point-lead-on-primary-rival\">trailing in polls</a>, so we were interested in seeing just how often Heck ended up on the same side as the House&rsquo;s Democratic leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scoreboards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angle&rsquo;s campaign referred to Heck&rsquo;s 39 percent &quot;<a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/members/joe-heck/\">Liberty Score</a>&quot; ranking on the Conservative Review website as support for the ad. The group <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/liberty-score\">calculates the score</a> though 50 &quot;top&quot; votes through a rolling six-year window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website hasn&rsquo;t been Heck&rsquo;s biggest fan, with the site&rsquo;s editor-in-chief Mark Levin <a href=\"http://www.runsharronangle.com/mp3/levinangleendorsement.mp3\">endorsing Angle</a> and releasing a <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/05/meet-the-real-joe-heck\">video</a> saying he &quot;opposed conservative values on most issues of importance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, Brian Baluta, didn&rsquo;t comment on Conservative Review&rsquo;s rating but called the ad &quot;absurd on its face.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So under that narrow set of criteria, Heck and Pelosi (with an 11 percent Liberty Score) appear to have relatively similar positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Heck&rsquo;s overall voting record is nowhere close to being as aligned to Pelosi as the ad suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A CQ Roll Call query shows Heck and Pelosi voting together roughly 31 percent of the time since the Republican entered Congress in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage is even worse for the most recent congressional session &mdash; the two only matched up on 25 percent of roll call votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other conservative-leaning groups tend to rank Heck somewhere in the middle of Republican House members, with ranking Pelosi much lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heritage Action Fund, which grades congressional members on<a href=\"http://www.heritageactionscorecard.com/about\"> conservative votes, bill co-sponsorships and other legislative activity</a>, gives Heck a <a href=\"http://www.heritageactionscorecard.com/compare/compareHouseVotes?housemems=H001055_P000197&amp;senatemems=null&amp;cong=114\">53 percent rating</a> and Pelosi a <a href=\"http://www.heritageactionscorecard.com/compare/compareHouseVotes?housemems=H001055_P000197&amp;senatemems=null&amp;cong=114\">16 percent rating</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a similar tale with Club for Growth&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2015-House-online-detail-final.pdf\"> legislative scorecard</a>, which gives <a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/?party=0&amp;scyear=2015&amp;chamber=0&amp;state=0&amp;nm=heck&amp;submit=Search\">Heck</a> a 58 percent lifetime score and <a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/?party=0&amp;scyear=2015&amp;chamber=0&amp;state=0&amp;nm=pelosi&amp;submit=Search\">Pelosi</a> a measly 6 percent score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Conservative Union gives Heck a lifetime <a href=\"http://acuratings.conservative.org/acu-ratings-chart/?UID=877\">64 percent ranking</a> on their scorecard, while Pelosi has a lifetime <a href=\"http://acuratings.conservative.org/acu-ratings-chart/?UID=5496\">2.7 percent lifetime</a> ranking over her congressional career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad also shows several rabbits with Heck&rsquo;s face imposed, seeming to imply that Heck agrees with Pelosi on issues like gun control, Obamacare and amnesty for people not legally in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s also not the case, as a quick overview of Heck&rsquo;s record plants him squarely in the Republican orthodoxy on many of the issues that Angle&rsquo;s ad references.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Gun control: Heck has a strong pro-gun record &mdash; he&rsquo;s been endorsed by the National Rifle Association every time he&rsquo;s run for office, and he voted in favor of the only gun-related <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll852.xml\">legislation</a> considered by the Conservative Review.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Amnesty: Though it&rsquo;s somewhat of a loaded term, Heck has <a href=\"https://heck.house.gov/issues/immigration\">publicly stated support</a> for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. The Republican congressman has said he doesn&rsquo;t agree with presidential candidate Donald Trump&rsquo;s plan to deport the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Obamacare: Heck &mdash; a licensed physician &mdash; is generally opposed to the Affordable Care Act and has joined House Republicans in <a href=\"http://votesmart.org/candidate/44082/joe-heck-jr?categoryId=38&amp;type=V,S,R,E,F,P,E,E,E#.V1DIt_krKCh\">dozens of unsuccessful attempts</a> to repeal all or part of the law. Conservative Review only considers four votes related to health care, including bipartisan legislation increasing <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-veterans-health-care-bill\">Veteran&rsquo;s Administration</a> spending and an expansion of a <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr525\">grant program for veterinarians</a>.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Draft women: This claim is a bit more recent. Heck joined several Democrats in supporting a provision that would require women to begin <a href=\"http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2016/04/27/ndaa-hasc-women-draft/83624490/\">registering</a> with the Selective Service System for possible involuntary military service. The amendment was killed in a procedural maneuver in May, replaced with a <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/house-stands-down-on-women-in-the-draft\">requirement to study</a> future potential needs for a broader military draft system.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Angle ad claims Heck has voted 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the narrow parameters of the Conservative Review&rsquo;s &quot;Liberty Score,&quot; Heck and Pelosi do appear to share similar policy priorities. But that only takes into account 50 votes over a six-year period. Other conservative groups with legislative scorecards show a much wider gap between the two, and a review of their cumulative voting records shows a much larger gap in votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim is inaccurate.
