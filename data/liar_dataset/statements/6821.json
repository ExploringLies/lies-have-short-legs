Chris Christie offers these instructions: be fair to the Republican presidential nominee and get tough on President Barack Obama for not providing the specifics behind his own promises.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring an interview Sunday on NBC&rsquo;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; host David Gregory noted how Romney has failed to enumerate which tax deductions he would eliminate, and asked Christie whether Romney would provide those details during Wednesday&rsquo;s debate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe New Jersey governor argued that the media should be &quot;just as tough on the president&quot; for failing to explain how he would reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;He says he&rsquo;s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn&rsquo;t say how he&rsquo;s going to do it,&quot; Christie, a Republican, told Gregory. &quot;I mean, you know, let&rsquo;s be fair here.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe governor repeated that claim later in the interview, saying Obama &quot;puts out a nice two-minute ad that says he&rsquo;s going to reduce the debt by four trillion, but never tells us how.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOK, governor, let&rsquo;s be fair: you&rsquo;re wrong to claim Obama has not outlined his deficit reduction plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn an <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/jointcommitteereport.pdf\">80-page report</a> issued in September 2011 and again in the president&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/cutting.pdf\">budget proposal</a> released in February, the Obama administration has laid out detailed proposals and dollar amounts for how to achieve more than $4 trillion in savings over the next decade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe governor&rsquo;s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s explain some of those details.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nObama&rsquo;s deficit reduction plan relies on a mix of tax reductions for some, tax hikes for others and spending cuts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA large part of the savings would come from roughly $1.5 trillion worth of tax reform measures. For instance, the plan would allow federal income tax cuts to expire for upper-income taxpayers, while extending them for other Americans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe president&rsquo;s plan also would reduce certain tax deductions for upper-income taxpayers and close various tax loopholes, such as by ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many cases, the reform proposals are so specific that only tax policy wonks may really understand them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother roughly $850 billion in savings would come from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the president&rsquo;s budget. In addition, the deficit reduction plan accounts for roughly $1 trillion in spending cuts built into legislation signed by the president last year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Obama administration also has provided specific proposals for more than $500 billion in spending cuts and reforms to mandatory programs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose provisions include changes to Medicare and Medicaid; a reduction in certain agricultural subsidies; and a series of reforms within the U.S. Postal Service, such as reducing mail delivery from six days to five days per week.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, the president&rsquo;s plan has received both praise and criticism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Such a balanced approach -- both increases in revenues and reductions in spending -- is the only approach that will put the budget on an economically and politically sustainable path,&quot; wrote James R. Horney, vice president of Federal Fiscal Policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, said in a news release that &quot;the use of this war gimmick is quite troubling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Drawing down spending on wars that were already set to wind down and that were deficit financed in the first place should not be considered savings,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn an interview on NBC&rsquo;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Christie claimed Obama &quot;says he&rsquo;s gonna reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn&rsquo;t say how he&#39;s gonna do it.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the president has outlined in extensive detail how he would achieve more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. That plan has received mixed reviews, but it&rsquo;s ridiculous for Christie to suggest Obama has not provided such specific proposals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, governor, here&rsquo;s a fiery dose of fairness for you: Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d67054db-a2e9-4a49-b5a7-edc9ea760199\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d67054db-a2e9-4a49-b5a7-edc9ea760199</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/politifact_nj_chris_christie_s_7.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-03T15:40:45.388993", "ruling_date": "2012-10-04T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims Barack Obama has not outlined plan to reduce federal deficit by $4 trillion", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-barack-obama-has-not-outline", "ruling_link_text": "Detailed again and again", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM0GC5DbjRw\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.006079493438354566\">Chris Christie On Meet the Press</a>, a video posted on YouTube on Sept. 30, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49229399/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/september-chris-christie-david-plouffe-ralph-reed-ed-rendell-katty-kay-chuck-todd-richard-engel/#.UGnDXiJhVIw\">Meet the Press transcript</a>, Sept. 30, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/obama-says-budget-plan-cut-deficits-4-trillion/\">Obama says his budget plan will cut deficits by $4 trillion</a>, Sept. 7, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/barack-obama/mitt-romney-would-add-trillions-deficit-while-obam/\">Mitt Romney would add &quot;trillions&quot;
