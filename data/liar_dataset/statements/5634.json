Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat. &quot;And if you ask them where they live, they will say it&rsquo;s a security issue and I cannot reveal that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrrock was talking about Senate Bill 492, which is aimed at improving the state&rsquo;s purchasing process on construction projects. She wanted an amendment to the bill that would require the call center program be administered in the U.S.A.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We contract with a private corporation, and they promptly ship the jobs overseas to administer the program, the state program, in this case for food stamps, the state program is administered from foreign shores,&quot; Orrock said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, is this state program administered from foreign shores?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia&rsquo;s food stamp program, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is managed by the state&rsquo;s Department of Human Resources. The website has links to information in 11 languages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDHR spokeswoman Ravae Graham told PolitiFact Georgia that only 3 percent of the calls are handled overseas. Graham also sent us the most recent monthly call data. In February, 1.3 percent of the approximately 2.85 million calls were handled in India and Mexico. All the others were handled in this country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senator initially questioned the numbers in a telephone interview and asked for a few days to provide us information. A few days later, she sent us a report done in November by Channel 2 Action News that investigated the use of food stamp call centers outside the U.S. The report noted that 3 percent of those calls were handled overseas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrrock was interviewed in that report. She talked about her concerns that some of these calls were handled outside the U.S. &quot;rather than creating those jobs here, because we will be employing people who will then put their paycheck back into our economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrrock told us in a statement that she could have spoken more precisely. She said &quot;administered&quot; was a poor choice of words.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I am aware that the entire program is not delivered by people working overseas, and throughout my speech made reference to the call centers being delivered overseas,&quot; Orrock said in a statement. &quot;In speaking without prepared text perhaps I made a poor choice of words in saying administer, but my meaning was clear and I repeated several times that I was referring to the offshoring of call center jobs for the food stamp program, and not the administration of the entire food stamp program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Some of those call center services are delivered here, and my amendment was not aimed at those services,&quot; Orrock continued. &quot;The sole purpose of my amendment was to address the jobs offshored with Georgia taxpayer dollars.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrrock&rsquo;s amendment narrowly passed the Senate, but it was removed from the legislation when it came to the House of Representatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for our call on her claim, only a small percentage of those food stamp calls are handled outside the U.S. Her statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical factors, such as the 97 percent of calls handled here, that would give a different impression of someone unfamiliar with the program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder our rating system, Orrock gets a Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-27T16:08:25.673935", "ruling_date": "2012-03-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Details hurt Georgia lawmaker's claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "stats-hurt-georgia-lawmakers-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Call center claim gets poor reception", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGeorgia Public Broadcasting, Georgia Senate, Day 30, <a href=\"http://www.gpb.org/lawmakers/2012/day-30\">Part 1</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChannel 2 Action News investigative <a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/ga-taxpayers-funding-offshore-call-centers/nFc3s/\">report</a> on food stamp call centers, Nov. 14, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeorgia Senate Bill <a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20112012/SB/492\">492</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmails from Georgia Department of Human Resources spokeswoman Ravae Graham, March 9 and 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/327603-orrock-sb-492-politifact-rev.html\">Statement</a> from Georgia state Sen.
