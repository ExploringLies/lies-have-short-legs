During the final presidential debate in Oct. 19, Donald Trump said the group has spread significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton &quot;gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/19/the-final-trump-clinton-debate-transcript-annotated/\">Trump said</a>. &quot;And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place,&quot; Trump said later in the debate, &quot;and right now, they&#39;re in 32 countries.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&#39;ve noted before, Trump&#39;s claim that Clinton is responsible for ISIS rates&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-hillary-clinton-creati/\">False</a>. But we wanted to know if Trump&#39;s count of countries with an ISIS presence is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer: No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts we consulted said counts can vary depending on how you define whether ISIS has a serious presence in country. If you use a broad definition, Trump&#39;s count is probably too low. By a stricter definition, it&#39;s too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the Trump campaign for the source of the candidate&#39;s tally but we didn&#39;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where ISIS&#39;s impact is felt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Claims about ISIS (also known as the Islamic State, ISIL and Daesh) being in 32 countries seem to originate from <a href=\"http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/09/the_islamic_state_and_the_sham.php\">a blog post two years ago</a> on The Long War Journal website. The post described &quot;a partial list of reported or suspected ISIS/Islamic State activity outside Iraq and Syria since Jan. 1, 2013.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s a broad standard because it includes the United States and Canada, which are countries where ISIS has no known military presence. Additionally,&nbsp;it&#39;s not clear if any significant terror networks are operating in the United States or Canada, and many of the attacks that do occur seem to be coming from ISIS wannabes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Context is always key,&quot; said Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal and a senior fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.defenddemocracy.org/\">Foundation for Defense of Democracies</a>, a right-center think tank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a practical matter, Trump&#39;s count of 32 countries from 2014 would be out of date because ISIS&#39; strength has ebbed and flowed in various regions of the world, Roggio said. &quot;If Trump had said the Islamic State is operating in 32 countries to various degrees or had supporters in 32 states, the actual number is probably larger.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roggio said he could easily come up with a list of 37 countries, including countries where ISIS supporters have actually launched attacks &mdash; places like Spain, Canada and Italy, where officials claim to have broken up ISIS cells and arrested people. Some attacks have come from pre-existing terror networks that have pledged affiliation with ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roggio said it&#39;s legitimate to include countries where self-declared supporters have launched attacks because &quot;that&#39;s exactly what the Islamic State and al-Qaida tell people to do. To me, we wouldn&#39;t refrain from calling out someone who identifies as a Nazi or a KKK member just because they didn&#39;t sign the membership rolls somewhere.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another source, the National Counterterrorism Center has listed ISIS attacks, big and small,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-05-1470406847-6752702-ISILattacksglobal.jpg\">in 27 countries</a> between September 2014 and June 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/b5M3Rc06XL31HsY-dTycOxpxeEeH8pRcr9uEBxfojd-I5GO7y1hzjLAn75ZVpFETaBgaFzunPhsfpvLnHtTzRJsDJwWKGjNkqfu0Is9WabEwzMkvUPC90ZmZSzr-yJgu391YI3Yb\" style=\"height:356px; width:624px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trevor Thrall, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed us to <a href=\"https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_IslamicStateTerrorismPatterns_BackgroundReport_Aug2016.pdf\">data</a> from the University of Maryland&#39;s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism reporting that in 2015, ISIS-related terrorist attacks took place in 33 countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is not quite the same, of course, as saying ISIL is &#39;in&#39; 33 countries. Many of those attacks &mdash; most of those occurring outside Iraq in particular &mdash;- were conducted by lone wolves or by ISIL affiliated groups, not ISIL per se,&quot; Thrall said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/17/world/mapping-isis-attacks-around-the-world/\">CNN&#39;s running tally</a> lists attacks in 31 countries, including Iraq and Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strong physical presence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the narrow standard, where some sort of military presence &mdash; or at least an established network &mdash; is required, Trump&#39;s count is too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R43612.pdf\">June 2016 Congressional Research Service report</a> identified nine countries where ISIS had a serious presence.
