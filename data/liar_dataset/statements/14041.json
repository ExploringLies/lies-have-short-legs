The thread comprised of approximately 100 tweets, with each tweet representing one way that the Trump administration has harmed women and families.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most tweets criticized Trump&rsquo;s policies, but some took aim at the administration itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like No. 57.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Trump&#39;s Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s,&quot; reads the tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This made us wonder. Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long story short, this claim is accurate when you compare the percentage&nbsp;of nonwhite males&nbsp;and women combined to the percentage of white males in each cabinet. However, if you look at each factor separately, Trump&#39;s cabinet remains the most white, but not the most male. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The president&rsquo;s first cabinets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidence of this claim, the Center for American Progress&rsquo; tweet linked to a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/13/us/politics/trump-cabinet-women-minorities.html?_r=1\">article</a> that reached a similar conclusion about Trump&rsquo;s first cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<em> New York Times</em> story was updated on March 10, 2017, and compares Trump&rsquo;s first cabinet to the first cabinets of former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and of course Ronald Reagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The analysis was first written when Trump&rsquo;s cabinet wasn&rsquo;t fully assembled, so, it assumes Trump&rsquo;s remaining nominees would be confirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York&nbsp;Times</em> included R. Alexander Acosta, Trump&rsquo;s second nominee for labor secretary, and to the best of our knowledge Trump&rsquo;s cabinet has remained unchanged since this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the <em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;analysis included traditional cabinet positions as well as &quot;cabinet-level&quot; positions. Cabinet-level positions have changed over time. (Trump has 24 cabinet members, whereas George H.W. Bush only had 17).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some positions, such as the United Nations ambassador and the Office of Management and Budget director, are given cabinet-level rank by individual presidents but are not traditionally considered part of the cabinet,&quot; the article says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, some traditional cabinet positions were created since Reagan took office. For example, the Department of Homeland Security didn&rsquo;t get created until 2003 and the Department of Veterans Affairs did not exist in its current form until George H.W.&nbsp;Bush&rsquo;s presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For these reasons, the total number of people in each president&rsquo;s first cabinet varies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with those factors in mind, how white and male is Trump&rsquo;s cabinet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <em>New York Times</em>, 18 of Trump&#39;s 24 cabinet members are white males.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only minorities and women in Trump&rsquo;s cabinet are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Elaine L. Chao, transportation secretary;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Betsy DeVos, education secretary;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nikki R. Haley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Linda McMahon, administrator of the Small Business Administration;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Ben Carson, housing and urban development secretary; and,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; R. Alexander Acosta, labor secretary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means 75 percent of Trump&rsquo;s first cabinet is white males.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A smaller percentage of white males were in Obama&rsquo;s, W. Bush&rsquo;s and Clinton&rsquo;s first cabinets based on the same analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The only other president who challenges Trump&rsquo;s standing is George H.W. Bush, whose first cabinet was 71 percent white male. But Bush had fewer cabinet members, according to the <em>New York&nbsp;</em><em>Times&#39;</em> article. So, the percentage of nonwhite and women cabinet members combined in his cabinet is higher than Trump&rsquo;s cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But looking at each demographic&nbsp;individually &mdash; white and male &mdash; changes the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&#39;s cabinet has a higer percentage of&nbsp;white males out of any first cabinet since Reagan, but he does not have the highest percentage of&nbsp;males.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That distinction belongs to George H.W. Bush whose cabinet was&nbsp;89 percent male. Females makes up a little more than 16 percent of Trump&rsquo;s cabinet, but only made&nbsp;up 11 percent of George H.W. Bush&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to go back to Reagan to find a more white and more male cabinet. White males comprised 90 percent of his first cabinet. (It&#39;s worth noting Reagan had 17 white males to Trump&#39;s 18. Reagan&#39;s cabinet is considered less diverse, though, because he had even less people in his cabinet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that Trump&rsquo;s cabinet lacks diversity has been widely reported on, especially when confirmation hearings and appointments were being made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During that time, a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/13/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-diversity/\">CNN report</a> noted that Trump&#39;s four most influential departments are led by white males, which is a first since George H.W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those include former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson (secretary of state), retired Marine Gen. James Mattis (secretary of defense), Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (attorney general), and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin (secretary of the treasury).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a tweet, American Progress said, &quot;Trump&#39;s Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That claim is based on a credible <em>New York Times</em> analysis that found that Trump&rsquo;s first cabinet had a smaller percentage of women and nonwhites combined than any president since Reagan. When you look at each demographic separately, however, George H.W. Bush has the&nbsp;most male cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-26T08:52:08.086423", "ruling_date": "2017-04-26T11:18:04", "ruling_headline": "Is Trump's Cabinet more white and male than any first cabinet since Reagan?", "ruling_headline_slug": "true-trumps-cabinet-more-white-and-more-male-any-f", "ruling_link_text": "Counting up cabinet members", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>American Progress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amprog/status/856929660441178113\">tweet</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/13/us/politics/trump-cabinet-women-minorities.html?_r=2\">New York Times</a>, &quot;Trump&rsquo;s Cabinet So Far Is More White and Male Than Any First Cabinet Since Reagan&rsquo;s,&quot; Updated March 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2017/01/trumps-cabinet-by-the-numbers-234117\">Politico</a>, &quot;Trump&rsquo;s Cabinet by the numbers: White, wealthy and light on women,&quot; Jan. 24</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/cabinet-diversity-impact-policy-making/\">PBS NewsHour</a>, &quot;Trump&rsquo;s cabinet is mostly white and male.
