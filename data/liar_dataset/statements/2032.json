In a July 7, 2010, appearance on MSNBC&#39;s <em>The Dylan Ratigan Show</em>, U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., made clear that he feels the richest Americans pay too much.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt one point in the interview, Cenk Uygur, the host filling in for Ratigan, asked Franks, &quot;So, Congressman, if we can&#39;t cut defense spending and you don&#39;t want to raise taxes on the wealthy, where are you going to get your savings from, the poor and the middle class? Is that right?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFranks responded, &quot;No, the fact is, you know, when you&#39;re always talking about raising taxes on the rich, I think the top -- the rich now, the top 1 percent, pay over half of the entire revenue for this country. And you don&#39;t realize that if you destroy those who have capital, you absolutely devastate those that are trying to get jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&#39;t take sides in the argument over the best tax policy, but we do think it&#39;s worth checking his statistic that &quot;the top 1 percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found three problems with Franks&#39; statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t1. When it comes to the federal income tax (which is only one of many taxes -- more on that later) Frank&#39;s &quot;over half&quot; estimate is high. According to IRS statistics from the 2007 tax year, the last year available,&nbsp;slightly more than 40 percent of federal income taxes are paid by the top 1 percent. (For that year, it took an adjusted gross income of $410,096 to make it into that elite 1 percent.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t2. The federal income tax isn&#39;t the only tax levied by the federal government. It is the biggest when measured by revenue generated, but it doesn&#39;t even account for more than half of all federal tax revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe income tax generates 45 percent of federal tax revenue, followed by 36 percent for payroll taxes, 12 percent for corporate income taxes, 3 percent for excise taxes and 4 percent for other taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t3. Tax revenues aren&#39;t the only form of revenues that fund the government. As we reported in an <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/06/darrell-issa/issa-says-oil-royalties-trail-only-taxes-generalti/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"earlier item\">earlier item</a>, the federal government also collects fees&nbsp;paid to various agencies.&nbsp;In 2009, for example,&nbsp;the government took in the following:&nbsp;the U.S. Postal Service ($69 billion), Medicare premiums ($57 billion), deposits with the Federal Reserve Board ($34.3 billion), customs duties ($21.3 billion), Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. premiums and recoveries ($20.5 billion), auction proceeds from electromagnetic spectrum rights ($16.7 billion), energy sales by the Tennessee Valley Authority ($11.1 billion), natural resources royalties and revenues ($9.9 billion).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTogether, these non-tax collections totaled $240 billion, an amount roughly equal to 10 percent of what taxes bring in -- which is more than pocket change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo are there better yardsticks? There are.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution found that in 2009, the top 1 percent shouldered the burden for roughly 23 percent of all federal taxes. To get to the level Franks&#39; cited -- &quot;over half&quot; -- you have to increase the window from 1 percent to 10 percent. That is, the top 10 percent of American earners paid for 52 percent of all federal taxes that year, according to the Tax Policy Center. A big reason for the difference is that the top 1 percent pay 5 percent or less of payroll and excise taxes. (They also pay more than 50 percent of corporate income taxes and more than 70 percent of estate taxes.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;ll grant that Franks&#39; statement was an off-the-cuff response to a question during a television interview. We&#39;ll also acknowledge that the top 1 percent of taxpayers does pay a disproportionate share of taxes generally. Even at 23 percent of the total federal tax burden, that&#39;s a lot bigger than their share of the population, and also bigger than their share of income (16 percent). That&#39;s the nature of a progressive tax system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, it&#39;s worth noting that the share being paid by the top 1 percent has generally risen over time. In 1987, the first year after President Ronald Reagan signed a sweeping tax reform bill, the share paid by the top 1 percent stood slightly above 16 percent. The top one-fifth of the population -- what one might call, in Franks&#39; words, &quot;the rich&quot; -- is the only fifth, or &quot;quintile,&quot; of the population that has seen its share of the tax burden go up during that time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, we can&#39;t brush off the inaccuracies in Franks&#39; statement. He makes it sound as if the top 1 percent of the country is shouldering more than half of the burden of funding the federal government, when in fact it&#39;s about half that. In addition, the top 1 percent are not even shouldering half of the burden of the income tax by itself. We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-09T16:23:15.026177", "ruling_date": "2010-07-09T16:20:29", "ruling_headline": "Trent Franks says top 1 percent pays over half of the entire revenue for U.S.", "ruling_headline_slug": "trent-franks-says-top-1-percent-pays-over-half-ent", "ruling_link_text": "Incorrect on several levels", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTrent Franks, interview on MSNBC&#39;s The Dylan Ratigan Show, July 7, 2010 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, &quot;The <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/numbers/revenue.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Numbers: What Are the Federal Government&rsquo;s Sources of Revenue</a>?&quot; accessed July 9. 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html\" target=\"_blank\">Summary of Latest Federal Individual Income Tax Data</a>,&quot; July 30, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Taxpayers Union, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/who-pays-income-taxes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Who Pays Income Taxes and How Much</a>?&quot; accessed July 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=2433\" target=\"_blank\">Share of Federal Taxes Under Current Law, by Cash Income Percentile, 2009</a>,&quot; Aug. 24, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;Shares of Federal Tax Liabilities for All Households, by Comprehensive Household Income Quintile, 1979-2007&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publications/collections/tax/2010/tax_liability_shares.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">table</a>), accessed July 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Bob Williams, senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, July 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Gillian Brunet, research assistant at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, July 9, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tE-mail interview with Natasha Altamirano, Tax Foundation spokesperson, July 9. 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Trent", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Arizona", "id": 510, "last_name": "Franks", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "trent-franks", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Franks_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/510/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://franks.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;The top 1 percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on MSNBC's 'The Dylan Ratigan Show'", "statement_date": "2010-07-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
