Wendy Davis of Fort Worth opposed the mandate adopted by the 2011 Legislature requiring most Texas voters to present a photo ID at the polls. She was among Democrats who argued that the hurdle attacked non-existent fraud and would disproportionately affect lower-income and minority populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Sept. 19, 2014, gubernatorial debate, Davis broadened her criticism of voter ID -- and her opponent Greg Abbott&rsquo;s support for it &mdash; by saying that Abbott&rsquo;s party fully objects to the <a href=\"http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Voting Rights Act of 1965</u></a>, which was signed into law when Texan Lyndon B. Johnson was president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, the law took aim at methods used to prevent African Americans from voting. The act specified that no &quot;tests or devices&quot; could be placed between citizens and their ballots, spelling out examples such as literacy tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 5 required certain jurisdictions -- states or smaller political entities that had recently employed such methods and had less than 50 percent voter participation or registration in the last presidential election -- to get federal approval before changing election laws. But this element <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>was invalidated in 2013 </u></a>by the U.S. Supreme Court with Abbott among state attorneys general urging the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate, Davis said Abbott &quot;heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is all that so?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis is right about the platform adopted by delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in June 2014, which says: &quot;We urge that the Voter Rights Act of 1965, codified and updated in 1973, be repealed and not reauthorized.&quot; That provision appears, though, after another entry: &quot;We support equal suffrage for all United States citizens of voting age who are not felons.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar declarations -- favoring voting rights for non-felons and repeal of the Voting Rights Act -- appeared in the party&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012Platform_Final.docx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2012 platform</u></a>. But the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGZzVSTlNJZVdmeG8/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>platform</u></a> adopted by delegates to the party&rsquo;s 2010 convention didn&rsquo;t have the call to repeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see how a governor could be viewed as helming her or his political party. But the Republican Party in Texas is chaired by Steve Munisteri, a lawyer repeatedly elected by convention delegates to the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while we found no news reports on Abbott backing or opposing the 2014 repeal plank, a June 2014 news story in the <em>San Antonio Express-News</em>, quoted Munisteri saying generally: &quot;It&#39;s not the Greg Abbott platform. He has his own platform.&quot; Abbott campaign spokesman Avdiel Huerta then said Abbott&rsquo;s platform stresses jobs, education, roads, water and securing the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our inquiries about whether Abbott personally favors repeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis said Abbott &quot;heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim is accurate about the state party platform. But Abbott may or may not support repeal; he also isn&rsquo;t his party&rsquo;s chief, though it&rsquo;s fair to suggest any governor has a role in guiding his or her state party.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong> </em><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-23T19:35:56.363728", "ruling_date": "2014-09-24T11:20:31", "ruling_headline": "Wendy Davis says Republican Party of Texas platform calls for repeal of Voting Rights Act", "ruling_headline_slug": "wendy-davis-says-republican-party-texas-platform-c", "ruling_link_text": "Unknown if Abbott agrees", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?321547-1/texas-governors-debate\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Video</u></a> of the debate between Democrat Wendy Davis and Republican Greg Abbott, the Edinburg Conference Center at Renaissance, Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, sponsored by the McAllen<em> Monitor, </em>KGBT-TV and KTLM-TV, Sept. 19, 2014 (posted online by C-SPAN)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documents, <a href=\"http://www.texasgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-Platform-Final.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Republican Party of Texas Report of Permanent Committee on Platform and Resolutions As A mended and A dopted by the 2014 State Convention of the Republican Party of Texas,&quot;</u></a> June 2014; <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012Platform_Final.docx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;2012 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF TEXAS &nbsp;Report of Platform Committee,&quot;</u></a> June 2012; <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGZzVSTlNJZVdmeG8/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;2010 STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORM,&quot;</u></a> June 2010 (2010 platform received by email from Spencer Yeldell, communications director, Republican Party of Texas, Sept. 22, 2014)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News story, &quot;New platform is causing rifts in Texas GOP,&quot; <em>San Antonio Express-News</em>, June 11, 2014 (Nexis search)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "state senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Wendy", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 550, "last_name": "Davis", "mostly_true_count": 12, "name_slug": "wendy-davis", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/davis.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/550/", "total_count": 27, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/members/dist10/dist10.htm"}, "statement": "<p>Greg Abbott &quot;heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate in the Rio Grande Valley.", "statement_date": "2014-09-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 117, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/117/", "subject": "Civil Rights", "subject_slug": "civil-rights", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
