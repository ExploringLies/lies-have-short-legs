At the time, Trump was part-owner of the pageant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next morning, Trump criticized Machado during a Fox and Friends interview. And Trump eventually brought the feud to Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second debate on Oct. 9, Cooper cited the tweet in a question about whether Trump has the right temperament to be president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;Is that the discipline of a good president?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump responded, &quot;No, it wasn&rsquo;t saying, &lsquo;check out a sex tape.&rsquo; It was just &lsquo;take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful girl scout, who was no girl scout.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what Trump wanted people to read into it.
