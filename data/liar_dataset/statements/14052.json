Facebook users, federal judges and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were all prepared to fight any executive order, but Trump didn&rsquo;t care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Inside, we both know what&rsquo;s been going on. We know the game and we&rsquo;re gonna play it,&quot; Trump is quoted in the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, we know that this is a faker than fake quote, because it&rsquo;s a line from <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tgw2cwodk4yi4nuk2cljfj7udqy?lyrics=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=lyrics&amp;pcampaignid=kp-lyrics\">Rick Astley&rsquo;s <em>Never Gonna Give You Up</em></a>.
