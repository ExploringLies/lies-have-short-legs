And there would likely be a post about it in press releases of the <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/press-releases\">official website</a> of the British Royal family (which is teeming with news about the birth of Prince Louis and the impending nuptials of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, on the same day this hoax published, the queen <a href=\"http://time.com/5271758/queen-elizabeth-horses-photos/\">was actually at the Royal Windsor Horse Show</a> where she was pictured smiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the queen does pass away, it will be the &quot;most disruptive event in Britain in the last 70 years,&quot; according to Business Insider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For at least 12 days &mdash; between her passing, the funeral and beyond &mdash; Britain will grind to a halt,&quot; the article <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/what-happens-when-queen-elizabeth-ii-dies-2015-3\">said</a>. &quot;It&#39;ll cost the British economy billions in lost earnings.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was one recent death in the royal family: the queen&rsquo;s dog, Willow. Willow, the 14-year old corgi <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/europe/queen-last-corgi-dead-intl/index.html\">was put down</a> in April following a battle with cancer.
