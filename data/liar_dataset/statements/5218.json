If we were a cat, our ears would be lowered and our head down. If we were a dog, we&rsquo;d be looking up at you with sad dog eyes. You get the picture.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast week we ruled True a statement by the Oregon Republican Party that Republican Rob Cornilles had the endorsements of a variety of local mayors, including Democrat, Republican and Independent. The upper case &quot;I&quot; means he had the backing of a registered member of the Independent Party of Oregon, which is a third party group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, we were wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked Cornilles&rsquo; list of <a href=\"http://www.cornillesforcongress.com/endorsements/\">mayors</a><a href=\"http://www.cornillesforcongress.com/endorsements/\"> online</a>, and confirmed their party registration. As we suspected, most are Republican. But we found six non-Republicans, including three registered Democrats.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe originally emailed Amity Mayor Michael Cape and asked him if he was registered with the Independent Party, as opposed to being a non-affiliated voter. He said yes. But it turns out that he&rsquo;s actually a non-affiliated voter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.indparty.com/about\">Independent Party of Oregon </a>was officially recognized by the Secretary of State in January 2007. Previously, people registered with no party could call themselves independent voters. Now they best stick to calling themselves non-affiliated voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCape said in a later interview that he considered himself independent, as in neither Republican nor Democratic. This is a confusing issue. When we first contacted the Yamhill clerk&rsquo;s office, a person there said Cape was registered as Other-Independent. Which is not the same as registering with the Independent Party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHad the Oregon Republican Party used a lower case &quot;i&quot; they would have been accurate. They say that&rsquo;s what they intended all along. But capitalization makes a difference. We&rsquo;re very sorry for the confusion but facts are facts. We change our previous ruling from a True to a False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/01/does_rob_cornilles_have_the_su.html\">Go back to OregonLive to comment.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-23T20:22:59.964077", "ruling_date": "2012-01-23T17:16:33", "ruling_headline": "RULING CHANGE: Has Rob Cornilles locked up endorsements from Independent, Democratic and Republican mayors?", "ruling_headline_slug": "ruling-change-has-rob-cornilles-locked-endorsement", "ruling_link_text": "He does NOT have a bonafide Independent on his side", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCornilles for Congress, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cornillesforcongress.com/endorsements/\">Endorsements</a>&quot;<br />\r\n\tEmails from Michael Cape, Jan. 17, 2012 &nbsp;<br />\r\n\tInterview with Michael Cape, Jan. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\tInterview with Rebekah Stern Doll, Yamhill County Elections Clerk, Jan. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\tEmails from Dan Meek, Independent Party of Oregon, Jan. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\tInterview with Greg Leo, Oregon Republican Party, Jan. 20, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1649, "last_name": "Oregon Republican Party", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "oregon-republican-party", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Behle_in_oregon_elephant_-_email.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1649/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.oregonrepublicanparty.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tRob Cornilles has been endorsed by 20 local mayors, including Independent, Democratic and Republican.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign mailer", "statement_date": "2012-01-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 149, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/149/", "subject": "Bipartisanship", "subject_slug": "bipartisanship", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
