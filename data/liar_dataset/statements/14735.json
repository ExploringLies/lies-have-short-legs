Some will see an increase, perhaps because of changes in the bill that scale back the mortgage-interest deduction or the state and local tax deduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Decoding the tax changes</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The committee&rsquo;s analysis projects that, between 2019 and 2022, the Republican tax bill would cut taxes for each of the 11 income ranges into which it breaks down taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the smaller end, those earning less than $10,000 would see a cumulative tax decrease of $557 million for 2019. On the larger side, those earning more than $1 million would see a cumulative tax decrease of almost $41.6 billion for 2019. Here&rsquo;s the full table:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting two important caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The tax cuts eventually disappear for some income groups</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The joint committee found that by 2023, the tax cuts would disappear for groups with modest incomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, those earning under $10,000 would see their taxes rise by a cumulative $100 million; those earning between $10,000 and $20,000 would see taxes rise by $638 million; those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see taxes rise by almost $1.2 billion; and those earning between $30,000 and $40,000 would see taxes rise by $653 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a sense of scale, households with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 or below account for somewhere around half of households, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/income-breaks-distribution-tables-nov-2016/t16-0267-income-breaks-2016-tax-model\">according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The analysis doesn&rsquo;t mean that every single taxpayer will get a tax cut</div>\r\n\r\n<p>These 2019 cuts show the general pattern for all income groups, but shouldn&rsquo;t be taken as gospel for every individual taxpayer and family. The figures just mean that, when all the individual cuts and increases are added up, they cumulatively produce a decrease. However, some percentage of individuals in each income group may face higher taxes right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Taxes go down on average for each income group in 2019, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that taxes go down for every single household,&quot; said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One backer of the tax bill, Grover Norquist, explained this phenomenon more accurately when he wrote a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/grover-norquist-dont-believe-the-lies-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-cuts-taxes-for-everyone/article/2639894\">column</a> in the <em>Washington Examiner</em>. The headline of his article refers to how the bill &quot;cuts taxes for all income levels.&quot; McCarthy didn&rsquo;t word it that carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how many Americans could face tax increases under the GOP bill? Two days after McCarthy&rsquo;s comment on Face the Nation, the Joint Committee on Taxation <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/TAX.pdf\">released data</a> that provides us with a better idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all income groups in 2019, the committee found that 61 percent would see a tax decrease of at least $100. Another 31 percent would see a tax change of less than $100 in either direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves 8 percent of tax filers seeing a tax increase of at least $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, while most Americans would indeed see a tax cut or a minor increase in the first year, 8 percent, or roughly 14 million American households, would see an increase of at least $100. (We approximated the raw number using <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-nov-2017/t17-0236-chairmans-amendment-nature-substitute-hr-1\">Tax Policy Center data</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the number of Americans facing a tax increase would grow over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2027, 46 percent would see a decrease and 34 percent would see a change of less than $100, but 20 percent would see a tax increase. That could mean close to 40 million Americans would pay higher taxes in 2027 than they would under today&rsquo;s tax laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/preliminary-distributional-analysis-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/full\">Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s own analysis</a> largely echoed what the joint committee found. In 2018, 7.3 percent of taxpayers would see a tax increase in 2018. By 2027, that percentage would rise to 26 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked with McCarthy&rsquo;s office, they didn&rsquo;t back away from his previous phrasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This plan reduces tax rates for every American, delivering immediate relief on income taxes on income above the standard deduction,&quot; said spokesman Matt Sparks. &quot;And throughout their lives, this bill will let every American keep more of what they earn because the deductions, preferences, and carve-outs that are being eliminated are available to taxpayers in only a small number of years, while the benefit of lower rates and higher standard deduction are available to everyone, every year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>McCarthy said the Republican tax bill &quot;lets every American keep more of what they earned.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the Joint Committee on Taxation&#39;s analysis, the tax bill does, on average, produce tax cuts for each of the 11 income groups it studied. But that&rsquo;s not what McCarthy repeatedly said -- that it would produce a tax cut for &quot;every American.&quot; Individual taxpayers&rsquo; situations will be affected differently by provisions in the bill, and for 2018 alone, the committee found that 8 percent of taxpayers would pay more in taxes. That translates to millions of Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-09T13:05:48.458128", "ruling_date": "2017-11-09T15:31:13", "ruling_headline": "Will 'every American' get a tax cut from House GOP bill?", "ruling_headline_slug": "will-every-american-get-tax-cut-house-gop-bill", "ruling_link_text": "Millions projected to see tax hikes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Kevin McCarthy, <em><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-house-majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-on-face-the-nation-nov-5-2017/\">comments on CBS&rsquo;
