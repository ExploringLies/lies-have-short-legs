The program is hosted by <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/john-oliver/\">John Oliver</a>, who used to be a correspondent for &quot;The Daily Show with <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/jon-stewart/\">Jon Stewart</a>&quot; on Comedy Central.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opening the segment by noting &quot;we are finally in an election year,&quot; Oliver talked about voting in America -- in particular, identification requirements for voting. (The show happened to air two days before Wisconsin&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/369095521.html\">primary election</a>, when voters cast ballots for the a state Supreme Court seat and a variety of local offices.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several minutes later, Wisconsin and a few other states, along with Sauk City (<a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml?src=bkmk\">pop. 3,410</a>), were singled out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And in some parts of the country, the offices that issue IDs are hardly ever open,&quot; an incredulous Oliver said. &quot;In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Democracy/VRE/Challenge_of_Obtaining_Voter_ID.pdf\">a study</a> found that in Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi, fewer than half of all ID-issuing offices in the state are open five days a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And in Sauk City, Wisconsin,&quot; Oliver continued, &quot;the ID office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month -- and only four months in 2016 even have five Wednesdays.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oliver&rsquo;s Sauk City claim later got online attention from <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/2/15/10995512/john-oliver-voter-id\">Vox</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/141900-john-oliver-claims-voting-rights-are-seriously-at-risk-in-a-blazing-last-week-tonight-premiere\">Bustle</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A graphic that flashed on the screen during Oliver&rsquo;s monologue carried a screenshot of a website page that listed the hours of operation for a state Division of Motor Vehicles office in Sauk City. That appeared to back up Oliver&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Oliver&rsquo;s claim could leave the impression that the only place Sauk City residents can get an ID for voting is at an office that&rsquo;s open only on fifth Wednesdays, as in four days for all of 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Voter ID law</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, Republican Gov. Scott Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/122588869.html\">signed a bill</a> that <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/adelmanorder.pdf\">requires</a> residents to present a photo identification in order to vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law was used for the first time in the February 2012 primary election. But after that, the law was put on ice while it was challenged in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, the challenge reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear it. That meant the law was put back into effect. The <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/voter-id-will-get-test-as-primary-features-key-local-statewide-races-b99670565z1-368861951.html\">first time</a> it was used again was in the primary held two days after Oliver made his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oliver&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear that Wisconsin <a href=\"http://bringit.wi.gov/do-i-have-right-photo-id\">has no &quot;voter ID.&quot;</a> Rather, under the voter ID law, Wisconsin voters must present an existing ID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://bringit.wi.gov/do-i-have-right-photo-id\">one of these:</a> drivers license; state-issued ID (often in lieu of a drivers license); a military ID card issued by a U.S. uniformed service; a U.S. passport; or an identification card issued by a federally recognized Indian tribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a drivers licensed or state-issued ID, residents are <a href=\"http://bringit.wi.gov/how-do-i-get-free-state-id-card\">directed to</a> the state Division of Motor Vehicles. You <a href=\"http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/dmv/license-drvs/how-to-apply/petition-process.aspx\">need to go</a> to a DMV customer service center, fill out two forms and present documents (such as a marriage certificate) to prove <a href=\"http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/dmv/license-drvs/how-to-apply/identity.aspx\">your identity</a>, as well as documents (such as a pay stub, a utility bill or a bank statement) to prove you&rsquo;re a <a href=\"http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/dmv/license-drvs/how-to-apply/residency.aspx\">Wisconsin resident</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you&rsquo;re in Sauk City, which is about 30 miles northwest of Madison, how do you find the nearest DMV office?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went to the DMV&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/online-srvcs/find-dmv/default.aspx#cities\">online locator</a> for DMV offices by city and chose the <a href=\"https://trust.dot.state.wi.us/cscfinder/cityCountySearch.do?city=Sauk%20City\">listing for Sauk City</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That DMV service center is inside the Sauk City Community Center. And, sure enough, as Oliver&rsquo;s piece stated, it&rsquo;s open only on the fifth Wednesday of every month, from 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DMV doesn&rsquo;t list the actual dates, so we looked them up. The four <a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?country=1\">fifth Wednesdays</a> in 2016 are in, as Oliver noted, March, June, August and November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Oliver even offered a clever rhyme to remember when the fifth Wednesdays fall, but it&rsquo;s a little profane.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of DMV locations relatively nearby, however, are open more often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one <a href=\"https://trust.dot.state.wi.us/cscfinder/cityCountySearch.do?city=Baraboo\">in Baraboo</a> (home to <a href=\"http://www.circusworldbaraboo.org/\">Circus World</a>), about 20 miles away, is open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays. The one <a href=\"https://trust.dot.state.wi.us/cscfinder/cityCountySearch.do?city=Reedsburg\">in Reedsburg</a> (<a href=\"http://www.reedsburgwi.gov/\">&quot;fastest available&quot;</a> Internet speeds in Wisconsin), about 30 miles away, is open the first, second and third Wednesday of each month from 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in Madison, the nearest major city, there are <a href=\"https://trust.dot.state.wi.us/cscfinder/cityCountySearch.do?city=Madison\">three DMV facilities</a> that are open even more during the week, plus Saturday mornings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, Sauk City isn&#39;t the only small town where DMV hours are limited, but no DMV site is open less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oliver said that in Sauk City, Wis., &quot;the ID office&quot; that provides identification for voting &quot;is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month&quot; -- a total of four days in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s correct that the state DMV office in Sauk City is only open on those four days in 2016, but that isn&rsquo;t the only place where residents can go to get a state ID that they can use for voting. Several other locations within a relatively short drive of Sauk City are open much more often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-18T17:18:42.035682", "ruling_date": "2016-02-19T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Office that provides ID for voting in one Wisconsin burg is open 4 days in 2016, John Oliver says", "ruling_headline_slug": "office-provides-id-voting-one-wisconsin-burg-open-", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but there are other options", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHFOwlMCdto\">&quot;Last Week Tonight (4:40),&quot;</a> Feb. 14, 2016 &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, HBO spokeswoman Tobe Becker, Feb. 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Wisconsin Department of Transportation spokeswoman Patricia Mayers, Feb. 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Wisconsin Government Accountability Board spokesman Reid Magney, Feb. 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brennan Center for Justice, <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Democracy/VRE/Challenge_of_Obtaining_Voter_ID.pdf\">&quot;The Challenge of Obtaining Voter Identification,&quot;</a> July 29, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, <a href=\"http://bringit.wi.gov/do-i-have-right-photo-id\">&quot;Bring it to the ballot,&quot;</a> accessed Feb. 17, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Host, Last Week Tonight", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 1009, "last_name": "Oliver", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-oliver", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/John-Oliver-of-Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver_event_main.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1009/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver"}, "statement": "<p>In Sauk City, Wisconsin, &quot;the ID office&quot; that provides identification for voting &quot;is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month&quot; -- a total of four days in 2016.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV show", "statement_date": "2016-02-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 117, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/117/", "subject": "Civil Rights", "subject_slug": "civil-rights", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
