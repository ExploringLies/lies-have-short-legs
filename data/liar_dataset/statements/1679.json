It says that the United States will not develop new nuclear  warheads, that programs to extend the life of the existing arsenal would rely on  previously tested designs, and that the United States will not support new nuclear  military capabilities.<br /><br />That's a break from the policy of George W. Bush, who  proposed new nuclear warheads that would be longer-lasting, reliable and provide  greater flexibility to ultimately reduce the nation's nuclear stockpile. <br /><br />On ABC's <em>This Week</em> on  April 11, 2010, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the policy objectives of the  two administrations are not that different.<br /><br />\"The reliable replacement warhead program that existed  in the past was really a means to an end,\" said Gates, who served in the same  job for President Bush. \"It was a means to modernizing the nuclear stockpile ...  making it more reliable, safer, and more secure. The policy of the Bush  administration was also not to add new nuclear capabilities. This was about how  do you make the stockpile safer and more reliable.\"<br /><br />President Barack Obama's Nuclear  Posture Review outlines a plan to modernize the existing nuclear arsenal without  creating new warheads. If replacement of nuclear components is deemed critically  necessary, the Pentagon would need the okay of the president and Congress. Gates  said that plan \"offers us a path forward, as Secretary Clinton says, in terms of  reuse, refurbishment, and -- and if necessary, replacement of components. Not an  entire warhead necessarily. So the chiefs, and I and the directors of the  nuclear labs are all very comfortable this puts us in a position to modernize  the stockpile.\"<br /><br />Here, we are focusing on Gates' claim that, \"The  policy of the Bush administration was also not to add new nuclear  capabilities.\"<br /><br />That  may be how the Bush policy ended up, but early on Bush championed a plan to  develop a nuclear \"bunker-buster\" weapon.<br /><br />Bush's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review report stated that  \"a need may arise to modify, upgrade, or replace portions of the extant nuclear  force or develop concepts for follow-on nuclear weapons better suited to the  nation's needs.\" Specifically, the report talks about the need to develop  weapons to get at a growing number of \"hard and deeply-buried targets.\"<br /><br />That led to Bush  administration proposals in 2003 and 2004 to modify existing warheads to develop  a nuclear \"bunker buster\" -- formally known as the \"Robust Nuclear Earth  Penetrator\" -- that would use a nuclear warhead to destroy underground  targets.<br /><br />But  Congress repeatedly balked, and the nuclear weapon was never built. Obama, we  note, was among those who voted against the program in 2005.<br /><br />\"Congress basically  said, 'No, you can't have it,' \" Darryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms  Control Association, told PolitiFact.<br /><br />The Bush policy then evolved toward modernizing the  arsenal without adding to the U.S. nuclear capability. Bush proposed the  Reliable Replacement Warhead Program, which sought to design new warheads with  more long-term reliability, allowing the United States to continue to reduce its aging  nuclear stockpile. The weapons could only have the same explosive power and be  suited for similar targets as existing ones. That's what Gates meant when he  said the Bush policy was not to add new nuclear capabilities. <br /><br />Congress denied  funding for the program in 2008. Some were concerned it sent the wrong message  to other countries that the United States was trying to persuade not to pursue nuclear  arms; and others feared it might open the door to new nuclear weapons testing.  Congress then passed the Stockpile Management Plan, which seeks to extend the  life of the nuclear arsenal without building wholly new warheads.<br /><br />Gates makes a valid  point that the Bush policy in the later years of his presidency -- while it  called for the development of new nuclear warheads -- did not call for new  nuclear <em>capabilities</em>. That's where Bush's policy ended up. But early on, the  Bush administration did call for modifications to existing weapons to create a  nuclear \"bunker buster\" that very much would have added to the United States'  nuclear capabilities. And so we rule Gates' claim Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-11T16:29:15.231527", "ruling_date": "2010-04-11T17:59:45", "ruling_headline": "Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the Bush administration policy was also not to add new nuclear capabilities", "ruling_headline_slug": "defense-secretary-robert-gates-says-bush-administr", "ruling_link_text": "But Bush sought 'Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/nuclear-disarmament-10344621?tab=9482930&amp;section=1206874&amp;playlist=6505465\" target=\"_blank\">Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates discuss the New START treaty</a>, April 11, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Department of Defense, <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/npr/docs/2010%20Nuclear%20Posture%20Review%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Nuclear Posture Review Report</a>, April 2010</p>\r\n<p>GlobalSecurity.org, <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/dod/npr.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Exceprts of Nuclear Posture Review submitted by George W.
