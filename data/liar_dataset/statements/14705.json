Kearns, a Democrat who&rsquo;s running on the Republican line for Erie County clerk, says he has a history of standing up to leadership in government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns claims&nbsp;in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZbqS7ZEQ0\">television ad</a> that he wasn&rsquo;t shy about calling out Sheldon Silver, who served as State Assembly speaker for two decades before his conviction on federal corruption charges in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign,&quot; Kearns says in the ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of his colleagues in the Assembly found it difficult to oppose Silver, even after his arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns says he didn&rsquo;t fall into that camp. Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sexual harassment in the State Assembly</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns first called for Silver to resign in 2013. It was Kearns&rsquo; first full year in the Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns chose to conference with the Democratic majority in the Assembly when he first took office in 2012. That lasted about a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then news broke that Silver had helped cover up reports of sexual harassment in the State Assembly. A state ethics report accused former Assemblyman Vito Lopez of harassing at least eight women during his time in the chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report accused Silver and his staff of failing to properly investigate the sexual harassment claims against Lopez. Silver also approved a confidential settlement of more than $100,000 for two women who accused Lopez of harassment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the ethics report was released, Kearns called for Silver to resign. He also left the Democratic conference in the Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am a father with a teenage daughter,&quot; Kearns <a href=\"http://buffalonews.com/2013/05/24/kearns-silvers-cover-ups-make-him-unfit-to-serve-as-speaker/\">wrote</a> in The Buffalo News. &quot;I must ask, &lsquo;Would I trust my daughter&rsquo;s welfare under Sheldon Silver&rsquo;s leadership or supervision?&rsquo; The record is clear beyond a reasonable doubt: The answer is &lsquo;no.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Silver&rsquo;s corruption charges</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns again called for Silver to resign in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silver was arrested on federal corruption charges in January 2015. Federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/nyregion/speaker-of-new-york-assembly-sheldon-silver-is-arrested-in-corruption-case.html?mtrref=www.google.com\">accused Silver</a> of using his position as speaker to accept millions of dollars worth of bribes and kickbacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns, who never re-joined the Democratic conference, called for Silver&rsquo;s resignation the morning he was arrested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Secret settlements, sex scandals and now criminal allegations. All of the above should disqualify Silver from keeping leadership position,&quot; Kearns said in a tweet minutes after Silver&rsquo;s arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, most Democratic Assembly members rallied behind Silver, their leader of two decades. Silver eventually stepped down after calls for his ouster mounted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns did not re-join the Democratic conference until Silver was convicted later that year. His conviction has since been overturned, but prosecutors are expected to bring a new case against the long-time assemblymember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns said when he &quot;saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kearns first called on Silver to resign in 2013. He even left the Democratic conference because he did not support Silver as speaker. His position never changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim as True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-02T16:51:10.785389", "ruling_date": "2017-11-03T17:06:15", "ruling_headline": "Kearns a constant critic to Sheldon Silver while in Assembly", "ruling_headline_slug": "kearns-constant-critic-sheldon-silver-while-assemb", "ruling_link_text": "Never liked Silver", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZbqS7ZEQ0\">Kerns for Clerk Ad</a>, Oct. 23, 2017, Mickey Kearns for Clerk YouTube page</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/nyregion/vito-lopez-accused-of-harassment-will-not-face-charges.html\">Report Finds Lawmaker Was Shielded by Leaders</a>&quot;, New York Times, May 15, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://news.wbfo.org/post/kearns-leaves-democratic-caucus-calls-silver-resign-speakership\">Kearns leaves Democratic caucus, calls on Silver to resign speakership</a>&quot;, WBFO, May 21, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/nyregion/silver-longtime-assembly-speaker-faces-new-call-to-quit.html\">Bad Week Is Merely Bump for Assembly&rsquo;s Master of Power</a>&quot;, New York Times, May 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://buffalonews.com/2013/05/24/kearns-silvers-cover-ups-make-him-unfit-to-serve-as-speaker/\">Kearns: Silver&rsquo;s cover-ups make him unfit to serve as speaker</a>&quot;, The Buffalo News, May 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-state-articles/kearns-feels-validated-by-silver-conviction.html#.WfI8dluPKpp\">Validated Kearns will rejoin Democrats after silver conviction</a>&quot;, City&amp;State, Dec. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sheldon-silver-article-1.1349739\">New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver says &#39;I&#39;m sorry&#39;
