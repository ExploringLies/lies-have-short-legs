But how large?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayor Jim Kenney pegged it as the vast majority yesterday. <a href=\"https://billypenn.com/2017/03/27/philly-is-all-in-on-immigrant-business-week-heres-why/\">It&rsquo;s Immigrant Business Week in Philly,</a> and while commemorating the week&rsquo;s launch, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhillyMayor/status/846441353341026306\">Kenney tweeted: </a>&quot;Kicking off Philly&#39;s first Immigrant Business Week! Immigrants are responsible for 96 percent of our small biz growth since 2000.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PHLimmigrantbiz?src=hash\"> #PHLimmigrantbiz</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This figure was sourced from a city fact-sheet on immigration and sanctuary cities. But here&rsquo;s the thing: Both the tweet, and the fact-sheet from which it was drawn, are incorrect. After inquiries from <em>PolitiFact Pennsylvania,</em> a city spokeswoman called it &quot;mistake that we&#39;ll be correcting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact-sheet cited a 2015 Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce report, which itself was referencing <a href=\"http://www.as-coa.org/sites/default/files/ImmigrantBusinessReport.pdf\">analysis produced by the Fiscal Policy Institute:</a> immigrant business owners accounted for 96 percent of Main Street business growth in the city from 2000 to 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that same time span, immigrant entrepreneurs represented 18 percent of Philadelphia&rsquo;s small business growth overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are Main Street establishments, exactly?<a href=\"http://www.as-coa.org/sites/default/files/ImmigrantBusinessReport.pdf\"> The research</a>, which was co-produced by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, uses it as an umbrella term for the following categories of businesses: &quot;neighborhood services,&quot; like salons and laundromats; &quot;accommodation and food services,&quot; like taverns, restaurants, but also inns; &quot;retail&quot; including a wide range of shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2017/02/15/unauthorized-immigrants-in-philadelphia\">According to Pew,</a> immigrants make up 13 percent of the city population. With an 18 percent share of small business growth, foreign-born entrepreneurs are more prone to open new businesses than their counterparts, and overwhelmingly so when it comes to opening Main Street businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is not something unique to Philadelphia. It&rsquo;s something we see nationally,&quot; explained Kate Brick, who edited the Fiscal Policy Institute and Americas Society/Council of the Americas report. Main Street establishments may be more attractive to this demographic, she added, because they pose a &quot;lower barrier of entry to starting a new business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report, which described these mom-and-pops as &quot;less capital intensive&quot; and &quot;small-scale&quot; also noted: &quot;Immigrants often get a foothold in this country by opening small businesses in run-down areas, which also have immigrant residents. A Dominican, Kurdish, or African immigrant may have a better sense of what their compatriots in the area would like to buy in a grocery or clothing store, or what would entice them to a restaurant.&quot; &nbsp;In 2013, 28 percent of Main Street businesses were immigrant-owned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <em>Billy Penn</em> has reported, while millennials get much of the attention, immigrants are <a href=\"https://billypenn.com/2016/03/24/census-breakdown-how-immigrants-are-saving-philadelphias-population/\">fueling Philadelphia&rsquo;s population boom.</a> That&rsquo;s one reason why local immigrant business growth has been so impressive. Another, the report noted, are the city&rsquo;s support through programs out of the Mayor&rsquo;s Office and Office of Immigrant Affairs, as well as partnerships with organizations like the Welcoming Center. Further, foreign-born residents have played a heavy hand in rejuvenating commercial corridors like the Italian Market, which has become popular for Latino and Southeast Asian business owners in recent decades, and North Fifth Street. That&nbsp;corridor was once dominated by shop owners of German ancestry more than a half century ago, but it&#39;s now the cultural nerve center of the Barrio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After <em>PolitiFact PA</em> contacted representatives for the mayor, Kenney retweeted his earlier message with a new note that the figure was referring to Main Streets specifically.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Since 2000, immigrants were responsible for 96% of Philly&rsquo;s Main Street small biz growth.
