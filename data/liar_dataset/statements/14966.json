They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013 for immigration reform. And each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1801/23/cnr.18.html\">said</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNNNewsroomLA/status/955898432652115968\">Brownstein</a>, who&rsquo;s also senior editor at <em>The Atlantic</em>. &quot;Without the president&#39;s leverage, without him leaning on House Republicans, you could easily see the same thing again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dreamers are in limbo after the Trump administration rescinded a program that prevented their deportation. President Donald Trump has tweeted that &quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/955795912374267907\">nobody knows for sure</a>&quot; if a deal will be reached and that it must include funding for his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/956015565776277510\">border wall</a> with Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Brownstein right about the 2006 and 2013 immigration push? He&rsquo;s got his history right, and we thought it was worth reviewing in depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">May 2006: Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, 62-36</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/2611\">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006</a> passed in the Senate on May 25, 2006, along a 62-36 vote. The bill included provisions to strengthen border security with fencing, vehicle barriers, surveillance technology and more personnel; a new temporary worker visa category; and a path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally if they met specific criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then-President George W. Bush <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/25/immigration/index.html\">commended</a> the Senate &quot;for passing bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform&quot; and said he looked forward to working with both chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the bill was never taken up by the House. The House in December 2005 passed a separate bill with greater focus on border security and enforcement, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/4437/actions\">Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005</a>. That proposal narrowed in on employment eligibility verification; immigration fraud; and immigration enforcement authority at state and local levels. It did not include a guest worker program or the legalization of immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of voting on the Senate bill, House Republican leaders held a series of summer &quot;field hearings&quot; to get the public to weigh in on controversial provisions in the Senate bill, which Republicans labeled as amnesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;&#39;Our No. 1 priority is to secure the border,&#39;&#39; then-House Speaker&nbsp;Dennis Hastert, of Illinois, <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEED71E31F932A15755C0A9609C8B63\">said in June 2006</a>. &quot;And right now I haven&#39;t heard a lot of pressure to have a path to citizenship.&#39;&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2006, after meeting with Republican leaders, Hastert <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?194186-1/immigration-issues\">said</a> they agreed &quot;that we cannot support totally&quot; a lot of the provisions in the Senate bill, because it &quot;would not secure the border. Matter of fact, it erased the border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawmakers from both chambers never formed a conference committee to iron out the details in both bills and the proposals <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42980.pdf\">expired at the end of the 109th Congress</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">June 2013: Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, 68-32</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Backed by Democrats and 14 Republicans, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act passed the Senate on a <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00168\">68-32 vote</a> on June 27, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also included provisions to allow immigrants in the country illegally to adjust their immigration status, if they met certain criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bipartisan bill that passed today was a compromise &hellip; Today, the Senate did its job. It&rsquo;s now up to the House to do the same,&quot; <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/27/statement-president-obama-senate-passage-immigration-reform-0\">said</a> then-President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But House Republicans again opposed the Senate immigration proposal, arguing that border security needed to be addressed first before legalizing the status of millions of immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve made it clear and I&rsquo;ll make it clear again, the House does not intend to take up the Senate bill,&quot; then-House Speaker John Boehner <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/john-boehner-house-immigration-vote-093845\">said July 2013</a>. &quot;The House is going to do its own job in developing an immigration bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He reiterated his position in November 2013: &quot;The idea that we&rsquo;re going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/us/politics/boehner-rules-out-push-on-immigration.html\">Boehner said</a>. &quot;And frankly, I&rsquo;ll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Brownstein said, &quot;They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013&quot; for immigration legislation,&nbsp;and &quot;each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senators did pass immigration bills in 2006 and 2013 with 62 and 68 votes, respectively.
