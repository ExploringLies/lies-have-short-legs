Pat McCrory talks about raising our pay, but he tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years,&quot; she says. &quot;Like over 2,000 other teachers, I&rsquo;m having to move to another state so I can do what I love and make ends meet. Someone needs to fix this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if McCrory really did suggest cutting education funding to the lowest share of the overall state budget in more than 30 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, though, we have to figure out what the ad was talking about. The state&rsquo;s education budget is broken into three categories &ndash; higher education, community colleges and K-12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the ad is entirely about K-12 schools and the claim is spoken by that K-12 teacher, our first impression was that the claim was about K-12 funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper&rsquo;s campaign told us it was actually referring to the total education budget. However, we believe a normal person viewing this ad will think it&rsquo;s talking about K-12 funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we&rsquo;ll look at both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Overall education spending</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s budget is tweaked annually, although the big-picture budget is set every other year, during odd-numbered years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his 2015 proposal, McCrory suggested spending 56 percent of the budget on public schools, community colleges and universities in 2015-16, and 54.4 percent in 2016-17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was that drop to 54.4 percent that Cooper&rsquo;s campaign honed in on. They cited data from McCrory&rsquo;s own budget that went back to 1981-82 and showed larger portions in all of those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said the historically low proposal was because of</p>\r\n\r\n<p>uncertainty surrounding tax cuts. He added that the funding &quot;was always expected to be increased when the legislature came back ... after the state&#39;s revenue picture became more clear as the governor&#39;s tax cuts took hold, improving the economy and in turn, increasing revenue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note here that the N.C. General Assembly did not take McCrory&rsquo;s advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015 it allocated 55.5 percent of state funding to education for 2016-17, more than a percentage point above McCrory&rsquo;s proposal. And in July 2016, lawmakers increased the 2016-17 share to 56.8 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that 56.8 percent share is, furthermore, less than what McCrory suggested in 2016. His proposal that year would have given education 57.5 percent of the state budget. That would&rsquo;ve been the highest share since 2009-10, not the lowest in 30 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither of McCrory&rsquo;s suggestions were adopted by the legislature, high or low. But the ad specifically said McCrory &quot;tried to cut&quot; education&rsquo;s budget share, so it&rsquo;s fair to look at what McCrory proposed instead of what actually passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And on that evidence, the claim is accurate about McCrory&rsquo;s 2015 proposal. His 2016 proposal, however, suggested the largest budget share for education since the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>K-12 only</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next we&rsquo;ll look only at the portion of the budget spent on K-12 schools. In 1981-82, the state spent 44 percent of its money on K-12. In 2015, McCrory suggested a 2016-17 spending level of 37.8 percent of the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a drop, but it was not the &quot;lowest budget share in over 30 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008-09, 2010-11 and 2012-13, the budget&rsquo;s share of K-12 funding was even lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2008-09 budget was under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley. The other were under Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue. The first two were passed by a Democrat-led legislature, and the 2012-13 budget was passed by a Republican-led legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Per-pupil funding</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCrory&rsquo;s campaign pointed out that the budget shares for overall education spending and for K-12 specifically also fell while Cooper was in the General Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper served in the House of Representatives from 1987-91 and in the Senate from 1991 until 2001, when he became attorney general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1987 to 2001 the share of the budget going to all types of education dropped from 68 to 60.1 percent. The K-12 share dropped from 45.5 to 42.4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the same thing Cooper&rsquo;s accusing McCrory of also happened when Cooper and his fellow Democrats were in charge of the budget. Cooper&rsquo;s campaign defended his record, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Megan Jacobs, his campaign spokeswoman, said education&rsquo;s 60.1 percent budget share in Cooper&rsquo;s final year in the Senate was &quot;almost 6 percent higher than what McCrory proposed here. It was also the highest it had been since 1993-94, which was before (Cooper) rose to senior leadership.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So both Cooper and McCrory oversaw budgets that gave a smaller slice of the pie to education. But both also oversaw increases to per-pupil funding &ndash; a metric experts agree is a more indicative measure of support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper knows all about the importance of per-pupil spending; we previously ruled his claim that North Carolina is near the bottom nationally as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/21/roy-cooper/cooper-says-north-carolinas-education-spending-stu/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And per-pupil funding &ndash; from a combination of state, local and federal sources &ndash; rose under Cooper and has also risen under McCrory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s rewind 20 years to the 1995-96 school year when Cooper was midway through his legislative career. North Carolina schools got $5,090 per student, the equivalent of $7,916 in 2015 dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper&rsquo;s last budget was for 2000-01, when he was the Democratic majority leader in the Senate. Schools that year received $6,654 per pupil, the equivalent of $9,158 in 2015 dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For comparison, North Carolina spent $8,496 per student in 2013-14 &ndash; McCrory&rsquo;s first budget, and a few dollars higher than the year prior &ndash; and an estimated $8,898 in 2015-16, according to the National Education Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper said McCrory &quot;tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCrory&rsquo;s proposed budget in 2015 did suggest doing exactly that for the 2016-17 school year, although McCrory later adjusted his proposal in 2016, when his budget&rsquo;s share of education funding would&rsquo;ve been the highest since 2009-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a detail the ad leaves out, along with the fact that the share of the budget going to education also declined when Cooper was in the legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, we rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/59591c46-5118-4647-82a3-682071f7ea26\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/59591c46-5118-4647-82a3-682071f7ea26</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-01T14:52:15.324450", "ruling_date": "2016-09-01T14:51:27", "ruling_headline": "Roy Cooper ad attacking Pat McCrory on education leaves out important details", "ruling_headline_slug": "roy-cooper-ad-attacking-pat-mccrory-education-leav", "ruling_link_text": "McCrory tried to raise spending, too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Roy Cooper education ad, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ7Y4ygTyUQ\">&quot;Fix This&quot;</a> via YouTube, Aug. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email interviews with Megan Jacobs, Roy Cooper spokeswoman</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email interviews with Ricky Diaz, Pat McCrory spokesman</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCrory&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://ncosbm.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/documents/files/BudgetBook_2015.pdf \">recommended budget for 2015-17</a>, published March 2015.
