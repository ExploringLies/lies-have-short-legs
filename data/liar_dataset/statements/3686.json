In Michigan, a new law allows the governor to take over local governments deemed to be in financial trouble.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBenton Harbor is one of several Michigan municipalities that failed a financial &quot;stress test&quot; and is now under the control of a state-appointed manager who, among other things, has the power to scrap contracts with public employee unions. Local elected officials are no longer in control.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProtests are mounting over what critics have called a &quot;dictatorship&quot; and at least once lawsuit claims the measure gives the state &quot;czar-like&quot; powers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCould financial &quot;martial law&quot; declarations be coming to Wisconsin?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to long-time Democratic activist Ed Garvey, such steps are next on the agenda of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. He first raised the issue April 14, 2011 on his &nbsp;<a href=\"http://fightingbob.com/\">Fightingbob.com</a> blog, then repeated it in subsequent postings, on Wisconsin Public Radio and in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRick Ungar, a blogger on Forbes.com, picked up Garvey&rsquo;s assertions April 16 with a posting entitled &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.forbes.com/rickungar/2011/04/16/gov-scott-walker-reportedly-planning-financial-martial-law-in-wisconsin/\">Gov. Scott Walker Reportedly Planning Financial Martial Law in Wisconsin</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo days later, during an April 18 radio interview, Walker vehemently denied being involved with any such plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo has Garvey exposed Team Walker&rsquo;s next controversial political push?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, we can&rsquo;t rule on prospective claims -- what will happen in the future. But we can look at what Garvey says he has already done -- expose plans that are under way -- and whether his evidence supports his own claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s go to Garvey&rsquo;s original blog post.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have discovered that Wisconsin&#39;s governor has the same twisted idea for Wisconsin as Michigan&#39;s governor does of his state,&quot; Garvey <a href=\"http://fightingbob.com/weblog.cfm?mode=archive&amp;theyear=2011&amp;themonth=4\">wrote</a> April 14, 2011 on his blog. &quot;The state would be allowed to take over local governments if financial management standards are not met. Who decides? The governor or a newly elected uber comptroller. (I am not making this up.)&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe adds: &quot;The secret plan is being prepared by the state&#39;s largest law firm, Foley &amp; Lardner, for the Greater Milwaukee Committee, the Bradley Foundation, the governor, and key legislators.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA closer look at the evidence shows it&rsquo;s not as Machiavellian as Garvey claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGarvey discovered a recently launched website, <a href=\"http://makeityourmilwaukee.com/the-initiative/create-a-legislative-toolkit-for-true-long-term-change/\">Makeityourmilwaukeecounty.com</a> That spells out a legislative initiative. However, it&rsquo;s hardly a secret.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe site is the online version of a project launched by a Greater Milwaukee Committee task force. It&rsquo;s an outgrowth of a years-long effort by the private business group to study and recommend reforms to Milwaukee County government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe task force&rsquo;s recommendations drew attention in an Oct. 9, 2010 <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/104647809.html\">column</a> by the Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s Dan Bice, who wrote the recommendations were back-burnered so as not to come out before the November election for governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn November, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at a claim by the state Democratic Party that GMC chairman and Walker campaign chairman Michael Grebe killed release of the report before the election. We said the claim was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/14/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/state-democratic-party-says-scott-walkers-campaign/\">Barely True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn February, the GMC task force made its <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/116162324.html\">recommendations</a> public and the website launched about the same time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report calls for several initiatives, including: &quot;Develop a statewide fiscal stress test through the State Department of Revenue to help local governments maintain fiscal health.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the site does talk about a &quot;stress test,&quot; but that&rsquo;s not the same as the &quot;martial law&quot; style approach in Michigan. In fact, the website explicitly says the group is opposed to that approach: &quot;The Initiative does not support this type of legislation in Wisconsin.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, according to GMC president Julia Taylor, about half the states have a &quot;fiscal scorecard.&quot; &nbsp;The thinking, she said, is that the more the public knows about how their local government is faring, the sooner problems can be headed off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTaylor said she wasn&rsquo;t sure when a bill including the GMC&rsquo;s plan would be introduced or by whom.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s very, very early in the process,&quot; she said. &quot;At this point we don&rsquo;t have draft language.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, some heavy-hitters are working with the GMC to build support for the recommendations and hammer them into legislation -- including lobbyists with Foley &amp; Lardner, former state legislator Mary Panzer and public relations firm Mueller Communications. And the GMC is chaired by Grebe, who was Walker&rsquo;s campaign chairman and led the governor&rsquo;s transition team. Grebe also heads the conservative Bradley Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it may be easy to see why Garvey tries to connect some of the dots.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about the essence of Garvey&rsquo;s claim, that he discovered Walker&rsquo;s involvement with the plan being discussed -- and, therefore, his support of it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Milwaukee County executive, Walker expressed support for the GMC efforts. But in the wake of Garvey&rsquo;s first blog post, he issued a sharp denial about involvement now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No truth to it whatsoever. &nbsp;Absolutely a bogus story,&quot; Walker <a href=\"http://www.620wtmj.com/news/local/120058874.html\">said</a> April 18, 2011 in an interview with WTMJ-AM (620) &nbsp;talk show host Charlie Sykes. &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s nobody on my staff, nobody in my administration, I&#39;m certainly not working anything remotely close to that.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNevertheless, Garvey said in an interview that he still believes that Walker is involved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think that&rsquo;s true,&quot; he said. &quot;It all sort of fits in with a pattern.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut thinking something is true and showing it to be true are two different things.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGarvey says he discovered a secret plot by Walker to push Michigan-style legislation that would allow the state to test the finances of local governments and then take over the bad apples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Greater Milwaukee Committee is proposing a &quot;good-government&quot; style website that would allow citizens to compare and contrast the health of local government finances. But it explicitly stops short of a Michigan-style approach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, Garvey did not uncover it (it was previously announced by the group) and he&rsquo;s provided no direct evidence of involvement from Walker, who vehemently denies it. The measure could change through the legislative process, but that&rsquo;s the future.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGarvey had a &quot;scoop.&quot; But it was more of the gardening -- and not journalistic -- variety. We rate his claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-03T17:41:09.722821", "ruling_date": "2011-05-05T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrat and activist Ed Garvey says Wisconsin Gov.
