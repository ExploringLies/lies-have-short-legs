A Branch radio ad, posted Jan. 29, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC3CQxMOAbo&amp;list=TL0rKnowFe5p2bufo3iawV6mB2XC-IgyOz\"><u>similarly said</u></a> that Branch &quot;worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas warhorses of the Reagan era -- George Strake, who then chaired the Republican Party of Texas; Ernest Angelo of Midland, a leading Reagan supporter; and Tom Pauken, then in the Reagan administration -- each told us by telephone that he didn&rsquo;t recall Branch working with Reagan. Pauken, saying Branch had long been more closely associated with the Bush wing of the party, called Branch&rsquo;s statement &quot;misleading.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Branch&rsquo;s campaign manager, Enrique Marquez, for the basis of the ad claim. He said by email that Branch was hired in 1984 to &quot;administer the Victory Fund of the Reagan/Bush &#39;84 re-election effort in Texas, reporting directly to Reagan/Bush Texas co-chairs, U.S. Sen. John Tower and Martha Weisend,&quot; who are both no longer living. &quot;The Victory Fund,&quot; Marquez said, &quot;was a joint effort of the Reagan/Bush &#39;84 campaign in Texas and the state Republican party.&quot; Marquez added that in his role, Branch met Reagan at Texas campaign stops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked for more detail, Marquez emailed that Branch succeeded Bob Estrada as the fund&rsquo;s administrator. Estrada, a Dallas lawyer and investment banker, told us by phone that Branch was already the deputy administrator when he was promoted to take Estrada&rsquo;s place as the committee&rsquo;s administrator in May or June of 1984 after Estrada agreed to work for the Reagan-Bush campaign in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estrada said the purpose of the Victory Fund was to register and turn out voters for the president and other Republicans, including Phil Gramm, the party&rsquo;s nominee for the Senate seat being given up by Tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estrada had no objection to Branch saying he &quot;worked with&quot; Reagan. &quot;Millions of people worked with Reagan. Do you have to be a Cabinet member to say you were directly involved?&quot; Estrada said. &quot;People who stood in the mall and handed out brochures worked with&quot; Reagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also reached Karl Rove, the long-time adviser to George W. Bush, who said by phone that he remembered Branch as the <em>de facto</em> chief operating officer of the Victory Fund, which Rove described as a volunteer-intensive effort to lift Reagan-Bush and others. At the time, Rove said, he handled some direct-mail work for the committee and also offered advice. Rove said Branch, who was 26 at the time of Reagan&rsquo;s re-election, &quot;had a significant role for someone his age.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branch said he &quot;worked with Ronald Reagan and helped re-elect him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This partly holds up in that Branch was an underling for a Texas committee devoted to helping Reagan win re-election and to electing other Republicans. Then again, his claim leaves the impression that Branch was right alongside Reagan, perhaps as a White House aide or joining in the president&#39;s day-to-day travels.
