But we certainly can check his factual statement about Obama's poll numbers, a claim we've seen repeated in other media.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Gallup poll actually has been tracking presidential approval ratings since World War II. We consulted Gallup's tracking polls and found that Gingrich is correct. At the seven-month mark, Obama's approval rating was 51 percent. The only two presidents doing worse than Obama were Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton.\n</p>\n<p>\n Interestingly, Ford and Clinton finished their presidencies with decidely different outcomes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ford's public approval ratings dropped below 50 percent about three months into his presidency. Those numbers improved slightly and plateaued over the next few years. But Ford, who took office upon Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Clinton's approval ratings dropped below 50 percent four months into his presidency, falling even further during his first year in office to the high 30s. There were a few more ups and downs during his first term, but he won re-election in 1996 and finished his term in 2001 with approval ratings above 60 percent, despite being impeached by the House of Representatives after a sex scandal.\n</p>\n<p>\n Make of all this what you will. We've looked into Gingrich's statement and found that he is correct. We rate his statement True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:44.644482", "ruling_date": "2009-08-31T14:25:18", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama poll after seven months shows him behind other presidents", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-poll-after-seven-months-shows-him-beh", "ruling_link_text": "Seven months in, Obama lags", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n Washington Post,\n <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/28/AR2009082803158.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  How can President Obama regain his political footing\n </a>\n , Aug. 30, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n This Week with George Stephanopoulos,\n <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=8443218\" target=\"_blank\">\n  transcript\n </a>\n , Aug. 30, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Gallup poll,\n <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/Presidential-Approval-Ratings-Gallup-Historical-Statistics-Trends.aspx#2\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Presidential Approval Ratings -- Gallup Historical Statistics and Trends\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Gallup poll,\n <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/122513/Presidential-Approval-Usually-Falls-Below-Timing-Varies.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Presidential Approval Usually Falls Below 50%; Timing Varies\n </a>\n , Aug. 26, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n USA Today,\n <span class=\"inside-head\">\n  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/presidential-approval-tracker.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Polls can affect president's hold on party\n  </a>\n  , July 20, 2009\n  <br />\n </span>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Newt", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 152, "last_name": "Gingrich", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "newt-gingrich", "pants_count": 12, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gingrichcutter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/152/", "total_count": 86, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an op-ed in The Washington Post", "statement_date": "2009-08-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": null}
