House Democrats had staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to try to force a vote on gun-control legislation. The House, in response, went into recess and the cameras in the House chamber were shut off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may not sound like the makings of a viral late-night joke, but stay tuned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Undaunted, Democrats started transmitting video and images of the sit-in via social media tools such as Periscope, a live video streaming app. The sit-in, which House Speaker Paul Ryan subsequently blasted as a publicity stunt, lasted 26 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> carried a 25-second <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yktsv0_q42Q&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>comedy bit</u></a> about the event, which began with a pan up the facade of the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the show is taped, followed by a quick cut to Colbert, holding a dog and sitting on a couch with supervising producer and writer Paul Dinello. Both were watching the feed from the House floor on a wall-mounted TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why am I watching Congress on Periscope?&quot; Colbert asks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s because Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in,&quot; Dinello responds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Colbert responds. &quot;Wow, what a petty son of a &mdash;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly the picture cuts to a cartoon of Ryan holding two ends of an unplugged power cord and the sign, &quot;Sorry!

Shameful.&quot; The Daily Show <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rQEdnozYZL8\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said so</u></a> as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real answer is no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress&#39; rules for operating the cameras &mdash; which Congress controls &mdash; call for video transmission to end as soon as the gavel goes down for recess or adjournment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happened when the protest started</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/timeline-house-democratic-sit-guns\"><em>Roll Call</em> provided</a> a good timeline of the protest and the reaction of Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House was in session and cameras were rolling the morning of June 22. Lawmakers were in something called&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Morning Hour,&quot; which basically allows members to speak to any issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At about 11:25 a.m., Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., took to the House floor with a group of Democrats&nbsp;and demanded lawmakers vote on gun legislation. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., spoke next with a similar message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point, Larson yielded the floor to Lewis, who said, &quot;Now is the time to find a way to dramatize it, to make it real.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lewis and a number of Democrats then sat down in the House well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Ryan wasn&#39;t at the speaker&#39;s rostrum. The presiding officer was&nbsp;Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla. Webster, after conferring with House staff, declared a recess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Webster declared the recess, the cameras in the House went dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a half-hour later, around noon, Republicans tried to gavel the House back into session and the cameras came back on. Again, Ryan was not the presiding officer. This time&nbsp;it was Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. Democrats remained in the well of the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poe declared that the House &quot;is currently not in a state of order&quot; and called another recess. The cameras went black again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast-forward to shortly after&nbsp;10 p.m. The House came back into session and the cameras turned on again. This time,&nbsp;Ryan asked Democrats to end the protest. They didn&#39;t, and the protest continued as Republicans struggled off and on to conduct some House business into the early morning hours. At&nbsp;3:13 a.m., they adjourned until Friday, and the cameras were turned off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The key point</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main takeaway in all of this is what triggered the camera going on and off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The camera was off because the House was not in session, not because of an&nbsp;order from Ryan. That&#39;s been a House standard going back years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&#39;t the first time this has happened. During a sit-in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2008/08/house-dems-turn-out-the-lights-but-gop-keeps-talking-010724\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\"><u>eight years ago</u></a>, cameras were cut for the Republicans when Democrats controlled the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minority Leader John Boehner wanted a vote on offshore oil drilling, a motion to adjourn was passed, and the C-SPAN cameras were turned off. The Republicans kept talking anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that case, the lights and the microphones were turned off for a while as well. Yet the Republicans kept talking. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2008/08/house-dems-turn-out-the-lights-but-gop-keeps-talking-010724\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>As Politico reported</u></a>, &quot;Democratic aides were furious at the GOP stunt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That protest <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/cspan-house-sitin-democrats-224696\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>lasted five hours</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But back then, social media and video streaming services weren&rsquo;t in the palms of every lawmaker&rsquo;s hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Democrats staged the latest protest, several members were broadcasting on Facebook and Periscope. C-SPAN picked up both feeds and continued to show the events, using the same style and logos they use when they&#39;re tapping into the House cameras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We note that, in the sketch, Colbert isn&#39;t the person saying, &quot;Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in.&quot; But just as we make candidates responsible for all the statements in their ads, we have no doubt Colbert approved this message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A CBS spokeswoman, who identified Dinello for us, declined comment on the content of the sketch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert </em>asserted that Ryan &quot;shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan didn&#39;t order the cameras shut off in response to the protest. They were turned off because House Republicans declared the House session in recess. That&#39;s a standard policy of Congress, even if it was Republicans making the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colbert&#39;s bit was funny, but on its factual basis we rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92344eb8-90bb-4f8f-8538-82fe220e5176\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92344eb8-90bb-4f8f-8538-82fe220e5176</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-27T10:44:10.352152", "ruling_date": "2016-06-27T18:00:31", "ruling_headline": "Stephen Colbert wrong that Paul Ryan killed the House cameras in response to the Democratic sit-in", "ruling_headline_slug": "stephen-colbert-wrong-paul-ryan-killed-house-camer", "ruling_link_text": "Gavel goes down, cameras go off", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Yktsv0_q42Q\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Why Am I Watching Congress on Periscope?</u></a>&quot;
