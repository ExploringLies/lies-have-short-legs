Western observers have characterized the enigmatic group -- also called Al-Ikhw\u0101n -- as everything from democratic reformers to Islamic Socialists bent on global dominion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his Fox News Channel program for Feb. 4, 2011, Glenn Beck wrapped up five days of frightening Egypt forecasts with this blunt assessment:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We told you this week how if (President Hosni) Mubarak does step down, however, the Muslim Brotherhood would be the most likely group to seize power. They&#39;ve openly stated they want to declare war on Israel and they would end the peace agreement with Israel and they would work towards instituting something we told you about, a caliphate.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat&rsquo;s a lot to unpack. We decided to check Beck&rsquo;s claim that the Brotherhood has &quot;openly stated they want to declare war on Israel,&quot; because so much of the debate in the United States revolves around the Muslim Brotherhood&#39;s intentions toward the main U.S. ally in the region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeck neglected to name a source in that Feb. 4 broadcast, so we took a look through the rest of his transcripts for the week. Sure enough, three days earlier he informed viewers that &quot;a top official in the Muslim Brotherhood has just said that &hellip; &lsquo;The people should be prepared for war against Israel.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho was that top official? Beck&rsquo;s website pointed to a Feb. 1, 2011, item in the <em>Jerusalem Post</em> that had a &quot;leading member&quot; of the Brotherhood, Muhammad Ghannem, declaring that &quot;the people should be prepared for war against Israel.&quot; The next day a <em>Washington Times</em> editorial picked up the quote, saying it &quot;succinctly summed up&quot; the Muslim Brotherhood&#39;s foreign policy. Then Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., repeated the fiery words in a floor speech.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <em>Jerusalem Post</em> piece cited an interview Ghannem gave to an Arabic-language Iranian network, Al-Alam. With deft use of Google Translate we were able to verify that Ghannem was quoted saying something along those lines in a Jan. 31, 2011, piece on Al-Alam&rsquo;s website. The key question then becomes whether Ghannem can speak for the sprawling Muslim Brotherhood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I have never heard of him,&quot; said Dr. Jason Brownlee, an associate professor in the&nbsp;Department of Government&nbsp;at the University of Texas and a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. &quot;It&rsquo;s a big organization, and there may be people who say things like that, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s policy. It doesn&rsquo;t jibe with my experience visiting Egypt and doing research on the Muslim Brotherhood for over a decade.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThree other experts on the Muslim Brotherhood all agreed. &quot;The MB is a massive organization with many different ideological trends within it,&quot; explained Dr. Joshua Stacher, a political scientist at Kent State. &quot;I have never heard anyone on or off the record say they &lsquo;wish to declare war on Israel.&rsquo; &quot; None were familiar with Ghannem, who we confirmed is not among the the Brotherhood&rsquo;s policy elite, the 16-member Guidance Bureau.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, there&rsquo;s no doubt that the Brotherhood officially condemns Israel, its neighbor across the Sinai Peninsula. According to a report on the group&rsquo;s own website, a controversy erupted in 2007 when spokesman Essam El-Erian was quoted in London-based paper <em>Al-Hayat</em> saying that the Brotherhood would recognize Israel if it came to power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn response, then-Supreme Guide Mohamed Mahdy Akef clarified that &quot;the Brotherhood does not and will never recognize Israel. ... Israel does not exist in the Brotherhood&rsquo;s dictionary.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEl-Erian maintained that he had been misquoted and was only calling for a referendum on the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. That&rsquo;s still the official line since the protests in Tahrir Square began.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt a press conference in Cairo on Feb. 9, 2011, El-Erian and Mohammed Musri -- both of whom do sit on the Brotherhood&rsquo;s Guidance Bureau -- declared that the group respects the treaty and any changes would be up to a democratically elected government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrownlee pointed out that many Egyptians believe the 1979 treaty lacks legitimacy; it passed with nearly unanimous approval in what was seen as a fraudulent vote. Opinions vary as to how it would fare today, but, as George Washington University professor Nathan Brown pointed out, revoking a peace treaty is a far cry from declaring war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a Feb. 2 interview on NPR&rsquo;s <em>All Things Considered</em>, El-Erian confirmed that view. He called again for revising the terms of the treaty but, asked what that would mean, dismissed fears of armed conflict.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Oh, no threat of war,&quot; El-Erian told Robert Siegel. &quot;The people are not pushing for war. But it is not our duty to protect Israel from Palestinians. We are not guards for Israel.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo some members of the Muslim Brotherhood may be calling for war. But the ones who say that don&rsquo;t speak for the group; and the ones who do speak for the group, don&rsquo;t say that. We rate Beck&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-15T10:25:26.122583", "ruling_date": "2011-02-15T11:12:56", "ruling_headline": "Glenn Beck says Muslim Brotherhood wants to declare war on Israel", "ruling_headline_slug": "glenn-beck-says-muslim-brotherhood-wants-declare-w", "ruling_link_text": "Quoting a member; spokesmen said otherwise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-al-qaeda-links-muslim-brotherhood/\">&quot;Glenn Beck on al-Qaida links to Muslim Brotherhood,&quot;</a>by Robert Farley, Jan. 31, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcript of Glenn Beck Program, Feb. 4, 2011, accessed through Nexis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcript of Glenn Beck Program, Feb. 1, 2011, accessed through Nexis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glenn Beck Program website, <a href=\"http://www.glennbeck.com/2011/02/07/study-guide-tsa-trumka-and-muslim-brotherhood/\">&quot;Study Guide: TSA, Trumka, and Muslim Brotherhood,&quot;</a>&nbsp; Feb. 2, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Jerusalem Post, </em><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=206130\">&quot;Muslim Brotherhood: &lsquo;Prepare Egyptians for war with Israel,&#39;&quot;</a>by Yaakov Lappin, Feb. 1, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al-Alam News Channel website,<a href=\"http://www.alalam.ir/node/356111\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.alalam-news.com/node/356111\">&quot;Egyptian Politicians Accuse the Army Leadership of Coordination with Washington,&quot;</a> Jan. 31, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ikhwanweb, the Muslim Brotherhood&#39;s Official English website, <a href=\"http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=14407\">&quot;El-Erian says Al-Hayat misquoted him, confirms Brotherhood position on Israel,&quot; </a>Yasmine Saleh, Oct. 19, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Council on Foreign Relations, <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/africa/egypts-muslim-brotherhood/p23991\">&quot;Egypt&#39;s Muslim Brotherhood,&quot;</a> by Jayshree Bajoria, Feb. 3, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Foreign Affairs, </em><a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67348/carrie-rosefsky-wickham/the-muslim-brotherhood-after-mubarak?page=show\">&quot;The Muslim Brotherhood After Mubarak,&quot;</a> by Carrie Rosefsky Wickham, Feb. 3, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/2/egypts-blood-obamas-hands/\">&quot;Egypt&rsquo;s blood on Obama&rsquo;s hands?,&quot;</a> Feb. 2, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Sen.
