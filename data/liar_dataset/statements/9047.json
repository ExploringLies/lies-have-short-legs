Patrick and incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst are slated to run off for the Republican nomination on May 27, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad, sponsored by Dewhurst, included this curious claim: Patrick, the announcer said, &quot;supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Patrick, a radio talk-show host and businessman who hasn&rsquo;t served in Congress, do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us Dewhurst&rsquo;s backup <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGQzR6Q2dtODM2aFE/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>document</u></a> for the ad, which states that twice on CNN&rsquo;s &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight,&quot; Patrick suggested vouchers for Americans to buy cars instead of the federal government bailing out automobile manufacturers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Nov. 25, 2008, edition of the show, Dobbs suggested an urgency to the then-proposed bailout and sought Patrick&rsquo;s thoughts, according to CNN&rsquo;s transcript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dobbs: &quot;This auto industry bailout, we got to have it. There&#39;s just no question. Whatever the reason is, national security, you name it. Three million people lose their jobs. We have got to do something. I don&#39;t get why Congress is so uptight about this idea after basically signing on for $8 trillion. Do you, Dan?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick: &quot;Well, I do get it from this standpoint, Lou, is until we see a plan that they&#39;re going to change their business model, we&#39;re bridging the gap until they eventually go bankrupt. I&#39;m not in favor of any of these bailouts but I would rather see let&#39;s bail out the middle class that you had a story earlier in the show that&#39;s being hammered. Give each family a voucher for $5,000 that can only be used if they buy a new truck or automobile.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That will start moving inventory,&quot; Patrick then said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Texan added: &quot;We need some practical thinking on the main street level to help the average, American family. That&#39;s what we need to help get the economy rolling. Once the economy is rolling, everything takes care of itself but I&#39;m tired of giving money to Wall Street, tired of seeing Congress have no transparency where this money is going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s put it in the pockets of the people,&quot; Patrick said. &quot;We got here, Lou, because once upon a time, the saying was, we&#39;re spending our children&#39;s money and our grandchildren&#39;s money. This government is now spending our great-grandchildren&#39;s money and the factor of inflation and debt is going to destroy this country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier on the program, Patrick said: &quot;Most people don&#39;t want to see General Motors fail but they also don&#39;t want their tax dollars and bail out a company that has had bad ideas and bad management.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick also brought up the voucher idea on the March 31, 2009, edition of Dobbs&rsquo; program, we confirmed from the CNN transcript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Six months ago,&quot; Patrick said to Dobbs, &quot;I was on your show here after the first stimulus, Lou, and I suggested that the government send a $5,000 check to every head of a household who had an auto registration and it could&quot; only be &quot;used to buy a car.&quot; (Patrick wasn&rsquo;t that specific earlier, at least according to the 2008 show&rsquo;s transcript.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick continued in his 2009 appearance: &quot;If we want to use stimulus money effectively, send a check for five grand to everyone in America, head of a household, that they can only use to buy a car. That will move cars.&quot; Later in the interview, Patrick said: &quot;But instead of sending Detroit the money, send it to people&quot; to go buy a car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about the senator&rsquo;s statements to Dobbs, Patrick spokesman Logan Spence pointed us to a Patrick campaign <a href=\"http://www.danpatrick.org/facts/\"><u>web page</u></a> including a section declaring Dewhurst&rsquo;s voucher claim a lie. &quot;This is a misrepresentation of&quot; Patrick&rsquo;s &quot;position,&quot; Patrick&rsquo;s camp says. &quot;He said that the money the federal government was playing with to bail out the auto industry would be better served being returned to their rightful owner&mdash;the taxpayer&mdash;for use of buying a car should they want to.&quot; Vouchers, Spence said by email, struck Patrick as a &quot;better and cheaper idea.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst said Patrick &quot;supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick advocated such vouchers, but this claim fails to note that Patrick pitched them as a direct way of bolstering auto manufacturing instead of the federal bailout of manufacturers. It&rsquo;s worth clarifying, too, that a state senator doesn&#39;t hold much sway over what the federal government does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim as Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-14T17:04:54.929601", "ruling_date": "2014-03-14T16:10:41", "ruling_headline": "Dan Patrick suggested every family get $5,000 voucher toward buying a car instead of Uncle Sam bailing out auto manufacturers", "ruling_headline_slug": "dan-patrick-suggested-every-family-get-5000-vouche", "ruling_link_text": "Vouchers as alternative to federal bailout of auto makers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Document, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGQzR6Q2dtODM2aFE/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>&quot;AD FACT CHECK: NAME THAT FAKE CONSERVATIVE,&quot;</u></a> David Dewhurst campaign, Feb. 26, 2014 (received by email from Travis Considine, title, Dewhurst campaign, March 3, 2014)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trancripts, &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight,&quot; CNN, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0811/25/ldt.01.html\"><u>Nov. 25, 2008</u></a>, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0903/31/ldt.01.html\"><u>March 31, 2009</u></a> (accessed March 11, 2014)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UOlyOyIzl2oWUApPGe3Q8n9aywU76jRRxYA1xGWhnrM/pub\"><u>Emails</u></a>, Logan Spence, campaign manager, Dan Patrick campaign, March 3 and 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web page, <a href=\"http://www.danpatrick.org/facts/\"><u>&quot;Get the facts,&quot;</u></a> Dan Patrick campaign (accessed March 4, 2014)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Lieutenant governor", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 315, "last_name": "Dewhurst", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "david-dewhurst", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Dewhurstmug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/315/", "total_count": 41, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.daviddewhurst.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Dan Patrick &quot;supported giving a $5,000 taxpayer-funded voucher to every family to buy a car.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV ad", "statement_date": "2014-03-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 119, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/119/", "subject": "Families", "subject_slug": "families", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "Lieutenant governor-elect", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Dan", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1030, "last_name": "Patrick", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "dan-patrick", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ColorPatrick80-01-08pft.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1030/", "total_count": 32, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.danpatrick.org/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
