Scott Walker took office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After another reference to Walker&rsquo;s jobs promise, from his first campaign for governor in 2010, the video replays the audio of the anchor&rsquo;s words and then these words appear on the screen:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Job creation fell by 70% in Wisconsin in 2016.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, the number of private-sector jobs in Wisconsin has increased each year Walker has been in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Evers refers to the most recent annual figure that measures how fast jobs are growing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see if he&rsquo;s correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The promise and the race</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his first term. Our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/\">Walk-O-Meter</a>, which tracks the Republican&rsquo;s campaign promises, rated that pledge <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/526/create-250000-new-jobs/\">Promise Broken</a>.

The original source of the data was the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Walker&rsquo;s campaign organization for a response and were referred to Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Alec Zimmerman. He cited a June 2017 <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/06/16/reidl-wisconsins-remarkable-job-growth-celebrated/102914714/\">opinion article</a>&nbsp;in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel by a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, which called Wisconsin&rsquo;s job growth over six years &quot;extraordinarily strong,&quot; and told us:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For someone to talk about Wisconsin&rsquo;s job growth while leaving out the fact that the state is exceeding what most economists consider to be full employment, not only ignores a critical factors but gives a very skewed impression of Wisconsin&rsquo;s economy &hellip;.We aren&#39;t talking about job losses. This is about slower gains, and gains that are slower because we are at or near full employment, a good thing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quarterly figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal quarterly figures are considered the gold standard for job counts. Although the claim we&rsquo;re checking focuses on the change in 2016, the Evers video also alludes to Walker&rsquo;s entire tenure. So, for perspective, we&rsquo;ll show the annual figures for private-sector job growth for each year since Walker took office in January 2011 (percentages are rounded).</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Year</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Annual increase in private- sector jobs in Wisconsin</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Percentage change in private-sector job growth vs the previous year</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>33,658</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>---</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>29,800</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>-11%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>33,872</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>+14%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>29,723</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>-12%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>36,758</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>+24%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>38,077</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>+4%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>2016</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>12,937</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>-66%</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for 2011 through 2015, the number of private-sector jobs rose by roughly 30,000 to 38,000 per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in 2016, the increase was 66 percent lower than the increase in 2015 -- nearly the 70 percent figure Evers claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Evers doesn&rsquo;t directly blame Walker, his video is an attack that clearly holds Walker at least partly responsible.
