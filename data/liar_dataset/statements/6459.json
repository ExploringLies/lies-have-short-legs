The not-too-distant origins of Florida&rsquo;s finest courthouse serve as a cautionary tale about last-minute lawmaking and unscrutinized government spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it fair to say Storms voted to fund the new courthouse of the 1st District Court of Appeal?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s dive in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn her 2010 <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/article1114049.ece\">investigative story</a>&nbsp;about the facility, <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> senior correspondent Lucy Morgan characterized the courthouse as &quot;a $48 million behemoth in which each judge will get a 60-inch LCD flat screen television in chambers (trimmed in mahogany), a private bathroom (featuring granite countertops) and a kitchen (complete with microwave and refrigerator).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a year of layoffs and cutbacks across the state, these touches of elegance were not appreciated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how did the project eke past officials and watchdogs (press corps included)?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan compiled a <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/taj-mahal-timeline-how-a-50-million-courthouse-got-in-the-budget-but/1140773\">detailed timeline</a>&nbsp;stretching from a May 2004 meeting of the 1st DCA judges, in which they said they had outgrown their 23-year-old building, to December 2010, when the fresh, controversial structure was ready for move-in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA key moment in the story happened on the last day of the 2007 legislative session, a typically hectic time ripe for last-minute, undetected budget maneuvering. Tampa Sen. Victor Crist <a href=\"http://archive.flsenate.gov/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=session/2007/House/bills/amendments/html/hb0985e2804206.html\">introduced an amendment </a>to a 142-page transportation bill that contained a bond issue for $33.5 million for the courthouse&rsquo;s construction. No senators asked about the bond issue, and it passed on a voice vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill itself, <a href=\"http://archive.flsenate.gov/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=hb098505e3.html&amp;Directory=session/2007/House/bills/billtext/html/\">HB 985</a>, passed by a vote of 37-2. Storms, like most everyone, <a href=\"http://archive.flsenate.gov/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=session/2007/House/bills/votes/html/SHB09850503070061.html\">voted yes</a>. It passed the House, then led by Marco Rubio, and was signed into law by Gov. Charlie Crist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStorms, interviewed by PolitiFact Florida, said she thought she was voting to refurbish a dilapidated courthouse.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It certainly wasn&rsquo;t to build mahogany,&quot; she said. &quot;Anybody who was voting at that time was not voting for the &lsquo;Taj Mahal.&rsquo; What we were voting to do was taking care of the 1st DCA.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStorms and Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, became two of the <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/article1145064.ece\">project&rsquo;s most vocal critics</a>&nbsp;in the months following the <em>Times </em>story. At one point in a committee hearing, Storms quipped, &quot;We should insist on our pound of flesh and make them put the air at 80 in the summer and at 50 in the winter.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs an aside, Storms said she probably voted against Crist&rsquo;s amendment, which contained the bonding language, on an unrecorded voice vote out of a personal philosophy to protest unvetted, &quot;vendor-driven&quot; language affixed to bills in session&rsquo;s closing days. (There is no record of voice votes, so we can&#39;t tell how Storms voted.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFasano told us Turner&rsquo;s attack is &quot;just not honest&quot; despite Storms&#39; technical support of the transportation bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You might as well blame every legislator that voted for it,&quot; he said, which would total 105 members.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s the point, says Warren Weathers, who works for Turner. He recalled Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, saying legislators share blame with the judges who pushed for the fine finishes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We didn&rsquo;t say she built it,&quot; Weathers said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrist (of no relation to Florida&rsquo;s former governor) defended Storms in an interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Ronda approving the budget for the court system and the construction budget for a new courthouse has nothing to do with the court&rsquo;s design, engineering and building,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be like saying her approval of the DMV budget holds her accountable for somebody&rsquo;s else driving record.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrist&rsquo;s position is understandable. He says groups aligned with the tea party are using the &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; -- a moniker he hates -- against him in his re-election campaign for Hillsborough County Commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurner says in a mailer that Storms &quot;voted to fund the &lsquo;Taj Mahal&rsquo; Courthouse.&quot; She indeed cast a vote for a transportation bill that included funding for the courthouse, that much is true. But there is some additional information we find missing from this attack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNamely, the courthouse money was inserted at the last minute into a larger bill without much explanation. The money, as far as most lawmakers knew, was to build a courthouse, not an opulent one. Once details of the &lsquo;Taj&rsquo; became known, Storms openly criticized the plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-13T18:06:56.123565", "ruling_date": "2012-08-13T18:25:24", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
