Some of the companies deal with industry regulators that Thompson oversaw as Secretary of Health and Human Services during the George W. Bush administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn January 2012, &nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompsons-assets-top-13-million-153v4vd-138169534.html\">Journal Sentinel </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompsons-assets-top-13-million-153v4vd-138169534.html\">reported </a>Thompson&rsquo;s net worth has reached roughly $13 million, much of in the seven years since he left government and began a career as corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompsons-assets-top-13-million-153v4vd-138169534.html\">says </a>the &quot;corporate lobbyist&quot; label is flat out false.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Hovde, in a July 26, 2012 <a href=\"http://wtaq.com/podcasts/jerry-bader-show/eric-hovde-responds-attacks/\">interview with Jerry </a><a href=\"http://wtaq.com/podcasts/jerry-bader-show/eric-hovde-responds-attacks/\">Bader </a>on WTAQ-AM in Green Bay, pressed the claim, even saying Thompson was &quot;lobbying during the middle of the campaign.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs Hovde right? Even during the campaign?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde makes three points in support of his statement: Thompson&rsquo;s employment at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld in Washington, D.C.; a media report on Thompson contacting a North Carolina lawmaker; and a campaign-donation report that listed Thompson&rsquo;s occupation as &quot;lobbyist.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Washington</strong> <strong>firm</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde correctly calls Akin Gump a &quot;lobbying firm&quot; -- it&rsquo;s considered a Washington <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?id=D000000162&amp;year=2012\">lobbying powerhouse</a>. But it&rsquo;s also an international law firm, and Thompson, an attorney, was listed as a partner before he left in January 2012 to campaign for U.S. Senate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome Akin Gump partners are registered lobbyists while others, such as Thompson, are not registered to lobby, according to <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/LDA_reports.htm\">public </a><a href=\"http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/\">databases</a> of federal lobbyists.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson points to his unregistered status as proof he&rsquo;s not a lobbyist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut does that mean Thompson doesn&rsquo;t lobby federal officials? Not by itself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal law requires individuals to register as lobbyists if they have more than one lobbying contact in a three-month period while representing a client. The work must make up at least 20 percent of the lobbyist&rsquo;s work for a client.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson, then, could limit such contacts, put his influence to work, and still fly beneath the rules.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have at least 3,000 unregistered lobbyists, and the number is probably far higher than that,&quot; said Howard Marlowe, a lobbying firm president and head of the American League of Lobbyists, who spoke in general and not specifically about Thompson.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Hovde proves nothing by pointing to Thompson&rsquo;s employer and didn&rsquo;t point to a single lobbying incident. Thompson&rsquo;s defense, meanwhile, is a point in his favor but does not close the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Telephone call</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde referred us to a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-31/republicans-target-dental-bill-that-private-equity-hates.html\">May 2012 Bloomberg </a><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-31/republicans-target-dental-bill-that-private-equity-hates.html\">news </a>account -- confirmed by Thompson -- in which the former governor called the speaker of the North Carolina state House of Representatives about a state bill toughening regulations on controversial dental management companies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrivate-equity firms have invested heavily in such firms, and Thompson has consulted with several private-equity firms, leading to speculation he was lobbying against the bill -- and right in the midst of the Senate race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the North Carolina lawmaker, Thom Tillis, says he and Thompson never connected. Thompson told us he called not on behalf of a paying client, but a &quot;friend of a friend&quot; -- whose name he could not recall -- who wanted to know when the bill would be considered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, at best that part of the claim is murky.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Campaign report</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, there&rsquo;s the matter of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-North Dakota) listing Thompson as a &quot;lobbyist&quot; on a 2010 campaign report showing a $1,000 donation from Thompson. There is a document showing that in Federal Election Commission records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson&rsquo;s campaign says Thompson didn&rsquo;t list himself that way, suggesting that Hoeven&rsquo;s campaign erroneously wrote in that occupation. Hoeven&rsquo;s campaign did not get back to us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The big picture</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe could not find any media references that labeled Thompson a lobbyist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne Thompson affiliation that drew our attention was his role as chairman of an advisory board at Constella Group, a North Carolina medical research firm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConstella&rsquo;s CEO has said Thompson was brought on to &quot;connect&quot; the company with U.S. and foreign governments and advise it on growth strategies. Constella then agreed to hire Akin Gump -- but not Thompson specifically -- as its lobbyist, the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/president/29294579.html\">Journal Sentinel </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/president/29294579.html\">reported </a>in 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s getting closer to what a lobbyist does, but Thompson told us nothing he did for Constella constituted lobbying, and we found no evidence otherwise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Washington, the kind of work Thompson does is often described as either a &quot;strategic advice&quot; consultant or a &quot;rainmaker&quot; whose influence and connections bring work to his firm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Broydrick, a veteran lobbyist in Wisconsin and Washington, put it this way: &quot;A consultant&rsquo;s responsibility is to give his or her client their best professional advice, and that is not lobbying. That&rsquo;s telling people how they should lobby.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, Thompson <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompsons-assets-top-13-million-153v4vd-138169534.html\">has told </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompsons-assets-top-13-million-153v4vd-138169534.html\">reporters </a>that he does work with a lobbyist at Akin Gump who lobbies for health care clients. An Akin Gump spokesman told us: &quot;Gov. Thompson was a strategic adviser in Akin Gump&rsquo;s health care practice, and did not engage in any activity that required him to register as a lobbyist.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson&rsquo;s situation reminds us somewhat of the debate during the GOP presidential primary over Newt Gingrich&rsquo;s statement that he &quot;never lobbied under any circumstance&quot; for Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich acknowledged that Freddie Mac hired his consulting group but he said it was only for strategic advice and broadening contacts among conservatives, not lobbying.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn rating Gingrich&rsquo;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-said-he-never-lobbied-freddie-mac-un/\">Half True</a>, PolitiFact National said he was technically correct but took pains to avoid being subject to the lobbying rules and use his influence as an adviser.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson appears to have taken similar pains. He told us Akin Gump wanted him to register as a lobbyist, but he refused.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe is far less definitive when asked directly if he has ever contacted a legislator on behalf of any corporate client to urge action on a bill. He first told us he didn&rsquo;t think he had, but then said couched it to say he couldn&rsquo;t say for sure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot exactly a denial.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde claims Thompson was a corporate lobbyist and has even lobbied during the current campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy the official definition, Hovde is off. Thompson is not a registered lobbyist and the the only significant evidence of direct contact with an elected official is the North Carolina example.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the other hand, it&rsquo;s clear that Thompson has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs with the Gingrich claim, we rate this one Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-09T16:42:49.161715", "ruling_date": "2012-08-10T13:26:42", "ruling_headline": "Eric Hovde says Tommy Thompson is \u201ca big corporate lobbyist\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "eric-hovde-says-tommy-thompson-big-corporate-lobby", "ruling_link_text": "Not officially a lobbyist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWTAQ Radio, The Jerry Bader Show, <a href=\"http://wtaq.com/podcasts/jerry-bader-show/eric-hovde-responds-attacks/\">&quot;Eric Hovde Responds to Attacks</a>,&quot;
