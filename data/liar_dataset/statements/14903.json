We are working hard to bring this rate down even further.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The president himself echoed the talking point in his own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950371619247153154?s=03\">tweet</a> Jan. 8: &quot;African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! &nbsp;#NeverForget &nbsp;@foxandfriends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>How accurate is the president&rsquo;s tweet? He&rsquo;s right on the numbers but leaves out economic gains for those groups under Democratic control.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unemployment rates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2017, African-American unemployment fell to 6.8 percent. That&rsquo;s a record low since the statistic was first calculated in 1972. The previous record low was 7 percent in April 2000 and September 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hispanic unemployment also dropped by a full percentage point, from 5.9 percent in December 2016 to 4.9 percent in December 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the president said, this is close to the data point&rsquo;s all-time low, which was 4.8 percent in October and November 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did Democrats do &quot;nothing&quot; for black and Hispanic unemployment?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweet would have been accurate if Trump had stopped after the numbers. But his dig on the Democrats marred his talking point. The unemployment rate for both groups declined dramatically on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, when Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hispanic unemployment, meanwhile, peaked at 13 percent in August 2009, then fell to 5.9 percent at the end of Obama&rsquo;s term in January 2017 -- also a drop of more than half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that presidents don&rsquo;t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House did not reply to an inquiry for this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump tweeted, &quot;African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right about the low unemployment rates for both blacks and Hispanics today. But his slam that the Democrats &quot;did nothing&quot; in this regard is an exaggeration. Under Obama, the unemployment rate for both groups fell by more than half. We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-08T11:55:47.770286", "ruling_date": "2018-01-08T13:25:51", "ruling_headline": "How accurate is Donald Trump about black, Hispanic unemployment?", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-accurate-donald-trumps-about-black-hispa", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers are right; criticism of Democratic record isn't", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/950371619247153154?s=03\">tweet</a>, Jan. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ivanka Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/949334430157549570?s=03\">tweet</a>, Jan 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006\">Unemployment Rate: Black or African American</a>, accessed Jan. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, &quot;<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000009\">Unemployment Rate: Hispanic or Latino</a>,&quot; accessed Jan. 8, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country.
