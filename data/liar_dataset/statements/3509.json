But we remember our article about Kloppenburg&rsquo;s prejudging claim. It was published just two days before the forum was held.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis was our conclusion:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to (Gov. Scott Walker) and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a &lsquo;complement&rsquo; to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;But Kloppenburg didn&rsquo;t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had &lsquo;prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.&rsquo; Yet she could provide no examples.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;We rate Kloppenburg&rsquo;s claim Barely True.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Kloppenburg&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, Melissa Mulliken, why Kloppenburg said we rated her claim True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&rsquo;s True and there&rsquo;s False,&quot; Mulliken said. &quot;You rated it True.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tActually, there aren&rsquo;t two, but rather six possible ratings on the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarely True, which is what we concluded about Kloppenburg&rsquo;s prejudging claim, is a statement that &quot;contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a long way from True, which means a statement &quot;is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the opposite end of the meter from True is Pants on Fire, for a statement that is ridiculously false.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Pants on Fire is what Kloppenburg gets for her claim about our earlier ruling.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-31T19:04:08.967282", "ruling_date": "2011-04-01T07:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg says PolitiFact Wisconsin \u201cconcluded that the charge that Justice Prosser prejudges matters that come before the court is True\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "supreme-court-candidate-joanne-kloppenburg-says-po", "ruling_link_text": "Umm.
