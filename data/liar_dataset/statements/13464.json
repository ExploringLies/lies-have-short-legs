I wonder if it will change - doubt it?&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/797812048805695488\">Trump tweeted</a> Nov. 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s tweet is a distorted and over-the-top description of a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/elections/to-our-readers-from-the-publisher-and-executive-editor.html?_r=1\">Nov. 13 letter to readers</a> from the <em>New York Times</em>&rsquo; publisher and executive editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 200-word letter primarily serves to thank readers for their loyalty and to say that <em>New York Times </em>will &quot;rededicate&quot; itself to the high journalistic standards it has employed thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowhere in the letter did the authors write anything like an apology. Nor did they say that the organization&rsquo;s overall coverage of Trump was &quot;bad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said Trump was referring to the fact that the letter includes an admission that the <em>New York Times</em> underestimated Trump&rsquo;s chances. The letter said the outcome was &quot;unexpected&quot; and posed&nbsp;the rhetorical question: &quot;Did Donald Trump&rsquo;s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At times during the election, the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;presidential poll&nbsp;forecast <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html\">predicted</a> Hillary Clinton had more than a 90 percent chance of winning the election, and that turned out to be incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Doesn&rsquo;t that speak volumes about the coverage?&quot; Cheung said of the inaccurate predictions at the <em>New York Times</em> and elsewhere. &quot;It wasn&rsquo;t just a disservice to President-elect Trump, but it&rsquo;s also a disservice to the voters looking for reliable coverage &mdash; which they obviously didn&rsquo;t get during the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But predictions and polling are just two aspects of the <em>New York Times</em>&rsquo; Trump coverage throughout the campaign season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also broke <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html\">the story that he likely didn&rsquo;t pay federal income taxes</a> for years, on top of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\">stories about women</a> who claimed Trump groped them. On the other side, the <em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html\">broke the news</a> that Clinton used a private email server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter from publisher Arthur Sulzberger&nbsp;Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet praised the organization&rsquo;s work overall. It said reporters consistently covered the election &quot;with agility and creativity&quot; and that they will cover the new president with &quot;the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence&quot; that they already do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s a stretch to say the letter&rsquo;s line about an inaccurate prediction is an admission of &quot;bad coverage&quot; of Trump overall, nor is it an apology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the <em>New York Times</em> told PolitiFact: &quot;We&#39;re incredibly proud of our coverage of the 2016 campaign. There was no suggestion either in our <a href=\"http://www.nytco.com/arthur-sulzberger-jr-s-note-to-staff-of-the-new-york-times/\">note to staff</a>, or the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/elections/to-our-readers-from-the-publisher-and-executive-editor.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">note to subscribers</a>, that we were apologizing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, the <em>New York Times</em> and other media outlets are reflecting on their coverage from the year and why they so underestimated Trump&rsquo;s support. The <em>New York Times</em> public editor Liz Spayd, for example, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/public-editor/want-to-know-what-americas-thinking-try-asking.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">wrote Nov. 9</a> that reporters could have done more to immerse themselves in Trump supporters&rsquo; lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> sent a letter to subscribers thanking them for their loyalty and promising to provide strong coverage of Trump going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the letter does note that the <em>New York Times</em> underestimated support for Trump, it does not say their coverage of him throughout the campaign was bad. In fact, the letter praises <em>New York Times</em> reporters&rsquo; work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The note does not include any semblance of an apology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f2054f27-8478-407c-9196-35f65372025d\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f2054f27-8478-407c-9196-35f65372025d</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-15T10:26:44.826858", "ruling_date": "2016-11-15T11:18:19", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says New York Times apologized for 'bad coverage' of him", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-says-new-york-times-apologized-bad-co", "ruling_link_text": "That's not what it said", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/us/elections/to-our-readers-from-the-publisher-and-executive-editor.html?_r=1\">To Our Readers, From the Publisher and Executive Editor,</a>&quot; Nov. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/public-editor/want-to-know-what-americas-thinking-try-asking.html?smid=tw-share\">Want to Know What America&rsquo;s Thinking?
