We were able to verify that statistic <a href=\"http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=1866&amp;Itemid=3904&amp;lang=en\">here</a>; officially, the number is 1.3 million annually, or just over 3,000 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s office has changed the text in the Medium article to &quot;more than 1,600&quot; during the course of our reporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also inserted the following correction: &quot;*The initial number provided for daily cancer deaths in the United States was 3,000\u200a&mdash;\u200a<a href=\"http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=1866&amp;Itemid=3904&amp;lang=en\">which is roughly the number of daily cancer deaths across the broader Americas</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden said in his Vatican speech that &quot;in the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s the number of deaths for the Americas as a whole, not for just the United States. After we contacted Biden&rsquo;s office, they changed the number listed in the Medium article to the correct number, &quot;more than 1,600.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we laud speedy corrections, it is PolitiFact&rsquo;s policy to rate statements on the Truth-O-Meter in their initial version, which, in this case, could not be corrected in its original setting, a high-profile international speech.
