It&#39;s a number that has been used in so many descriptions of suffering fans (&quot;86 years of despair and disappointment&quot; . . . &quot;86-year drought&quot; . . . &quot;86 long and depressing years&quot;) that it&#39;s iconic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDo a Google search on the phrase &quot;86 years,&quot; as we did, and five of the first 10 listings relate to the Red Sox.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut when Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a self-described &quot;true-suffering fan&quot; of the Sox, spoke about his team at the CNN/YouTube debate on Nov. 28, 2007, he used a different number:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEighty-seven.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact, he used the wrong number twice in a row.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Eighty-seven long years,&quot; Romney said. &quot;We waited 87 long years.
