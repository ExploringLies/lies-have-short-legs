Mike Gravel attacked the Iraq war during a recent debate by highlighting the increasing costs.\n<p>\n \"Stop and think,\" he said at Howard University on June 28, 2007. \"When he's talking about the money we're squandering, 21-million Americans could have a four-year college scholarship for the money we've squandered in Iraq. 7.6-million teachers could have been hired last year if we weren't squandering this money.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Gravel's campaign staff didn't respond to numerous requests for documentation supporting those numbers. They couldn't even say how much they think the Iraq war costs.\n</p>\n<p>\n But we researched the numbers anyway and found that in making his comparison he goes too high on one and too low on the other. Ruling? Half true.\n</p>\n<p>\n We interpreted his assertion to mean that the Iraq war budget would pay for the scholarships or the teachers' salaries, rather than both.\n</p>\n<p>\n The College Board puts the average cost of tuition for a four-year public university in 2006 at $5,836. Do the math: the sum exceeds $490.2-billion, much higher than even the highest estimate.\n</p>\n<p>\n The U.S. Department of Education reports the average teacher salary was $47,750 in 2005, the most recent year available. That produces a total of $363-billion, well below the lowest estimate.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates the entire bill for the Iraq war since 2001 is $413-billion. The Congressional research did its own calculation to show that the price tag to date is $450.4-billion.\n</p>\n<p>\n So Gravel's comparisons are at once exaggerated and underestimated, but they are within the same range of the projected costs.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:37.040539", "ruling_date": "2007-09-20T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "He's high, then he's low.", "ruling_headline_slug": "hes-high-then-hes-low", "ruling_link_text": "He's high, then he's low.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Congressional Research Service,<a href=\"http://www. fas.org/sgp/crs/natsex/RL33110.pdf\"> The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11</a> July 16, 2007.<p>\r\nCongressional Budget Office testimony, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/84xx/doc8497/07-30-WarCosts_Testimony.pdf\"> Estimated Costs of U.S. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and of Other Activities Related to the War on Terrorism</a> July 31, 2007.<p>\r\nOffice of Managment and Budget, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pdf/defense-2008.pdf\">Department of Defense 2008 Fact Sheet</a><p>\r\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies, <a href=\"http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/080907_thecostsofwar.pdf\"> The Uncertain Cost of the Global War on Terror</a> August 2007.<p>\r\nThe Brookings Institution, <a href=\"http://www3.brookings.edu/fp/saban/iraq/index.pdf\"> Iraq Index</a><p> Aug. 27, 2007\r\nLinda Bilmes and Joseph E.
