That&rsquo;s the projection for the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWalker himself has settled on $137 million as the deficit figure, a number reporters have adopted as shorthand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe re-read the fiscal bureau memo, talked to Lang, consulted reporter Jason Stein of the Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s Madison Bureau, read various news accounts and examined the issue in detail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur conclusion: Maddow and the others are wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is, indeed, a projected deficit that required attention, and Walker and GOP lawmakers did not create it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore on that second point in a bit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe confusion, it appears, stems from a section in Lang&rsquo;s memo that -- read on its own -- does project a $121 million surplus in the state&rsquo;s general fund as of June 30, 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the remainder of the routine memo -- consider it the fine print -- outlines $258 million in unpaid bills or expected shortfalls in programs such as Medicaid services for the needy ($174 million alone), the public defender&rsquo;s office and corrections. Additionally, the state owes Minnesota $58.7 million under a discontinued tax reciprocity deal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe result, by our math and Lang&rsquo;s, is the $137 million shortfall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would be closer to the $340 million figure if the figure included the $200 million owed to the state&rsquo;s patient compensation fund, a debt courts have declared resulted from an illegal raid on the fund under former Gov. Jim Doyle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA court ruling is pending in that matter, so the money might not have to be transferred until next budget year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo be sure, the projected shortfall is a modest one by the standards of the last decade, which saw a $600 million repair bill one year as the economy and national tax collections slumped.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut ignoring it would have meant turning away eligible Medicaid clients, which was not an option, Lang said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis same situation has happened in the past, including during the tenure of Doyle, a Democrat. In January 2005, a fiscal bureau memo showed a similar surplus, but lawmakers approved a major fix of a Medicaid shortfall that would have eaten up that projected surplus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReporters who cover the Capitol are used to doing the math to come up with the bottom-line surplus or deficit, but average readers are not. (The Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s Stein addressed these and other budget questions in a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/116480323.html\">follow-up story</a>.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why does Lang write his biennial memo in a way that invites confusion?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLang, a veteran and respected civil servant working in a nonpartisan job, told us he does not want to presume what legislative or other action will be taken to address the potential shortfalls he lists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdmittedly, the approach this time created the opportunity for a snappy -- and powerful -- political attack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it is an inaccurate one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, what about Maddow&rsquo;s claim -- also repeated across the liberal blogosphere -- that Walker&rsquo;s tax-cut bills approved in January are responsible for the $137 million deficit?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLang&rsquo;s fiscal bureau report and news accounts addressed that issue as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tax cuts will cost the state a projected $140 million in tax revenue -- but not until the next two-year budget, from July 2011 to June 2013. The cuts are not even in effect yet, so they cannot be part of the current problem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s the bottom line:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is fierce debate over the approach Walker took to address the short-term budget deficit. But there should be no debate on whether or not there is a shortfall. While not historically large, the shortfall in the current budget needed to be addressed in some fashion. Walker&rsquo;s tax cuts will boost the size of the projected deficit in the next budget, but they&rsquo;re not part of this problem and did not create it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rate Maddow&rsquo;s take False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-18T18:57:39.604559", "ruling_date": "2011-02-18T17:56:54", "ruling_headline": "Rachel Maddow says Wisconsin is on track to have a budget surplus this year", "ruling_headline_slug": "rachel-maddow-says-wisconsin-track-have-budget-sur", "ruling_link_text": "On this one, you have to read the fine print", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Robert Lang, director, Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Feb. 18, 2011<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLegislative Fiscal Bureau, general fund projection (page 2), Jan. 31, 2011<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLegislative Fiscal Bureau, impact of special session tax cuts (page 11), Jan. 31, 2011<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel archives</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "MSNBC host", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Rachel", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "", "id": 154, "last_name": "Maddow", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "rachel-maddow", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/maddow.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/154/", "total_count": 29, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Despite what you may have heard about Wisconsin&rsquo;s finances, Wisconsin is on track to have a budget surplus this year.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a segment on her television talk show", "statement_date": "2011-02-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 192, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/192/", "subject": "Labor", "subject_slug": "labor", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
