Republicans wanted about $61 billion, while Democrats hoped for $33 billion. They reached a deal for roughly $39 billion in cuts late Friday night, about an hour before a federal shutdown.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey also played the blame game. Democrats and Republicans spent the days before the shutdown trying to convince the public that whatever happened, it was the other party&rsquo;s fault.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an April 1 speech before Congress, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun played pin the blame on the donkey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s pitiful that the Democrats have wasted so much time stalling over these minimal cuts in their own self-interest while our country is financially bleeding to death,&quot; the Athens Republican said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We should be focused on trying to revive our economy rather than bickering about $61 billion dollars when we already borrow almost $60 billion per week.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal government borrows $60 billion per week? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBroun was one of four members of the 13-member Georgia congressional delegation who rejected Friday&rsquo;s budget compromise. Republican Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger and Democratic Reps. John Lewis of Atlanta and Hank Johnson of Lithonia joined him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican dissenters thought the cuts didn&rsquo;t go far enough. Democrats thought they were too deep. Neither camp had much impact. The House voted 348-70 to accept the deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore information about Broun&rsquo;s spending figures were close at hand. A pair of deficit hawks, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., barnstormed Atlanta on Monday to explain why Congress needs to cut the deficit soon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia marked the occasion by fact checking an op-ed they co-wrote that claimed &quot;An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt&quot; every day. We rated the claim Mostly True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is what we determined:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion of the $14.25 trillion debt is held by the public. The rest is money the government loans to itself. Both measures of the federal debt are valid.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBetween the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt had risen by an average of slightly more than $4 billion a day. This year, the debt has risen by about $2.6 billion a day.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe total debt&rsquo;s average daily increase for that same time period was about $4.3 billion. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese figures show Broun&rsquo;s claim that the government borrows &quot;$60 billion&quot; each week misses the mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe debt held by the public grew on average about $28 billion per week between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011. The total debt grew by about $30.1 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis year, the weekly growth has declined to $17.15 billion or $21 billion, depending on which debt measure you use. Neither comes close to $60 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Broun&rsquo;s office about the discrepancy. Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti said he must have misspoke. Broun meant to say that the federal government borrows nearly $60 billion every two weeks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Broun got his numbers wrong, we rate his claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-12T14:26:08.332831", "ruling_date": "2011-04-13T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Rep.
