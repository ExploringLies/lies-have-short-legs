This is way beyond what happened in the nation during this period of time.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his eight years in office, federal records do show that rates of violent and property crime in New York dropped as sharply as he claims. It is also true that those rates of decline outpaced national averages, and that New York boasted a low violent crime rate compared to the biggest big cities, like Los Angeles and Houston.\n<p>\n But his claims do come with some caveats: Numerous studies have failed to show that the politicies of Giuiliani and his police commanders were directly responsible for the decline in crime.\n</p>\n<p>\n Crime rates dropped nationwide during those years, 1994-2001, and most large cities saw significant declines; San Francisco, in fact, enjoyed the steepest drop in violent crime. And, significantly, violent crime rates in New York City had been falling for three years before he took office.\n</p>\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:33.830718", "ruling_date": "2007-10-26T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "He's got his numbers right", "ruling_headline_slug": "hes-got-his-numbers-right", "ruling_link_text": "He's got his numbers right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<a href=\"http://bjsdata.ojp.usdoj.gov/dataonline/Search/Crime/Crime.cfm\">\n U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics\n</a>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "Attorney", "false_count": 11, "first_name": "Rudy", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "New York", "id": 13, "last_name": "Giuliani", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "rudy-giuliani", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-rudygiuliani.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/13/", "total_count": 50, "true_count": 8, "website": ""}, "statement": "\"Fifty-six percent decline in overall crime.
