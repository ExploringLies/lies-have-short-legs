While proponents of the policy shift argue that the changes won&rsquo;t spur additional fees or taxes, opponents argue the opposite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on,&quot; Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an email through the anti-FCC regulation group <a href=\"https://www.protectinternetfreedom.com/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Protect Internet Freedom</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, FCC spokesperson Kim Hart told PolitiFact that the policy &quot;does not raise taxes or fees. Period.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who&rsquo;s right here? Estimates of the impact on consumers -- in terms of Internet service bill fees and taxes -- range from $0 to $11 billion. Politicians can make a case that the policy will bump up service bills for the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/acs/acs-28.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>85 million households</u></a> with Internet, but there are too many unknowns to make such a definitive statement as Lee&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The proposal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/nov/13/what-net-neutrality/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Net neutrality</u></a> is complicated. In general, it&rsquo;s the idea that Internet service providers (like Comcast) should not be able give preferential treatment to one website over another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, the solution is also complex. The FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the <a href=\"http://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Telecommunications Act</u></a>, meaning they will be treated as public utilities, like phone service -- subject to more regulation than they are now. (A previous <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/13/ted-cruz/cruz-net-neutrality-regulations-put-government-cha/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fact-check</u></a> covered this in more detail.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full text of the proposal <a href=\"http://www.techpolicydaily.com/communications/writing-net-neutrality-rules-dark/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>wasn&rsquo;t availabl</u></a>e to the public before the vote, when Lee made his comments, though its general principles were widely understood. But, a <a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-wheeler-proposes-new-rules-protecting-open-internet\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fact sheet</u></a> says it &quot;will not impose, suggest or authorize any new taxes or fees.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, Congress recently reauthorized the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans new taxes on Internet service. There&rsquo;s legislation <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/232332-40-senators-push-long-term-ban-on-internet-tax\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>in the works</u></a> to make this law permanent. That means the FCC couldn&#39;t levy taxes on its own even if it wanted to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a big caveat, though. The Internet Tax Freedom Act bans taxes, but not fees. Fee revenue is set aside specifically for, in this case, a telecom-related service. Taxes, in contrast, raise general revenue. They&rsquo;re legally different, but functionally the same from the consumer&rsquo;s perspective. Many experts say consumers can expect additional fees<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/document/fact-sheet-president-obamas-plan-regulate-internet\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Some say</u></a> the FCC has left the door open for attaching federal-level fees in the future. Regardless, the FCC can&rsquo;t stop states and municipalities from tacking on their own fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The estimates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide annual impact on Internet broadband subscriber bills could reach a maximum $11 billion, as a result of new taxes and fees, according to a December report out of the <a href=\"http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014.12-Litan-Singer_Outdated-Regulations-Will-Make-Consumers-Pay-More-for-Broadband.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Progressive Policy Institute</u></a>, a center-left think tank (it identifies with former President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s New Democrats). They recently lowered their estimate from $15 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the study, the researchers assumed that state and local governments would take every fee currently applied to a telecom service and apply them to internet service -- because household Internet will become a telecom service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the state of California charges telecom companies fees for special telecom-related services for the deaf and disabled, among other programs. Companies then pass these fees along to consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It makes sense that a state would want to apply already-established telecom fees to Internet service to increase revenue, said study author Hal Singer, in an interview with PolitiFact. He pointed out that Vermont&rsquo;s director of telecom services <a href=\"http://digital.vpr.net/post/under-new-fcc-standard-30-percent-vermonters-now-lack-broadband\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>has said</u></a> the state would strongly consider levying fees on broadband Internet for the purpose of increasing Internet accessibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some net neutrality experts take issue with the study because of what the authors chose to include or leave out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The PPI study has been thoroughly discredited,&quot; said Joshua Stager, policy counsel at the Open Technology Institute, noting that it was &quot;disingenuous&quot; of the study to ignore the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no guarantee that every state would choose to levy every fee. In some states, the legislatures would have to take action before it could happen.&nbsp;The report also assumes that federal fees will apply, but that&rsquo;s still up in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a different look at the PPI findings, the <a href=\"http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/12/02/claims-real-net-neutrality-would-result-new-internet-tax-skew-math-and-confuse-law\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Free Press</u></a> advocacy group argues that the potential fee burden could be around $4 billion, or as little as nothing. (Though Singer <a href=\"http://www.progressivepolicy.org/issues/economy/no-guarantees-when-it-comes-to-telecom-fees/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fervently rebutts</u></a> their argument.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal finance website <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/economics/net-neutrality/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nerd Wallet</u></a> did their own assessment and settled on a possible $6.25 billion impact. They broke their estimates down by state and found that households would see an annual increase in their Internet service bills anywhere between $8 in Delaware and $131 in Pennsylvania. They estimate that the average American household will see their bill increase $67 annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;d say claiming that this order will be a &lsquo;massive tax on the middle class,&rsquo; is an overstatement,&quot; said Doug Brake, telecom policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. &quot;But it is also true that we will likely see new fees on broadband as a result of reclassification.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee said the FCC&rsquo;s net neutrality policy &quot;is essentially a massive tax increase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literally, there won&rsquo;t be any new taxes as a result of the FCC changes, but there will likely be additional fees. There&rsquo;s a wide range of estimates -- anywhere from zero to $11 billion a year. Lee&rsquo;s comment doesn&rsquo;t account for the fact that the impact on consumers&rsquo; service bills is far from certain, and a telecom policy analyst said it&#39;s an overstatement to call the potential increases &quot;massive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-25T12:56:42.968750", "ruling_date": "2015-02-26T14:11:15", "ruling_headline": "Effect of net neutrality rules on taxes is uncertain", "ruling_headline_slug": "effect-net-neutrality-rules-taxes-uncertain", "ruling_link_text": "Fees, not taxes, and some are modest", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Protect Internet Freedom, mass email, Feb. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Progressive Policy Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014.12-Litan-Singer_Outdated-Regulations-Will-Make-Consumers-Pay-More-for-Broadband.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Outdated Regulations Will Make Consumers Pay More for Broadband,</u></a>&quot; December 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PPI, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.progressivepolicy.org/issues/economy/no-guarantees-when-it-comes-to-telecom-fees/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>No Guarantees When It Comes to Telecom Fees</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/internet-taxes-another-window-into-the-net-neutrality-debate/?ref=topics&amp;_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Internet Taxes, Another Window Into the Net Neutrality Debate,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech Policy Daily, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.techpolicydaily.com/internet/title-ii-new-way-collect-fees-broadband/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=blogtweets&amp;utm_campaign=cict\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Title II: A new way to collect fees on broadband,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nerd Wallet, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/economics/net-neutrality/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Net Neutrality &mdash; FCC Regulation Could Cost Consumers $6 Billion</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/halsinger/2015/02/24/a-political-miscalculation-on-net-neutrality/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>A Political Miscalculation on Net Neutrality</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/13/ted-cruz/cruz-net-neutrality-regulations-put-government-cha/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ted Cruz: Net neutrality regulations put government in charge of Internet prices, services,</u></a>&quot; Nov. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/acs/acs-28.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Computer and Internet Use in the United States: 2013,</u></a>&quot; November 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/232332-40-senators-push-long-term-ban-on-internet-tax\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>40 senators push long-term ban on Internet tax,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FCC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/document/fact-sheet-president-obamas-plan-regulate-internet\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fact Sheet: President Obama&#39;s Plan to Regulate the Internet,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FCC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-wheeler-proposes-new-rules-protecting-open-internet\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Chairman Wheeler Proposes New Rules for Protecting the Open Internet</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mother Jones</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/net-neutrality-taxes-mike-lee-fact-check\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Republicans Claim Net Neutrality Will Mean Billions in New Taxes.
