Each of the three candidates urged their own form of a robust response. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., underscored the need to rethink how the nation spends its counterterrorism dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This nation is the most powerful military in the world,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;We&#39;re spending over $600 billion a year on the military. And yet significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to fight international terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to explore that &quot;less than 10 percent&quot; figure. The Sanders campaign told us that Sanders was talking about the <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2015/10/27/the-pentagon-doesnt-deserve-more-money-from-debt-ceiling-deal\">budget to fight the Islamic State</a> group, otherwise known as ISIS or ISIL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The president&#39;s request for the war on Islamic State group was just $5.3 billion for next year, or less than 10 percent of the war budget,&quot; spokesman Warren Gunnels said.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But international terrorism is broader than the specific fight against ISIS. The Defense Department includes its operations in Afghanistan as part of the fight against terrorism. The 2015 <a href=\"http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2016/FY2016_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Defense Department budget</u></a> puts total spending at $560 billion, of which the Pentagon says about$60 billion went toward operations aimed at combatting terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s nearly 11 percent of the military budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all of that money, about $55 billion, was spent in Afghanistan &quot;with a focus on training, advising, and assisting the Afghan forces and carrying out counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda in coordination with Afghan forces,&quot; as the Pentagon budget writers put it in their 2016 budget request. The remainder went toward fighting the Islamic State group, otherwise known as ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that the country spends billions more to fight<strong> </strong>terrorism, but those dollars show up outside the military budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/pages/attachments/2015/02/02/24._federal_bureau_of_investigation_fbi.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Decision Unit</u></a> spent about $3.3 billion in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know how much was spent by the CIA and the National Security Agency. However, in 2013, documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden pointed to <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/09/11/u-s-spends-over-16-billion-annually-on-counter-terrorism/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>over $16 billion</u></a> in spending to combat terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we add in those amounts, then the total rises to well above Sanders&rsquo; figure. However, his comparison was solely in the context of defense spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Finlay is the president of the Stimson Center, a defense policy group in Washington. Finlay told us that Sanders&rsquo; focus on the direct attacks unleashed on ISIS misses a great deal of the action. More subtle operations through the Defense and State departments &quot;undercut the rationale for terrorism, erode their wherewithal to undertake operations, or otherwise prevent incidents from occurring,&quot; Finlay said. &quot;This side of counterterrorism operations is every bit as important as the &lsquo;bang bang&rsquo; response.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said that the country devotes &quot;significantly less than 10 percent&quot; of its military budget to fight international terrorism. A campaign spokesman told us that Sanders was only counting money spent against ISIS. However, according to the Defense Department budget, it spent a combined total of $60 billion on anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and in the battle with ISIS. This amounts to nearly 11 percent of total defense dollars<strong>, </strong>not significantly less as Sanders said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you could argue that not all of the money going toward operations in Afghanistan is precisely aimed at counterterrorism, it is a great stretch to say that none of it should be counted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders used an overly restricted definition that also ignores that a hefty amount of counterterrorism spending takes place outside of the Defense Department. We rate his statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-15T01:09:58.963434", "ruling_date": "2015-11-15T01:14:20", "ruling_headline": "Sanders: 'Significantly less than 10%' of defense dollars go to fight terrorism", "ruling_headline_slug": "sanders-significantly-less-10-defense-dollars-go-f", "ruling_link_text": "Misses a whole lot of the picture", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CBS News, <a href=\"http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=468d5dc43334640650b81443f&amp;id=5a63807399&amp;e=6d7cef570b\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Democratic debate - Iowa</u></a>, Nov. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Defense Department, <a href=\"http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2016/FY2016_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fiscal Year 2016 budget request</u></a>, March 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Justice Department - FBI, <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/pages/attachments/2015/02/02/24._federal_bureau_of_investigation_fbi.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>FY 2016 Authorization and Budget Request to Congress</u></a>, Feb.2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/09/11/u-s-spends-over-16-billion-annually-on-counter-terrorism/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. spends over $16 billion annually on counter-terrorism</u></a>, Sept. 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. News and World Report, <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2015/10/27/the-pentagon-doesnt-deserve-more-money-from-debt-ceiling-deal\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>An Indefensible Budget Deal</u></a>, Oct.27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Brian Finlay, president, Stimson Center, Nov. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Bernie", "half_true_count": 28, "home_state": "Vermont", "id": 218, "last_name": "Sanders", "mostly_true_count": 46, "name_slug": "bernie-sanders", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "edition": "Vermont", "edition_slug": "vermont", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 65, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "Vermont Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/65/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/218/", "total_count": 129, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://sanders.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Out<strong> </strong>of the total U.S. military budget, &quot;significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to fight international terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "the Democratic debate in Iowa", "statement_date": "2015-11-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
