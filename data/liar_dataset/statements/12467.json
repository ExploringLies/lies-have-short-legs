We heard back from Todd Pack, a federation spokesman for the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pack pointed us to a 2004 <a href=\"https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/macpherson_06-2004.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> by the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank. That study crunched U.S. Census Bureau data looking at the earnings of workers from 1979 to 2002. It examined how a minimum-wage worker&rsquo;s pay in one year compared to the following year. Its conclusion:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Over the 23 years of data studied in the report, nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage employees who continue employment are earning more than the minimum wage within 1&ndash;12 months,&quot; the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll note that passage includes the qualifier that it focuses on minimum wage workers who continue working. Some low-wage workers may leave the workforce or become unemployed before they get a pay bump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the report&rsquo;s conclusion says minimum-wage employees get a pay bump based on their hard work and hence &quot;Nearly two-thirds receive a raise within a year of starting employment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One issue with the Employment Policies Institute report is its age. It looks at a time period that ended in 2002. That&rsquo;s 14 years ago and five years before the Great Recession started to grip the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more recent study examined this question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University revisited the issue as part of a broad look at the minimum wage and its effect on employment in a 2013 <a href=\"http://economics.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/files/events/Meer_West_Minimum_Wage.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>paper</u></a>. They studied Census Bureau data from 1979 through 2012 in which minimum-wage workers were asked about their earnings in an initial survey and again in a second interview a year later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The researchers found that among all minimum-wage workers, 16.55 percent of them left the labor force within a year and didn&rsquo;t try to find a new jobs, and another 5.85 percent became unemployed but sought new work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among those who remained employed, 65.85 percent were paid more than the minimum wage in the following year. The median higher pay for those workers was an additional $1 an hour, according to the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When looking at all minimum-wage workers, including those who lost a job or left the labor force altogether, about 51 percent of them were earning higher than the minimum wage after a year on the job. Jonathan Meer, a co-author of the Texas A&amp;M report and an economics professor there, told us workers who got a pay hike may have been at the same job or moved on to another employer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that the minimum wage included people who live in states that defer to the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage as well as in states that set the minimum at a higher rate. There are 29 states that have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate, but Virginia is not one of them, <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according</u></a> to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeremy West, the other co-author of the Texas A&amp;M report, updated the figures for us. He said 72 percent of all minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But about one-fifth of them got raises only because the minimum wage had been increased in their states. That means 57.5 percent of minimum wage earners got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they found higher-paying jobs between 2014 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note: Our colleagues at PunditFact back in 2014 <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/16/steve-forbes/steve-forbes-says-two-thirds-people-who-earn-minim/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>examined</u></a> a similar statement by Steve Forbes, the former GOP presidential candidate. Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, told them that people who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving they&rsquo;re dedicated employees who can hold jobs and that might speak more to why they&rsquo;re getting a raise than anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for those minimum-wage workers who instead leave the labor force entirely, they might be choosing to do so because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, Sinclair told PunditFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Federation of Independent Business here in Virginia says on its website that &quot;the vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group finds support from an older report from 12 years ago that says two-thirds of workers who stayed on the job got a raise within a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent numbers show that 72 percent of minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But one-fifth of them got the boost only because their state had raised its minimum wage - a step the NFIB opposes. That means 57.5 percent of the workers got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they had found better-paying jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d50a0a2-974e-4229-bf51-191c8b60d9b2\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d50a0a2-974e-4229-bf51-191c8b60d9b2</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-02T09:06:07.359681", "ruling_date": "2016-06-02T09:02:27", "ruling_headline": "NFIB says 'vast majority' of minimum wage workers get raise in a year", "ruling_headline_slug": "nfib-says-vast-majority-minimum-wage-workers-get-r", "ruling_link_text": "This majority isn't 'vast' ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>National Federation of Independent Business in Virginia <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/virginia/news-information/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>website</u></a>, accessed May 17, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Federation of Independent Business, <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/content/resources/alabama/infographic-minimum-wage-myths-busted-73957/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Infographic: Minimum wage myths busted,&quot;</u></a> accessed May 17, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Todd Pack, spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, May 17, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employment Policies Institute, <a href=\"https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/macpherson_06-2004.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Wage growth among minimum wage workers,&quot;</u></a> June 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/16/steve-forbes/steve-forbes-says-two-thirds-people-who-earn-minim/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Steve Forbes says two-thirds of people who earn the minimum wage get a raise within one year,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 16, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas A&amp;M University, <a href=\"http://economics.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/files/events/Meer_West_Minimum_Wage.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Effects of the minimum wage on employment dynamics,&quot;</u></a> December 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jonathan Meer, associate professor of economics at Texas A&amp;M University, May 25, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice of San Diego, <a href=\"http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/2014/02/10/fact-check-pay-hikes-for-minimum-wage-workers/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Fact Check: Pay hikes for minimum wage workers,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 10, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Conference of State Legislatures, <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;State minimum wages,&quot;</u></a> April 14, 2016.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 3539, "last_name": "National Federation of Independent Business-Virginia ", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "nfederation-o-independent-business-virginia", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/generic_group_photo_4.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3539/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a website post.", "statement_date": "2016-05-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 29, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/29/", "subject": "Poverty", "subject_slug": "poverty", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
