We found that he accurately cited ICE numbers. But data also showed that the most common charges and convictions were for traffic offenses, immigration, and &quot;dangerous drugs.&quot; Pence&rsquo;s wording could leave the wrong impression that those criminal convictions were for more serious offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least 226,119 people were deported by ICE in fiscal year 2017, according to the agency. (Fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, so it included nearly four months of the Obama administration.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICE deported more people the year before, at 240,255. But ICE <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2017/iceEndOfYearFY2017.pdf\">said</a> the proportion of removals due to ICE arrests was greater in 2017 than in 2016.
