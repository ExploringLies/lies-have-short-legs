Scott Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/118842999.html\">announced</a> March 29, 2011, he would seek federal funding for upgrades to Amtrak&rsquo;s Hiawatha train service between Chicago and Milwaukee, it stirred plenty of attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter all, Walker was asking the feds for a portion of the same $810 million in stimulus money for a Milwaukee-to-Madison high-speed rail link he campaigned against, and then refused. And some of the money for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee upgrades was included in the earlier grant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Hiawatha makes seven round trips a day between Milwaukee and Chicago and has seen steadily increasing ridership, with 741,000 passengers in 2010. Wisconsin is seeking $150 million to buy two additional train sets and eight locomotives as part of the upgrades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong others, Milwaukee Ald. Bob Bauman, a supporter of the original grant, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/118842999.html\">criticized</a> Walker for seeking the new money, calling the move &quot;rank hypocrisy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did Walker change his tune on trains?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTime for a visit to the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter doesn&rsquo;t measure whether any change in position was good policy -- or good politics. It just looks at whether a politician has been consistent along the way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this case, we are focusing on the statements that relate to the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link and the use of stimulus money for it. Walker intertwined the two when he announced the application.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs with the Madison-to-Milwaukee link, the stimulus money is for high-speed rail service, though the upgrades that have been discussed would not bring to that status until years from now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, there are numerous ironies involved in the hotly debated issue, from Walker&rsquo;s past criticism of the federal stimulus program in general to now seeking some of the money he once rejected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, a portion of the federal money Walker is now seeking would be used to build a maintenance facility in Milwaukee at the Talgo factory in Milwaukee. Talgo is the company that had a contract to build the trains that would run between Milwaukee and Madison -- a contract Walker criticized in 2010 as a gubernatorial candidate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the federal government yanked funding for the Milwaukee-to-Madison project because of Walker&rsquo;s opposition, Talgo said it would complete work already under way and then move production work out of Milwaukee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, the Talgo factory is a key part of Walker&rsquo;s plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new state application includes $50 million to $60 million for the maintenance facility. That&rsquo;s up from $30 million that the state previously agreed to spend on the facility. Walker says spending more on the maintenance facility will save state taxpayers $20 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the reasoning:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s existing contract with Talgo committed the state to spending at least $30 million on a maintenance base. That was to have been located in Madison, as part of the now-dead train service. The new application calls for a bigger facility at the Talgo plant in Milwaukee. Walker wants the feds to pay at least 80 percent, or $48 million, toward the base. The state would pay $10 million to $12 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker spokesman Cullen Werwie said that means taxpayers are saving between $18 million and $20 million, because if the state does nothing, it&rsquo;s already on the hook for $30 million under the previous deal with Talgo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course, Wisconsin residents who pay federal taxes would still be doing their part to foot the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s return to the core question: With the new application, did Walker switch tracks?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker certainly didn&rsquo;t want to extend the service to Madison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he and virtually everyone else -- including Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and the business community -- likes the Milwaukee-to-Chicago service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere are a couple of examples of what Walker said about that train:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIn September 2010, he <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/102486999.html\">told</a> the Journal Sentinel: &quot;I will continue state support for the Hiawatha, but believe the state simply cannot afford to take on additional maintenance costs for new rail lines.&quot;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIn November 2010, Walker he reiterated that point, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/108232259.html\">saying</a> in an interview with Mike Gousha of WISN-TV he backed continued state support for the Hiawatha. He also said he&rsquo;d prefer spending the rejected train money for highways but added he and his staff &quot;looked at options relative to rail,&quot; and mentioned the Milwaukee-to-Chicago line.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndeed, in his news release announcing the application, Walker framed the new application as a money saver -- in contrast to his view the Milwaukee-to-Madison extension was a money loser for the state, which would have had to pay an ongoing subsidy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, there&rsquo;s nothing inconsistent on this part of the question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what about the use of federal stimulus money?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn February 2009, Walker was critical of the stimulus program in an opinion <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123578396175298389.html\">piece </a>in the Wall Street Journal, saying: &quot;As popular as the federal &lsquo;stimulus&rsquo; package is with Washington politicians, it is more popular among state and local politicians who view federal money as a cure for their fiscal woes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the piece, Walker -- then Milwaukee County executive -- said he would refuse to make a list of projects he would seek to fund with stimulus cash.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/37363494.html\">earlier </a>opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker pushed some of the same themes, but said infrastructure projects &quot;may be worth considering&quot; if several criteria -- such as no local match requirement -- were met.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose statements both came in early 2009 -- a year before the state&rsquo;s application for high-speed train money was awarded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the context of that debate, in at least one spot -- the interview with Gousha -- Walker talked about the possibility of using the rejected money for the Milwaukee-to-Chicago line.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, while Walker took a stance broadly against the stimulus program -- and scored some political points for doing so -- he also left himself some wiggle room, specifically when it came to the $810 million high-speed rail grant that started this whole debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat may be shrewd politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that doesn&rsquo;t make it inconsistent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, he had not ruled out any use of stimulus money and was on the record as supporting using it for the Chicago-to-Milwaukee link before the new application was announced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this No Flip.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-12T14:49:49.123509", "ruling_date": "2011-04-13T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Twists and turns, but No Flip on central funding question", "ruling_headline_slug": "Twists-and-turns-but-no-flip-on-central-funding-qu", "ruling_link_text": "Lots of twists in this saga, but was consistent on core issues involved in new application", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tEmails, Cullen Werwie, spokesman, Gov.
