Rick Perry draws  mention in GOP consultant Karl Rove&rsquo;s autobiography with  attention focused on Perry&rsquo;s win for lieutenant governor in 1998 and  Rove's role in his pivotal earlier switch from the Democratic to  Republican party while he was a third-term member of the Texas House.</p>\r\n<p>Rove writes: &ldquo;Rick Perry had planned to retire from the legislature  until his best friend, David Weeks, and I talked him into switching  parties and running for the GOP nomination for agriculture  commissioner.&rdquo; His book, \"Courage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in the Fight,\" was published March 9.</p>\r\n<p>We wondered if Perry&rsquo;s 1989 party shift and his  1990 challenge to Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower played out so  simply.</p>\r\n<p>Perry didn&rsquo;t comment, but Weeks, a long-time Perry  friend who&rsquo;s been a consultant in Perry&rsquo;s statewide campaigns, said  Perry was seriously considering retirement, perhaps to become a  lobbyist, partly because his wife, Anita, was saddled with raising their  young children at the time.</p>\r\n<p>Weeks said Rove was part of a group  of Republicans who encouraged Perry to switch parties and make the  statewide run. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t the only one,&rdquo; Weeks said.</p>\r\n<p>Published  stories also single out Weeks and Rove.</p>\r\n<p>Perry considered working  as a lobbyist or high-level Capitol aide rather than leaving Austin  entirely, according to a February article in the Austin  American-Statesman. Instead, Weeks and others encouraged him to run for  ag commissioner, the newspaper said. Perry told the Statesman: &ldquo;I'll  give David the bulk of the credit. He came and sat down with me and  said, 'You ought to run for statewide office.'&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>According to a  2003 Rove profile published in Texas Monthly magazine, Rove and Weeks  &ldquo;persuaded Perry, an obscure Democratic legislator from Haskell who had  co-chaired Al Gore's 1988 Democratic presidential primary campaign in  Texas, to switch parties for the election. West Texas was swinging  Republican anyway, and Perry, who was discouraged by his failure to  advance in the House leadership and thinking of becoming a lobbyist, had  nothing to lose.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The rest is dramatic Republican history:  Perry, whose advisers included Rove, upset Hightower and has now held  statewide office for nearly 20 years. Rove went on to help Bush to the  White House.</p>\r\n<p>Others were involved, though, in Perry making his  initial leap. We rate Rove&rsquo;s statement as Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-18T18:33:18.631527", "ruling_date": "2010-03-19T11:52:09", "ruling_headline": "Karl Rove says he and consultant David Weeks persuaded Rick Perry to switch parties and run for state agriculture commissioner", "ruling_headline_slug": "karl-rove-says-he-and-consultant-david-weeks-persu", "ruling_link_text": "Perry silent as Weeks says Rove wasn't only Perry cheerleader", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>E-mail, Dana Perino, spokeswoman, Karl Rove, March 17, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interview,  David Weeks, March 15, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Austin American-Statesman, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/from-farm-to-politics-perry-follows-in-familys-224276.html?srcTrk=RTR_95649\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"News article by Jason Embry\">\"From farm to politics,  Perry follows in family's footsteps,\"</a> Feb. 9, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Texas  Monthly,<a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/2003-03-01/feature2.php\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Karl Rove profile by S.C.
