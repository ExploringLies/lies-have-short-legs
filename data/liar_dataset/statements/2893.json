Bush&#39;s tax cuts is approaching, and the parties are working feverishly to win public support for their position. Republicans have taken a firm stance in favor of extending the tax cuts for everyone, while President Barack Obama and many congressional Democrats want to extend them only for families earning less than $250,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFollowing a Dec. 1, 2010, meeting between congressional Republican leaders and newly elected Republican governors, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who is poised to become House speaker early next year, said the Democrats were out of touch with public opinion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t know what my colleagues across the aisle didn&#39;t hear during the election -- the American people spoke pretty loudly,&quot; <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/131527-boehner-dem-leaders-undercut-talks-on-tax-compromise\" id=\"yso1\" title=\"Boehner said\">Boehner said</a>. &quot;They said stop all the looming tax hikes and to cut spending.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur friends at <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/02/5566503-first-thoughts-fighting-vs-getting-things-done\" id=\"cykb\" title=\"NBC's First Read\">NBC&#39;s First Read</a> noticed a discrepancy between Boehner&#39;s comment and national exit poll data. &quot;Actually,&quot; First Read wrote, &quot;here&rsquo;s what the public said about the Bush tax cuts, according to the exit polls last month: 40 percent said to continue ALL of the cuts, 36 percent said to continue them for families who earn less than $250,000 a year, and an additional 15 percent said to expire them for all. So a majority -- 51 percent -- backed either the Democratic position or wants all the cuts to expire.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe thought we&#39;d expand upon First Read&#39;s research and look at additional polls. We found four taken since the election that address the question of what to do with the expiring Bush tax cuts. (We&#39;re keeping the focus narrow by not addressing the question of whether the American people support spending cuts; we found a wide variety of different questions on that issue in these polls, making it a harder question to gauge.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere are the questions on the Bush tax cuts in each survey:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/144989/Vast-Majority-Wants-Aspect-Bush-Tax-Cuts-Extended.aspx\" id=\"ubh9\" title=\"USA Today/Gallup poll\">USA Today/Gallup poll</a>, Nov. 19-21, 2010</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>What do you think Congress should do about the income tax cuts passed under George W.

But Boehner said Americans want to &quot;stop <i>all </i>the looming tax hikes,&quot; and the polls don&#39;t support such a sweeping claim.<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\" />\r\n\t<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\" />\r\n\tThe percentage of people who favor extending the tax cuts for every income level -- which is the formulation Boehner used in his comment -- ranges from 23 percent to 40 percent. That is quite a bit short of a majority.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore important for our analysis, in the three of these polls that asked the question the same way, Boehner&#39;s position didn&#39;t even achieve a plurality from poll respondents. Instead, the highest level of support for any specific course of action was actually the Obama position -- extending tax cuts for those below $250,000 and not for those above that line. Support for this position ranged from 39 percent to 50 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen pollsters widened the range of policy options, the pattern broke down somewhat. In the <em>USA Today</em>/Gallup poll, for instance, a significant minority of those who favored an income cutoff for the tax cut extension wanted that cutoff to be higher than Obama&#39;s preferred $250,000. And when NBC/<em>Wall Street Journal</em> pollsters asked about a instituting a temporary tax-cut extension for another one to three years -- a widely discussed compromise option for the White House and Congress -- it won the support of about one-quarter of poll respondents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, the general pattern we see in these polls is that Americans are more likely to side with the Obama position than with the Republican position, though neither view won a clear majority.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we contacted Boehner&#39;s office, a spokesman said that the poll results were shaped by the wording. &quot;The question should be, &#39;Do you think taxes should go up on January 1?&#39;&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;In the real world, if I make the same salary next year and I pay more taxes, that&rsquo;s a tax hike. If I pay less, that&rsquo;s a tax cut.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe don&#39;t doubt the results would have been more favorable to the GOP position if the wording had been changed, but we&#39;re not convinced by that argument. It is not an all or nothing choice. In fact, it&#39;s a choice between Democrats who propose letting the tax cuts expire for those earning more than $250,000, and Republicans who want to extend the cuts for everyone. The wording in the polls seems like a perfectly accurate reflection of those options.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we find that Boehner is wrong to claim the public supports his position. The polls show that while many Americans oppose an across-the-board expiration of the Bush tax cuts, it is not accurate to say the public spoke &quot;pretty loudly&quot; that Congress should &quot;stop all the looming tax hikes.&quot; A plurality of the &quot;American people&quot; actually support what amounts to a tax <i>hike </i>for the wealthiest Americans. So we rate Boehner&#39;s comment False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-02T15:47:36.827632", "ruling_date": "2010-12-02T16:46:29", "ruling_headline": "John Boehner says \"the American people spoke pretty loudly.
