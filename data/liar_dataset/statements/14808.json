Responding to Wisconsin Eye TV host Steven Walters, Hintz said an alternative would have to be developed first. Then he made a statement that seemed to indict the facility, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We have a 66 percent recidivism rate for the kids there, in the three years after they get out. States like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, 66 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates commit new offenses within three years of being released?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s eight times higher than in states such as Missouri, which has been held up as a <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2016/12/18/facing-problems-missouri-revamped-juvenile-justice/95395960/\">potential model for Wisconsin</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll see that, as national experts have stated, <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/QA/Detail.aspx?Id=113&amp;context=9\">comparing states</a> on juvenile recidivism is <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/data-visualizations/interactives/2014/measuring-juvenile-recidivism/docs/juvenile_recidivism_data_table.pdf?la=en\">not easily done</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The trouble at Lincoln Hills</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2016/12/17/crisis-lincoln-hills-juvenile-prison-years-making/95383518/\">Lincoln Hills</a> generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, with most inmates in their mid-to late-teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles. Incarcerating an inmate there costs more than $100,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Groups such as Youth Justice Milwaukee, which is <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2017/11/16/youth-advocates-push-close-wisconsin-youth-prisons-call-judges-stop-sending-teens-lincoln-hills/869777001/\">calling for</a> Wisconsin&rsquo;s youth prisons to be closed, <a href=\"https://www.youthjusticemke.org/2017/01/20/statement-youth-justice-milwaukee-courts-decision-move-teen-lincoln-hills-adult-criminal-justice-system/\">argue that conditions</a> at Lincoln Hills can lead to higher recidivism -- inmates committing new offenses after they&rsquo;re released. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has gone even further than Hintz, saying <a href=\"http://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/milwaukee-city-county-officials-partner-up-to-crack-down-on-juvenile-recidivism\">75 percent</a> of Lincoln Hills inmates fall back into criminal activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Missouri -- when facing problems similar to those at Lincoln Hills, such as fights between inmates, long stints in solitary confinement and injuries inflicted by guards -- replaced large institutions with small facilities, closer to young offenders&#39; homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the contrast in recidivism between the two states is not how Hintz portrays it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hintz&rsquo;s partially accurate evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Hintz&rsquo;s claim, his office cited a <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2017/0055_juvenile_justice_and_youth_aids_program_informational_paper_55.pdf\">January 2017 report</a> by the nonpartisan Wisconsin &nbsp;Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It says that according to the latest available data, Lincoln Hills has a three-year recidivism rate of 63 percent. That is, 278 juveniles were released from Lincoln Hills in 2011 and 63 percent returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, by 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Hintz&rsquo;s claim of a 66 percent recidivism rate at Lincoln Hills is high by only three percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/re/pdf/dys/youth-services-annual-report-fy16.pdf\">Missouri&rsquo;s definition</a> of recidivism is roughly similar to <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2017/0055_juvenile_justice_and_youth_aids_program_informational_paper_55.pdf\">Wisconsin&rsquo;s</a>, but has four parts. It includes youths who are sent back to the juvenile system, are sent to adult prison, are put on probation, or are put into a 120-day program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the latest State of Missouri figures show Missouri&rsquo;s three-year recidivism rate, for 2013 to 2016, is <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/re/pdf/dys/youth-services-annual-report-fy16.pdf\">30 percent</a>. That&rsquo;s far less than Lincoln Hills&rsquo; 63 percent. But it&rsquo;s also much higher than the 8 percent Hintz claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That lower rate applies only to the first part of Missouri&rsquo;s recidivism definition -- youths who commit new offenses and are sent back to the youth system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Apples and oranges</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also other problems with comparing Lincoln Hills to Missouri:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Lincoln Hills</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Missouri</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Latest three-year recidivism rate is 2011-2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Latest recidivism rate is 2013-2016</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Only male inmates</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Male and female offenders</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Inmates have committed <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/investigations/2016/12/17/crisis-lincoln-hills-juvenile-prison-years-making/95383518/\">serious, violent crimes</a> &nbsp;&mdash; including homicide and robbery &mdash; or have had repeated run-ins with the law and didn&rsquo;t turn their behavior around after being sent to group homes.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Youths have committed a <a href=\"https://dss.mo.gov/re/pdf/dys/youth-services-annual-report-fy16.pdf\">wide variety of offenses</a>, from serious felonies to truancy and curfew violations.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Those create a major apples-to-oranges problem for Hintz&rsquo;s statement, particularly the fact Missouri&rsquo;s count includes many less serious offenders than Lincoln Hills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hintz says Wisconsin&#39;s Lincoln Hills youth prison has a &quot;66 percent recidivism rate,&quot; while &quot;states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is essentially correct on Wisconsin. The latest figures show that 63 percent of Lincoln Hills offenders are returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, within three years of being released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the comparison to Missouri misses on several counts. Missouri reports a three-year youth recidivism rate of 30 percent, not 8 percent -- and even that is misleading. While Lincoln Hills incarcerates only serious male offenders, Missouri&rsquo;s youth correctional system includes males and females who commit offenses ranging from serious crimes to truancy. So, Hintz is comparing two significantly different populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hintz&rsquo;s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Related fact checks</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Judge James Peterson: We&rsquo;ve rated a claim that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, &quot;has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills.&quot;<strong> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/17/james-peterson/district-judge-ted-kaczynski-has-less-restrictive-/\">Mostly True</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Police Chief <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/edward-flynn/\">Edward Flynn</a>: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft &quot;get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court&quot; on holding suspects, &quot;a stolen car gets zero points.&quot; <strong><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/19/edward-flynn/juvenile-car-theft-suspects-milwaukee-county-get-s/\">Mostly False</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/leah-vukmir/\">Leah Vukmir</a> (R-Brookfield), a 2018 candidate for U.S. Senate: In 2016, there were 5,570 people in Wisconsin &quot;who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked.&quot; <strong><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/20/leah-vukmir/wisconsin-thousands-probation-commit-new-crimes-do/\">Half True</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Judge <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/james-peterson/\">James Peterson</a>: &quot;Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills.&quot; <strong><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/17/james-peterson/district-judge-ted-kaczynski-has-less-restrictive-/\">Mostly True</a></strong>.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-04T15:01:51.495567", "ruling_date": "2017-12-06T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Recidivism rate at Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison for males is 66%, Missouri's is only 8%?", "ruling_headline_slug": "recidivism-rate-wisconsins-lincoln-hills-youth-pri", "ruling_link_text": "Apples-oranges comparison; Missouri rate not 8%", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Eye, <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Video-Archive/Event-Detail/evhdid/11996\">Robin Vos-Gordon Hintz interview</a> (20:00), Nov. 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Rep.
