He seems to think if he gives terrorists the rights of Americans, lets them lawyer up and reads them their Miranda rights, we won&rsquo;t be at war. He seems to think if we bring the mastermind of Sept. 11 to New York, give him a lawyer and trial in civilian court, we won&rsquo;t be at war.  <br /> <br /> \"He seems to think if he closes Guantanamo and releases the hard-core al-Qaida-trained terrorists still there, we won&rsquo;t be at war. He seems to think if he gets rid of the words, 'war on terror,' we won't be at war. But we are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren&rsquo;t, it makes us less safe. Why doesn&rsquo;t he want to admit we&rsquo;re at war? It doesn&rsquo;t fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn&rsquo;t fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency &mdash; social transformation &mdash; the restructuring of American society. President Obama&rsquo;s first object and his highest responsibility must be to defend us against an enemy that knows we are at war.\"</p>\r\n<p>Cheney's comments echo a frequent criticism by conservatives that President Obama does not use the phrase \"war on terror.\" We rated that True when it was  <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/11/sean-hannity/hannity-says-obama-wont-even-use-term-war-terroris/\" target=\"_blank\"> made by talk show host Sean Hannity </a> in November 2009. We noted in our ruling that Obama had said he didn't use the more general phrase \"war on terror\" because he viewed the conflict as a war against \"some terrorist organizations.\"</p>\r\n<p>With his statement to  <em> </em>Politico<em></em>, Cheney is going further than Hannity did, directly alleging that Obama will not \"admit we're at war.\"</p>\r\n<p>But a review of Obama's statements of the past year makes it clear he has often said the United States is at war against terrorist organizations.</p>\r\n<p><strong> The fifth paragraph of his inaugural address </strong> : \"Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong> In a February 2009 CNN interview: </strong> \"I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations.\"</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"text\"> <strong> In a March 2009 speech: </strong> He said that people might ask why the United States is </span> <span class=\"text\"> at war and said, \"Al-Qaida and its allies, the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks, are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al-Qaida is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><strong> In his December 2009 speech at West Point on his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan: </strong> He repeatedly called it a war and said, \"  <span class=\"text\"> I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al-Qaida.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><strong> In his speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize: </strong> He said that \"we are at war\" and noted that  <span class=\"text\"> \"the world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks, and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense.\" </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"text\"> Cheney has offered lots of criticism of Obama in the past year (of the claims we've rated, Cheney has earned a   <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/23/dick-cheney/cheney-accuses-obama-telling-allies-canceled-proje/\" target=\"_blank\"> True </a> and a   <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/22/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-claims-blair-said-high-value-informati/\" target=\"_blank\"> Mostly True </a> ). His remarks here go beyond opinion because he repeatedly says that Obama won't acknowledge that the United States is at war. But even a cursory examination of Obama's statements shows this one is preposterous. Obama has often said the United States is at war against terrorist organizations -- and has ordered a massive increase in U.S. troops in Afghanistan to fight that war. So Cheney's comment isn't just False, it's ridiculously so.
