Bush, and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat, Bill Clinton,\" Obama said.  \"Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench, and more  varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United  States Supreme Court had when they were appointed.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Listening to that quote, you might think Sotomayor was way ahead of the other justices when they were nominated. But after our review of the current justices, we find that Sotomayor has roughly the same experience they had.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nevertheless, Obama's statement is technically accurate. Here's why:\n</p>\n<p>\n It appears Obama is only counting legal experience obtained on the federal district courts or courts of appeal. It may surprise you to know that a judge need not sit on the district court level before being named to the higher appellate court. Compared with the sitting Supreme Court justices, Sotomayor is the only one to have experience on both the district court level\n <em>\n  and\n </em>\n the appellate level. Hence Obama's claim that she has \"more varied\" experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n But drill down into the numbers, and Sotomayor has more total federal court experience only by a single year, and two justices have more appellate experience than she does.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sotomayor served six years on the district court level and 11 years on the appellate level for a grand total of 17 years. Contrast this with Samuel Alito, who sat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for 16 years, or Stephen Breyer, who sat on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals for 14 years, with four of those as the chief judge. If you consider Sotomayor more experienced than these justices, it's only by a margin of a year or two. And constitutional lawyers (or the judges' moms) might argue that Alito and Breyer's additional appellate experience is more relevant than experience at the district court level.\n</p>\n<p>\n If we take a broader view of experience than only federal court service, Sotomayor is about the same as most of her would-be fellow justices. (We have compiled a detailed chart on the professional experience of Sotomayor and the Supreme Court justices and have included it at the end of this article.)\n</p>\n<p>\n This year, Sotomayor will have graduated from law school 30 years ago, with a full legal career under her belt. This is very close to the average number of years of experience we calculated for other justices at the time they were nominated. We calculated the average working experience of the current justices &mdash; omitting David Souter, whom Sotomayor may replace &mdash; and found that the average professional career prior to Supreme Court appointment was 28.7 years. By our count, four justices have slightly more years than Sotomayor in their legal careers: John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Chief Justice John Roberts and Alito.\n</p>\n<p>\n To be clear, people could argue a lot over what kind of legal experience is more relevant or important to serving on the Supreme Court. Our analysis is based on years of service, and doesn't reflect the quality of the work of any of the justices.\n</p>\n<p>\n Listening to what Obama said, though &mdash; \"Walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed\" &mdash; you might conclude that Sotomayor is more qualified than previous nominees to be a Supreme Court Justice. In fact, her legal career and years of experience are in line with the other justices.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama's statement is technically accurate, but also implies she's more qualified. We don't find that to be the case. We rate Obama's statement Half True.\n</p>\n<p>\n <em>\n  Editor's note: For brevity, we've omitted some details of their experience, such as additional educational credentials or service on some boards and commissions.\n </em>\n <br />\n <br />\n <strong>\n  John Paul Stevens\n </strong>\n <br />\n Took seat on court: Dec.  19, 1975, at age 55\n <br />\n Appellate court: 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 1970-1975\n <br />\n Private practice: partner, Rothschild, Stevens, Barry &amp; Myers, 1952-1970; associate, Poppenhusen, Johnston, Thompson &amp; Raymond, 1949-1952\n <br />\n Teaching: Lecturer, antitrust law, Northwestern University School of Law, 1953-54; University of Chicago Law School, 1955-58\n <br />\n Federal government experience: associate counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Study of Monopoly Power, 1951&ndash;1952; member of the Attorney General&rsquo;s National Committee to Study Antitrust Law, 1953&ndash;1955\n <br />\n Other experience: U.S. Navy, 1942-1945; clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge, 1947\n <br />\n Degrees: AB from the University of Chicago, 1941; JD from Northwestern University School of Law. 1947\n <br />\n <strong>\n  Total federal court experience: 5 years\n  <br />\n  PolitiFact's estimate of relevant experience: 33 years\n </strong>\n <br />\n <br />\n <strong>\n  Antonin Scalia\n </strong>\n <br />\n Took seat on court: Sept. 26, 1986, at age 50\n <br />\n Appellate court: U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, 1982-1986\n <br />\n Private practice: associate, Jones Day Cockley &amp; Reavis, 1961-1967\n <br />\n Teaching: professor, University of Chicago Law School, 1977-1982; professor, University of Virginia Law School, 1967-1974\n <br />\n Federal government experience: general counsel, Office of Telecommunications Policy, 1971&ndash;1972; chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States from 1972&ndash;1974; assistant attorney general, Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Justice Department, 1974-1977\n <br />\n Degrees: AB, Georgetown University, 1957; LLB, Harvard University, 1960\n <br />\n <strong>\n  Total federal court experience: 4 years\n  <br />\n  PolitiFact's estimate of relevant experience: 26 years\n </strong>\n <br />\n <br />\n <strong>\n  Anthony Kennedy\n </strong>\n <br />\n Took seat on court: Feb. 18, 1988 at age 51\n <br />\n Appellate court: 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 1975-1988\n <br />\n Private practice: attorney, 1961-1967; partner, Evans, Jackson &amp; Kennedy, 1967-1975\n <br />\n Teaching: professor, McGeorge School of Law, University of the Pacific, 1965-1988\n <br />\n Other experience: California Army National Guard, 1961\n <br />\n Degrees: AB, Stanford, 1958; LLB, Harvard, 1961\n <br />\n <strong>\n  Total federal court experience: 13 years\n  <br />\n  PolitiFact's estimate of relevant experience: 27 years\n </strong>\n <br />\n <br />\n <strong>\n  Clarence Thomas\n </strong>\n <br />\n Took seat on court: Oct. 23, 1991 at age 43\n <br />\n Appellate court: U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, District of Columbia, 1990-1991\n <br />\n Private practice: attorney with the Monsanto Company, 1977-1979\n <br />\n State government experience: assistant attorney general of Missouri, 1974-1977\n <br />\n Federal government experience: legislative assistant to U.S. Sen.
