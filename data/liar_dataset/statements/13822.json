The latest figure reported under that method: 92 percent, in 2011-12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second method, which is newer and more accurate, tracks detailed student-level data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That method dates to 2009-10 in Wisconsin. It shows a rising rate from 85.7 percent in Evers&rsquo; first year up to 88.4 percent in 2014-15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So neither approach backs up Evers&rsquo; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, the state&rsquo;s rate of 88.4 percent for on-time graduation (four years) ranked 6th-highest nationally by the latest numbers, which is actually a drop from No. 2 four years earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Behind the claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where do the numbers cited by the Evers campaign come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers look at how many students from a 9th-grade class graduate over five or six years, not four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin began tracking so-called <a href=\"https://dpi.wi.gov/graduation/extended-calucations\">&quot;extended-year graduation&quot;</a> in Evers&rsquo; first year; dozens of other states also collect it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewed this way, Evers campaign says, the class of 2009-10 four-year graduation rate for the class of 2009-10 was 85.7 percent. It rose to 89.5 percent after five years and to 90.4 percent after six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar growth pattern appears in later years, when you track an individual class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we can&rsquo;t judge if the same thing was happening before Evers, because the collection of the extended-year graduation rate didn&rsquo;t start until his second year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we can&rsquo;t fully evaluate whether these figures show that &quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent&quot; since he took over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, even if they did, it would apply to the less-used &quot;extended-year rate,&quot; not the more conventional 4-year rate that is better known to the average person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers claimed on Facebook: &quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s graduation rates have grown to over 90%&quot; since he became state school superintendent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the traditional measure -- graduation in four years -- Wisconsin&rsquo;s rate is one of the best in America, but still below 90 percent using one approach. Using the other, it topped that mark before Evers even took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the extended-year graduation rate provides an element of truth to the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That puts it at &nbsp;Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-06T16:20:24.148756", "ruling_date": "2017-03-10T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tony Evers says graduation rates surpass 90 percent.
