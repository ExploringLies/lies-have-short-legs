Mitch McConnell was peppered with questions about his opposition to a proposed minimum wage hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response, McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, said raising the minimum wage in already difficult economic times would hurt employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cited a Congressional Budget Office study that he claimed said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would &quot;destroy half a million to 1 million jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s not the way to grow our economy,&quot; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His Democratic challenger, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, countered that the report also noted a minimum wage hike would lift, &quot;over a million Americans out of poverty.&quot; (In a separate fact-check, we rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/14/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-raising-minimum-wage-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re taking a look at McConnell&rsquo;s claim in this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report in question from the Congressional Budget Office, the chief fiscal scorekeeper for Congress, came out in February 2014. It took a look at President Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposal to raise the minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report found most low-wage workers &quot;would received higher pay that would increase their family&rsquo;s income.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the report said there&rsquo;s a downside as well. Some people could lose their jobs. Why? An increase in wages would increase companies&rsquo; costs. That causes companies to raise their prices, which means fewer people want their goods or services, leading to less production and fewer workers needed to get the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers also encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing more productive higher-wage workers. For example, it might be cheaper to pay more for new machines that can replace workers, than to pay higher minimum wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The net impact of this? The CBO estimates a total reduction in the workforce of about 0.3 percent, or 500,000 workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How, then, did McConnell get between &quot;half a million and 1 million jobs&quot; would be destroyed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CBO is very careful to note that 500,000 is a rough estimate and the midpoint of the range of likely outcomes. The report said, &quot;There is about a two-thirds chance that the effect would be in the range between a very slight reduction in employment and a reduction in employment of 1 million workers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of quoting the halfway point or &mdash; most accurately &mdash; offering the full-range of estimates, McConnell presents the top half of likely outcomes as though it&rsquo;s fact. It&rsquo;s just as likely that there are somewhere between very few and 499,999 jobs lost, but you would not get that impression from McConnell&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell claimed that a Congressional Budget Office report said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour &quot;will destroy between half a million and one million jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report said &quot;roughly&quot; 500,000 workers could lose their jobs if the minimum wage went up. But the CBO added that most likely the range was between very few to 1 million. McConnell focuses on the high-end of the spectrum on a range of potential outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-14T16:26:01.507959", "ruling_date": "2014-10-14T17:35:14", "ruling_headline": "Mitch McConnell says minimum wage hike would 'destroy' 500,000 to 1 million jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitch-mcconnell-says-minimum-wage-hike-would-destr", "ruling_link_text": "Singles out high end of estimated outcomes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>C-SPAN,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?321958-1/kentucky-senate-debate\" style=\"margin: 0px;
