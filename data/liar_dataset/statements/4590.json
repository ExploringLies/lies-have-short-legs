Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in Texas, the home state of a rival, Gov. Rick Perry. One of the yardsticks he used was how many children are uninsured in each state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured&quot; in Massachusetts, said Romney, who signed a law designed to get uninsured residents covered. &quot;You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check Romney&rsquo;s math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the <a href=\"http://statehealthfacts.org/\">statehealthfacts.org</a> website, assembled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent research organization specializing in health care policy. The most recent state-by-state figures available are for the period 2008-09.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor <a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?cat=3&amp;sub=39&amp;rgn=23\">Massachusetts</a>, there were 51,400 uninsured children (that is, birth to 18), or 3 percent. (Of those with insurance, 65 percent got it from an employer and 29 percent got it from Medicaid.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis means that Romney&rsquo;s number is overly rosy -- he said less than 1 percent, when the percentage is actually three times higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be fair, Massachusetts still had the <a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?ind=127&amp;cat=3\">lowest percentage of uninsured children in the nation</a>. And it did a whole lot better than Texas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?cat=3&amp;sub=39&amp;rgn=45\">Texas</a> had 1,303,000 children without insurance over the same period, or 18 percent. (Of those with insurance, 42 percent got it from an employer, 35 percent got it from Medicaid, 3 percent from an individually purchased plan, and 2 percent from other public plans.) Texas&#39; rate is the highest in the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo for Texas, Romney was accurate. He even undercounted a bit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign pointed to a <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/dhcfp/r/pubs/10/mhis_report_12-2010.pdf\">report</a> published by the Massachusetts state government that found that &quot;virtually all Massachusetts children had health insurance coverage in 2010 (99.8 percent). The uninsured rate for Massachusetts children fell from 1.9 percent in 2009 to 0.2 percent in 2010.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, the report did not address uninsured children in Texas, and we prefer to compare states using a study with equivalent methodologies if one is available, and in this case, we&rsquo;re sticking with the Kaiser report&rsquo;s numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney said that &quot;less than 1 percent&quot; of Massachusetts kids are uninsured, when in fact the best available number is 3 percent. But that&rsquo;s still the lowest in the nation. Meanwhile, he actually underestimated the number of uninsured children in Texas when he said there were a million. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-12T13:39:58.476715", "ruling_date": "2011-10-12T14:44:43", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney raps number of uninsured kids in Texas, touts statistics for Massachusetts", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-raps-number-uninsured-kids-texas-touts", "ruling_link_text": "Romney's numbers are close", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTranscript of Republican presidential debate at Hanover, N.H., Oct. 11, 2011 (accessed via CQ, subscribers only)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation&#39;s statehealthfacts.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?cat=3&amp;sub=39&amp;rgn=23\">Massachusetts Health Insurance Status, Health Insurance Coverage of Children 0-18</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation&#39;s statehealthfacts.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?cat=3&amp;sub=39&amp;rgn=45\">Texas Health Insurance Status, Health Insurance Coverage of Children 0-18</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation&#39;s statehealthfacts.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?ind=127&amp;cat=3\">Health Insurance Coverage of Children 0-18, national rankings</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/data/children/uninsured/liuc10.xls\">Low Income Uninsured Children By State</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 11, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMassachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/dhcfp/r/pubs/10/mhis_report_12-2010.pdf\">Health Insurance Coverage in Massachusetts: Results from the 2008-2010 Massachusetts Health Insurance Surveys</a>,&quot; December 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tMassachusetts has &quot;less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured.
