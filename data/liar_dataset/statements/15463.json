But as impressive as some of these statistics may be, I think it is important to keep in mind that these stories are, at the end of the day, human stories. More than 1 million new jobs have been created just since we passed tax reform last December.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When McConnell&rsquo;s office <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;amp=&amp;v=FsQ1p35bQ8I\">posted the speech to YouTube</a>, it hit the jobs line hard, giving it the title, &quot;More Than One Million Jobs Created Since the Passage of Republican Tax Reform.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s little question that the economy, and particularly the jobs picture, are strong. The 3.8 percent unemployment rate is the lowest since 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about McConnell&#39;s floor speech, his office offered another quote from the Majority Leader: &quot;I spoke yesterday about the new job opportunities flooding into the U.S. economy. It&rsquo;s all thanks to the ingenuity of American workers and job-creators, with an assist from Republican policies. &hellip; Republicans are proud of the historic tax reform and dramatic regulatory reform that helped make this happen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is there evidence that Republican policies have boosted job creation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s always tricky to isolate whether specific policies have shaped economic trends, policies implemented by the Republicans in charge of the White House and Congress probably had some effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the number of new jobs gained since passage of the Republican-backed tax bill in December 2017 is pretty similar in scale to those racked up by both President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump going back to 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell is correct on the number. From January to May 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a net increase of 1.037 million jobs. That works out to about 207,000 more net jobs a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But rather than being a turnaround from weak to strong, that amount of job creation is roughly in line with the gains in each of the past nine years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart showing the month-to-month job gains since the start of 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>And here&rsquo;s a chart showing the job gains for every January-to-May period in recent years. Since 2010 &mdash; the year the Great Recession began to wane and the recovery began &mdash; every January-to-May period saw an average monthly job gain of between 160,000 and 236,000. The performance for 2018 was slightly higher than the average, but pretty typical.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, came to a similar conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He looked at all 96 overlapping five-month periods from May 2010 to April 2018 to see how many of those five-month periods saw job creation grow at a faster rate than the first five months of this year. He found that employment increased faster than the most recent five-month period 47 percent of the time, and slower 53 percent of the time. In other words, the past five months were pretty ordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, job growth since December 2017 does not look exceptional compared with job growth throughout the current economic expansion,&quot; Burtless said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burtless said he didn&rsquo;t doubt that the changes to the tax code could have had an effect on job creation. But he said it&rsquo;s hard to measure how much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the absence of the tax cut, job growth might have been weaker than what we actually saw,&quot; he said. &quot;My guess is that the tax cut probably boosted employment growth at least a bit. It&rsquo;s just too soon to be sure, and we&rsquo;ll probably never know with very much confidence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, he added, &quot;it is not very convincing to claim recent job growth has been particularly remarkable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell said, &quot;The bottom line is clear: Under the policies of this unified Republican government, American workers, families, and business owners are achieving economic growth that is unmatched in recent memory. &hellip; More than 1 million new jobs have been created just since we passed tax reform last December.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officially, it&rsquo;s 1,037,000 new jobs &mdash; and it&rsquo;s likely that the tax cut had some positive impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s questionable to suggest that job growth in the past five months has been especially strong, or that recent rates of job-creation represent some kind of turnaround from a poor performance earlier. Job growth in the past five months is in line with the gains seen in previous five-month periods and in previous January-to-May periods going back nine years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Correction</strong>: The original version of this fact-check misstated the last year the national unemployment rate was 3.8 percent.
