The subject line was &quot;Something worth forwarding.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n Axelrod began his e-mail with a list of ways that reform provides &quot;security and stability to those with or without coverage.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n One of his claims is that refom &quot;ends exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays: Insurance companies will have to abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\n We recognize that &quot;exorbitant&quot; is subjective, but we thought it would be helpful to research whether Axelrod is right that the plan limits charges that a typical person or family would find excessive.\n</p>\n<p>\n The main health care reform bill in Congress does set annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses. That means there's a cap on what people would have to pay in a year for medical costs. And insurance companies won't be allowed to require patients to pay for preventive treatments such as check-ups.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the House legislation, outlined in section 122, the annual cap on out-of-pocket expenses is $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. Those numbers are indexed for inflation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The policy would be phased in. Employer-provided policies would have a grace period of five years, as outlined in section 102, before they are required to comply with the caps. If you get a new individual policy through the health care exchange, it would have to comply right away.\n</p>\n<p>\n We asked Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund about the caps. The Commonwealth Fund is a nonpartisan private foundation that advocates for a better health care system. She said the caps are a good form of consumer protection.\n</p>\n<p>\n Axelrod is correct that the main health care reform bill requires insurance companies to &quot;abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses.&quot; But ending &quot;exorbitant&quot; out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays? 'Exorbitant' may be in the eye of the beholder. For a family, $10,000 in the course of a year can be a serious financial hit. (The median income for a family of four is $67,000.) Still, the new limits are better than nothing, and health care advocates praise them as an important safeguard for consumers. So we rate Axelrod's statement Mostly True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:42.780174", "ruling_date": "2009-08-14T18:27:34", "ruling_headline": "Reform plan caps out-of-pocket expenses", "ruling_headline_slug": "reform-plan-caps-out-pocket-expenses", "ruling_link_text": "$10k per year per family", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n U.S. Government Printing Office,\n <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3200ih.txt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n  HR 3200\n </a>\n (health care reform legislation), July 14, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Speaker of the House Web site,\n <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/111/sbys3200.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Section-by-Section Analysis of HR 3200\n </a>\n , July 14, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,\n <a href=\"http://help.senate.gov/BAI09A84_xml.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Health care reform bill draft\n </a>\n , accessed Aug. 13, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview with Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Census,\n <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/4person.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Median Income for 4-Person Families, by State\n </a>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "", "id": 209, "last_name": "Axelrod", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "david-axelrod", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Axelrod.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/209/", "total_count": 18, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Obama's plan for health care reform &quot;ends exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a chain e-mail", "statement_date": "2009-08-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
