Gene Green, D-Houston, recently urged colleagues to move quickly because Congress had &quot;only three days left until student loan interest rates double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat statement, from a June 28, 2013, <a href=\"http://green.house.gov/press-release/rep-green-statement-student-loan-interest-rate-doubling\">press release</a>, matches recent declarations from other politicians; in fact, we had already started checking a version from President Barack Obama when we received Green&rsquo;s release by email. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGreen&rsquo;s statement further describes the loans as Stafford loans. A spokeswoman for Green, Veronica Custer, emailed us details including a June 18, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=d7937b2f-e01c-4721-8b8b-09f5776725a1\">report</a> from the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee (Congress&rsquo; economic advisory committee) that said, &quot;Unless Congress acts, the interest rate on subsidized federal Stafford loans is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHalf of the nation&rsquo;s roughly 21 million college students get some form of federal aid, <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/\">according</a> to the government&rsquo;s National Center for Education Statistics. Much of that comes in the form of federal student loans, guaranteed by the government and with low interest rates set by Congress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd about 80 percent of federal student loans are <a href=\"http://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/4370\">Stafford loans</a>, according to a June 13, 2013, <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-student-loan-rate-hike/\">news story</a>. Named in memory of a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/us/24stafford.html\">U.S. senator</a> from Vermont who championed education measures, Staffords are either subsidized, meaning the government pays part of the interest, or unsubsidized, meaning the student pays all the interest.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized\">Subsidized</a> Stafford loans are available to undergraduates who show financial need; according to the <em>Post </em>story, they make up about a quarter of federal student loans. The unsubsidized variety doesn&rsquo;t require proof of financial need and is open to graduate students as well as undergrads; about half of all federal student loans are of this type, the <em>Post </em>said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAbout 7 million students are expected to take out subsidized Stafford loans after June 2013 -- and they&rsquo;ll get the 6.8 percent rate unless Congress acts as it did at a similar juncture in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTom Melecki, director of the Office of Financial Services at the University of Texas, described via email the effect of such a rate on a subsidized Stafford loan: &quot;If an undergraduate were to borrow the $23,000 maximum &ndash; something which is increasingly common -- he or she would repay $31,761.60 over 10 years at a 6.8 percent interest rate, but $27,163.20 at a 3.4 percent interest rate. So this student would save $4,598.40 in interest payments at the lower rate.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe government pays billions to keep its interest rates on federal loans low. According to the Department of Education&rsquo;s student aid <a href=\"http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/interest-rates\">website</a>, rates range from 5 percent to 7.8 percent on non-Stafford types of federal loans taken out from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnsubsidized Stafford loans in the same timeframe have an interest rate of 6.8 percent and aren&rsquo;t scheduled to change, so subsidized Staffords will match the unsubsidized kind if their rate reverts July 1, 2013. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a 2007 overhaul of the federal student loan system, Congress passed <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.2669:\">a temporary act</a> reducing the rate on new subsidized Stafford loans gradually from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, set to expire July 1, 2012, according to a Sept. 8, 2007, <em>Los Angeles Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.sunjournal.com/node/113246\">news story</a> and a Sept. 28, 2007, <em>Washington Post </em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/27/AR2007092700958.html\">news story</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut lawmakers swooped in June 29, 2012, to postpone the rate hike until July 1, 2013, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe revised deadline looms amid competing claims about how the issue might be resolved.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA June 26, 2013,<em> New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/education/deadline-near-with-no-deal-on-loan-rates-for-students.html\">news story</a> said plans had been offered by President Barack Obama as well as Republican, Democratic and bipartisan combinations of Congress members. Green&rsquo;s press release said he supported a measure that would freeze the 3.4 percent interest rate for two years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut with time running out and no agreement on the horizon, the <em>Times </em>said, it appeared likely that a measure addressing the rate would have to be applied retroactively to loans taken out after July 1.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p d=\"\">\r\n\tGreen said &quot;student loan interest rates&quot; would double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat accurately describes one specific rate change.
