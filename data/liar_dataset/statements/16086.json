Claire McCaskill and Attorney General Josh Hawley have traded allegations of being cozy with dark money &mdash; political money with an unknown source &mdash; during their Senate contest.

A corporation, the justices held, may simply spend funds from its own accounts.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The Citizens United Political Victory Fund has donated $10,000 to Hawley&rsquo;s Senate campaign (two $5,000 donations), per its website and FEC data.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, wrote an op-ed favoring Hawley&rsquo;s 2016 attorney general bid in USA Today entitled &quot;Josh Hawley for Attorney General.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;I was proud to be an early supporter of Josh Hawley for Attorney General and will support him again in his race for the Senate,&quot; Bossie wrote in a Fox News story published Oct. 23, 2017. The story detailed his support for a variety of conservative Senate candidates. Bossie was adamant that he hoped Hawley, someone he sees as outside the Republican establishment, would triumph over McCaskill, and he was particularly impressed with Hawley&rsquo;s &quot;fine work fighting for religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case at the U.S. Supreme Court.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hawley campaign spokeswoman Kelli Ford pointed out that McCaskill has benefitted from the dark money that she decried.
