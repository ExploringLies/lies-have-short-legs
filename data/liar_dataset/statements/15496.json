(In 2018, the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/\">poverty level</a> is $12,140 for individuals and $25,100 for a family of four.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that full expansion, Wisconsin would have gained enough additional federal funding that it would be spending an estimated $1.07 billion less in state money on Medicaid, over roughly a five-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimate is through the current, 2017-&rsquo;19 state budget cycle, and assumes the state had done the full expansion when it could have in April 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In responding to Wachs&rsquo; claim, Walker&rsquo;s campaign did not challenge the $1 billion figure, but offered a statement that said in part:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Taking the Medicaid funding under Obamacare would require the state to expand eligibility for Medicaid beyond those living in poverty. The people pushing for Wisconsin to take the Medicaid expansion are really advocating for putting more able-bodied, working-age adults onto a new form of welfare.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker has also argued in rejecting the full expansion that because of persistent U.S. budget deficits, the federal government eventually would reduce the money available for the expansion, putting a financial burden on states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Partial expansion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to point out that Walker did do what is called a &quot;partial expansion&quot; of Medicaid. As a result of that change, for the first time in state history, essentially everyone living in Wisconsin at the federal poverty level <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-covered-everyone-poverty-medi/\">is eligible for&nbsp;Medicaid</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, in Wisconsin, you&rsquo;re eligible for Medicaid if your income is at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, rather than the 133 percent with the full expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s move did push Wisconsinites living slightly above the poverty level off of Medicaid. They in turn became eligible to buy, with federal subsidies, private health insurance in the Obamacare marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/politifact.wisconsin/\">Like us on Facebook</a>.
