The Peach State is solidly red -- all statewide offices are held by Republicans. And Sanders was trounced by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton (71 percent to 28 percent) in their March 1 primary here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Sanders&rsquo; supporters insist there is a larger point to be made as Clinton and Sanders get ready for the June 7 California primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact that Clinton is well positioned to get enough delegates to take the Democratic nod, Sanders is the better choice when it comes to a head-to-head matchup with presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump, according to Sanders&rsquo; Southern backers. And they took to Facebook recently to insist that a cross section of polls backs them up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could the group Georgians for Bernie Sanders for President be correct? &nbsp;Do the polls suggest Sanders would run stronger against Trump than Clinton?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact looked at a similar statement by Sanders himself earlier this year. That fact check looked at polls from January and February. We rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/08/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-consistently-beats-donald-t/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Sanders and Clinton camps for their reads on the more recent polls. Clinton&rsquo;s campaign did not respond. Clinton has previously said she will win the nomination and is focusing on Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren Gunnels of the Sanders campaign provided a series of polls from Real Clear Politics that shows Sanders leading Trump by more than 10 points. Another &nbsp;group of polls shows Trump and Clinton neck-and-neck. Most of the polls were conducted in mid-May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Clinton-Trump matchup, a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Trump up by 2 points. Trump leads Clinton by 6 points in a CBS News/New York Times poll, but Clinton is up by 3 points in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Trump-Sanders contest, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Sanders up by 15 points, while a CBS News/New York Times poll shows Sanders ahead by 13 points. A Fox News poll shows Sanders ahead by 3 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A May 9-12 poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Trump would best Clinton 45 percent to 41 percent in Georgia. But Sanders was favored over Trump by Georgia voters, 47 percent to 42 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sweep of the poll numbers could have an impact on the remainder of the Democratic race, said state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, a Sanders delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Fort admitted that Sanders has an &quot;uphill battle&quot; against Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It makes the argument to the superdelegates stronger,&quot; Fort said. &quot;And these polls are not outliers. It&rsquo;s a convincing argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Bernie Sanders has changed the Democratic Party forever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato added a word of caution about reading too much into the snapshots of voters&rsquo; opinions at this stage of the contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Almost all polls I&#39;ve seen since Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee show a close race between Trump and Clinton but a wider margin of victory for Sanders,&quot; Sabato said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What the polls cannot show is whether this matters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said Sanders has received relatively little vetting by the press. Sabato added that &nbsp;Republicans would like nothing better than to run against &quot;a self-proclaimed socialist.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I might have missed an ad or two, but I haven&#39;t seen a single negative TV ad run against Sanders,&quot; &nbsp;he said. &nbsp;&quot;For Clinton and Trump, being the target of negative ads is a daily hazard.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, said Sanders shows up so strongly in head-to-head polls because Trump and Clinton have such high negatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;General election polls don&rsquo;t mean much until the conventions are over and you get to late summer or early fall,&quot; Swint said. &quot;A lot of voters don&rsquo;t look at Sanders as a legitimate threat. It&rsquo;s almost like he&rsquo;s an imaginary candidate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pro-Sanders Facebook group in Georgia said polls indicate Bernie Sanders would do better than Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head battle with Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major polls support that contention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s difficult to say what the polls mean at this stage of the election cycle, when Sanders -- a relative unknown on the national stage -- is theoretically pitted against two well-known personalities, each with substantial baggage. That&rsquo;s important context when looking at the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ea583f3-d5b4-48c9-8437-fda465c0798f\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ea583f3-d5b4-48c9-8437-fda465c0798f</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-26T14:47:37.758092", "ruling_date": "2016-06-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Pro-Sanders group on target about their candidate's polling against Trump", "ruling_headline_slug": "pro-sanders-group-target-about-their-candidates-po", "ruling_link_text": "Bernie leads but are the serious folks really counting", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>May 26 telephone interview with Kerwin Swint</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 25 email from Larry Sabato</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 24 email from Warren Gunnels</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 25 telephone interview with State Sen.
