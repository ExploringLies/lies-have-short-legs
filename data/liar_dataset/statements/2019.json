(That's Table S-3 for budget nerds.) The figure for fiscal year 2009 -- the last complete fiscal year -- shows the following breakdown:<br /><br />&bull; Appropriated security programs: $782 billion<br />&bull; Mandatory programs (includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, among other programs): $2.112 trillion<br />&bull; Net interest: $187 billion<br /><br />If you add together mandatory programs and the net interest, then divide that by the amount spent on security programs, the ratio is 2.93 -- very close to the \"three times more\" that Palin cites.<br /><br />Here are some caveats. The appropriated security programs category includes the nuclear weapons portion of the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security, portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State and other international programs. Defense programs account for about 80 percent of the total, but not the entire amount.<br /><br />Meanwhile, if you total up the budget for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- the three big entitlements most familiar to Americans -- it accounts for about two-thirds of the budget for&nbsp;mandatory programs. The \"other mandatory programs\" category includes such things as veterans' benefits. <br /><br />Despite these distinctions, we think it's reasonable for Palin to describe all security programs as \"defense\" and all mandatory programs as \"entitlements.\" In all, then, we rate this comment by Palin much more favorably than we do her other comment from the same speech. This one earns a rating of True.</span></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-07T16:44:02.191080", "ruling_date": "2010-07-09T13:55:36", "ruling_headline": "Palin says U.S. spends three times more on entitlements and debt service than on defense", "ruling_headline_slug": "palin-says-us-spends-three-times-more-entitlements", "ruling_link_text": "She gets it right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sarah Palin, \"Peace Through Strength and American Pride vs. &ldquo;Enemy-Centric&rdquo; Policy\" (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/notes/sarah-palin/peace-through-strength-and-american-pride-vs-enemy-centric-policy/403777543434\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook post</a>), June 30, 2010<br /><br />Office of Management and Budget, \"Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2011\" (<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/tables.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Table S-3</a>, Baseline Projection of Current Policy by Category), July 7, 2010<br /><br />Office of Management and Budget, \"Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2011\" (<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/tables.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Table S-11</a>, Funding levels for Appropriated (\"Discretionary\") Programs by Agency), July 7, 2010<br /><br />Interview with Cindy Williams, principal research scientist in the security studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, July 7, 2010<br /><br />E-mail interview with Todd Harrison, fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, July 7, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 20, "first_name": "Sarah", "half_true_count": 9, "home_state": "Alaska", "id": 63, "last_name": "Palin", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "sarah-palin", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-sarahpalin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/63/", "total_count": 67, "true_count": 14, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\"We spend three times more on entitlements and debt services than we do on defense.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a Facebook posting", "statement_date": "2010-06-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 141, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/141/", "subject": "Social Security", "subject_slug": "social-security", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
