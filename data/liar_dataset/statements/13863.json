Delgado, associate for social concerns for the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops. She had come to the Florida House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on March 15, 2017, to testify against <a href=\"http://public.lobbytools.com/index.cfm?type=bills&amp;id=42775#summary\">HB&nbsp;83</a>, a bill sponsored by Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, that would heighten the penalties for certain violent offenses -- including sexual battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, murder, and the use of a destructive device such as a bomb -- if the defendant was in the country illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delgado said, &quot;Unlawful presence is not a crime. It is a civil violation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few minutes later, Rep. Jennifer Sullivan, R-Mount Dora, spoke in favor of the bill, saying she wanted to remind her colleagues about the legal status of the people the law targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It amazes me, honestly, that we&#39;ve even been talking about this as long as we have,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel like in the midst of this, something has gotten lost that is a crucial, main point. And that is the fact that we&#39;re talking about people who are here illegally. That means that, legally, they are breaking the law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill ultimately advanced through the subcommittee on a party-line vote, with Democrats voting against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we wanted to get to the bottom of whether undocumented immigrants were committing a crime by just being in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to legal experts, the answer is that most of the time, unlawful presence is not a crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked with the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops, Michele M. Taylor, the group&rsquo;s associate director for communications, pointed to the 2012 Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/11-182\">case</a> <em>Arizona vs. United States</em>. The <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/567/11-182/opinion3.html\">majority opinion</a> found that &quot;as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts agreed. Unlawful presence is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor, said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. It is a civil infraction that results in removal and a bar on re-entry for a certain period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not everything that&rsquo;s illegal &mdash; meaning against the law or violating the law &mdash; is a crime,&quot; Shapiro said. &quot;There are civil violations, like when you get a parking ticket. &lsquo;Unlawful presence&rsquo; is one of these. You don&#39;t go to jail or receive any other criminal punishment for being in the country illegally &mdash; you get deported.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gabriel (Jack) Chin, a professor and director of clinical legal education at the University of California-Davis law school, echoed this analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is not a crime to be present in the United States without authorization, such as by overstaying a visa,&quot; Chin said. &quot;But such a person is subject to being deported.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, it&rsquo;s also important to distinguish between &quot;unlawful presence&quot; and &quot;unlawful entry,&quot; said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Improper entry by an alien is indeed a misdemeanor, Roosevelt said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This distinction can make the use of these terms tricky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, an undocumented immigrant who entered the United States improperly would have committed a crime. However, once that person is here, the simple act of being in the United States unlawfully is not by itself a crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is a crime to cross the border other than as designated by immigration officials, but there is no separate crime for being unlawfully present in the United States,&quot; Chin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of illegal entry would be if an individual is found in the United States after previously having been deported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unlawful re-entry after a deportation order can be a federal crime, depending on circumstances,&quot; Taylor said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, said that while illegal presence is not a crime, it&rsquo;s easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they aren&rsquo;t eligible to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delgado of the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops said, &quot;Unlawful presence (in the United States) is not a crime.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is generally accurate that the simple act of being in the United States illegally is not, by itself, a crime. Rather, it&rsquo;s a civil violation that puts the individual at risk for deportation, but not for criminal prosecution. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that someone who is unlawfully present might still have committed a related crime by entering the United States after having been deported, for instance, or entering in an illegal manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-15T16:02:24.642834", "ruling_date": "2017-03-15T16:17:36", "ruling_headline": "Is being in the United States unlawfully a 'crime'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "being-united-states-unlawfully-crime", "ruling_link_text": "Not a crime by itself", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ingrid M.
