Consider state government spending numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Other than South Dakota -- and I think it&rsquo;s because we just don&rsquo;t have as many moose -- we have the lowest per-capita spending of any state in the nation,&quot; Abrams said in a March 27 speech. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second lowest per-capita spending of any state? We asked Abrams to tell us more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(This item will not evaluate Abrams&rsquo; moose claim, though we warn her that she may receive calls from irate fans of South Dakota elk. Elk are <a href=\"http://gfp.sd.gov/hunting/big-game/elk/\">common</a> there. Their moose cousins tend to live <a href=\"http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/wildlife/mbsp/fs/moose.html\">further north and to the west.</a> )<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeaders in Georgia and elsewhere regularly argue over whether state employees get enough pay. Some, such as state Rep. Jan Jones, a Republican from north Fulton County, argue that if you consider teacher benefits and salary package as a whole, they&rsquo;re paid well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia gave Jones a Half True on a claim that Georgia ranks first nationally in teacher salary and benefits if you adjust for cost of living.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new 2013 budget does not include cost-of-living pay raises for most of the state&#39;s more than 200,000 teachers and employees. They have not received them since shortly after the start of the Great Recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2011 <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-01-1Apublicworkers01_ST_N.htm\">analysis</a> by USA Today shows that Georgia public employees make less than those in other states, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether the study adjusts for the state&rsquo;s cost of living.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbrams pointed us to data from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a think tank that focuses on state issues, for more information on per-capita spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGenerally speaking, state per-capita spending is the amount of money the state spends in a fiscal year on things such as salaries and services, divided by the state&rsquo;s population. Policymakers often use the figure to argue that a state is spending too much or too little. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGBPI sent us rankings its researchers made with data from the Tax Policy Center, &nbsp;a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks. The Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s research is widely used by experts with different political leanings. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s data is based on numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s annual survey of state and local finances, which is a common source of information for state policy experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGBPI used 2009 data, the latest numbers available, to compare Georgia with other states and the District of Columbia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia spent $6,543.81 per capita, ranking 49th out of 51, or third from the bottom.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe two highest were Alaska and the District of Columbia. Alaska spent $17,802, &nbsp;while D.C. spent $16,906. &nbsp;Pennsylvania is at the median, spending $7,780 &nbsp;a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbrams was close, but not quite on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, there&rsquo;s more than one way to rank state spending per capita.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GBPI ranked Georgia by a measure that combines spending by state and local governments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResearchers often prefer this measure because statewide governments split the cost of services with their local counterparts in different ways, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor instance, one state may prefer to shoulder most of the costs of education on the state level, while others may prefer to fund education at the local level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe census also collects spending by states only, so we took a look at its 2009 data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia was tied for last place in total state spending. It tied with Florida for second-to-last place in &quot;direct expenditures,&quot; a slightly different measure that excludes intergovernmental spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone of these data show South Dakota trailing Georgia in per-capita spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegardless, these data all support Abrams&rsquo; broader point. In 2009, Georgia was near the bottom in state per-capita spending. According to one measure -- total state spending -- it&rsquo;s tied for second.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Abrams&rsquo; statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-02T16:51:37.863167", "ruling_date": "2012-04-03T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Abrams: State per-capita spending among lowest in nation", "ruling_headline_slug": "abrams-state-capita-spending-next-last", "ruling_link_text": "Al-moose correct", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSpeech, Stacey Abrams, state minority leader, Georgia General Assembly, Atlanta Press Club luncheon, March 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Stacey Abrams, state minority leader, Georgia General Assembly, March 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Alan Essig, executive director, Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, March 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Kim Rueben, senior fellow, Tax Policy Center, March 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpreadsheet, state and local per-capita expenditures, Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, received March 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, Tax Facts, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/slf-dqs/\">State and Local Finance Data Query System</a>, accessed March 28 and 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual, Part 2: Government Finance Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/govs/www/06classificationmanual/chapter05.html#p2c5intro\">Chapter 5</a>, accessed March 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-government/lawmakers-approve-19-3-1398596.html\">Lawmakers approve $19.3 billion spending plan for upcoming year</a>,&quot; March 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/feb/22/jan-jones/ga-head-class-teacher-compensation/\">Is Ga. at the head of the class in teacher compensation?</a>&quot;, Feb. 22, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "House Minority Leader, Georgia General Assembly", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Stacey", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "", "id": 1788, "last_name": "Abrams", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "stacey-abrams", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Abrams.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1788/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;We have the lowest per-capita spending of any state in the nation&quot; except for South Dakota.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech before the Atlanta Press Club", "statement_date": "2012-03-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
