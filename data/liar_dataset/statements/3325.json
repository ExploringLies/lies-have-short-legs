Scott Walker insists that the purpose of his <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf\">budget-repair bill</a>, which has become the focus of national debate, is to erase state budget deficits that are projected to exceed $3 billion by 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut some of his critics seem certain that what Walker and other Republican leaders really want is to get rid of public employee unions entirely.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee) went so far as to say, like Hitler, the governor was abolishing unions. We ruled that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/22/lena-taylor/wisconsin-state-sen-lena-taylor-d-milwaukee-says-h/\">Pants on Fire</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what if one of the GOP leaders actually did say that the true aim is to get rid of unions?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust such a bombshell was dropped Feb. 21, 2011 by Madison lawyer <a href=\"http://www.gmmattorneys.com/attorney_edwardrgarvey.html\">Ed Garvey</a>, a former Democratic nominee for governor and U.S. Senate in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a Capital Times opinion <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/opinion/column/ed_garvey/article_dae924f1-79fd-5cea-ae65-e3201cda019e.html\">column</a> about Walker&rsquo;s bill, Garvey attributed this quote to one of the state&rsquo;s top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&amp;district=13%20\">Scott Fitzgerald</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGarvey&rsquo;s column, which was <a href=\"http://www.fightingbob.com/article.cfm?articleID=1281\">republished</a> the next day on <a href=\"http://fightingbob.com/\">FightingBob.com</a>, an opinion website run by Garvey, reported the statement as a direct quote from the Juneau lawmaker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the quote is accurate, it would be a potentially explosive development in the stalemate over Walker&rsquo;s budget-repair bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we go further, let&rsquo;s be clear about the Walker bill in terms of how it would affect public employee unions. We&rsquo;ll rely on a breakdown we provided in a previous <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/17/afl-cio/wisconsin-afl-cio-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-re/\">PolitiFact item</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill eliminates all collective bargaining rights for thousands of public employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor a much larger group -- including schoolteachers, local government workers and about half of 76,000 state workers -- collective bargaining could be done only for pay (and negotiated raises would be limited to inflation).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly state troopers and local police and fire employees would be exempted. The bill, of course, does not affect private-sector unions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker has argued the collective bargaining changes are needed not just for the short-term budget, but for future budgets at the state and local level -- to give local units of government flexibility in cutting costs. Union leaders say they are an unwarranted attack on public employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not trying to settle that debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re looking at the quote Garvey attributes to Fitzgerald, that &quot;it is necessary to eliminate unions&quot; to balance future budgets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called and e-mailed Garvey on Feb. 24 and 25, 2011, asking for the source of the quote he attributed to Fitzgerald. He did not reply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince he did not reply, we turned elsewhere.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSearches of Google and the Nexis database also turned up no such Fitzgerald quote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe put the purported quote directly to Fitzgerald, who said: &quot;I have never said that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, how does this all shake out?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an opinion column, Garvey attributed this quote to Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald: &quot;It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets.&quot; It was a quote that, if accurate, would have gained much public notice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGarvey did not respond to requests for proof that Fitzgerald made the statement; we couldn&rsquo;t find any; and Fitzgerald denied making such a statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Garvey&rsquo;s claim as False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(Editor&rsquo;s note: Garvey returned our call on Feb. 28, 2011, after this item was posted.
