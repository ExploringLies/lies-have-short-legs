Evan Jenkins, boasted about his efforts to rein in the agency. &quot;I&rsquo;ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We&rsquo;ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA,&quot; he said. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEo_1FbllP8\">It&rsquo;s around 29:30 in the video</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the two parts of this statement separately -- first, the agency&rsquo;s budget, and second, its employment level.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">EPA&rsquo;s budget</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenkins would have been more accurate if he&rsquo;d said &quot;we&rsquo;ve&quot; cut half a billion dollars, as he did in the second part of his statement. Obviously, in our constitutional system of checks and balances, individual U.S. House members cannot cut an agency&rsquo;s budget on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the more substantive question, however, Jenkins was on target. In fact, he lowballed it a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical data from the<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hist04z1-fy2019.xlsx\"> Office of Management and Budget</a>, shows spending by the EPA at $8.725 billion in 2016; $8.165 billion in 2017; and an estimated $7.916 billion in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two-year difference between 2016 and 2018 is $809 million, which is more than half a billion dollars, or a 9.2 percent reduction over that two-year span.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual amount allowed by the <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/DIV%20G%20INTERIOR%20SOM%20FY18%20OMNI.OCR.pdf\">omnibus spending bill</a> passed after OMB made its estimate is slightly higher for 2018 -- $8.058 billion. But even at that higher level, the two-year decrease exceeds the half-billion-dollar figure Jenkins cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart showing EPA&rsquo;s budget going back to 2009:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So Jenkins&rsquo; budget number appears solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">EPA employment</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For employment, we used a data tool created by the federal Office of Management and Budget called <a href=\"https://www.fedscope.opm.gov/employment.asp\">FedScope</a>, which federal employment gurus consider the most accurate information available. FedScope provides detailed employment data on a quarterly basis; the most recent quarter available at the time of Jenkins&rsquo; comment was September 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For simplicity, we took note of EPA employment in September of every year. In September 2015, EPA employed 15,445 people; in September 2016, it employed 15,634; and in September 2017, it employed 15,058.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over this two-year period, EPA employment fell by 387 people -- well short of the 3,000 Jenkins cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way you can achieve a decrease of 3,000 EPA employees is by comparing the September 2017 level to the September 2012 level -- a five-year period that started before Jenkins was even in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, EPA employment in 2012 was boosted by spending through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- more commonly known as the stimulus bill signed by President Barack Obama. So a chunk of the jobs lost since then were always intended to be temporary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This chart shows EPA employment every September going back to 2009, according to FedScope:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the Partnership for Public Service, a group that studies federal employment, to look at our math, they agreed that it was accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenkins&rsquo; campaign said the candidate was referring to a <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/03.21.18_fy18_omnibus_-_interior_-_summary.pdf\">news release</a> from the House Appropriations Committee that mentioned a decline of 3,106 jobs at the EPA since 2010 -- a longer period than a listener would have assumed hearing Jenkins&rsquo; comments at the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When more recent data is released, it may show additional decreases in employment at EPA. An EPA plan for a government shutdown in <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-04/documents/epa_contingency_plan_for_shutdown_april_24_2017.pdf\">December</a> 2017 said the agency had a staff of 14,449, which was down from the prior shutdown plan in <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-04/documents/epa_contingency_plan_for_shutdown_april_24_2017.pdf\">April</a>, which cited a staff size of 15,219, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/epa-employees-leaving-under-pruitt-11b36a220062/\">according to</a> the liberal website ThinkProgress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a decline of 770, but it&rsquo;s still not as high as the 3,000 Jenkins noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenkins said, &quot;I&rsquo;ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We&rsquo;ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting aside his choice of &quot;I&quot; rather than &quot;we,&quot; Jenkins has a point about the decrease in the EPA&rsquo;s budget; in anything, his estimate is actually low. On employment, though, 3,000 jobs shed is an overzealous estimate. To get a number that large, you have to go back at least to 2012, before Jenkins was in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-25T15:18:30.761241", "ruling_date": "2018-04-26T11:41:17", "ruling_headline": "How much have Republicans cut EPA budget, staff in two years?", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-much-have-republicans-cut-epa-budget-staff-two", "ruling_link_text": "Right on budget, not on staff", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Republican U.S. Senate primary debate, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEo_1FbllP8\">video</a>, April 23, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Appropriations Committee, &quot;<a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/03.21.18_fy18_omnibus_-_interior_-_summary.pdf\">Fiscal Year 2018 Interior and Environment Bill</a>,&quot; March 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hist04z1-fy2019.xlsx\">Table 4.1&mdash;Outlays by Agency: 1962&ndash;2023</a>, accessed April 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Personnel Management, <a href=\"https://www.fedscope.opm.gov/employment.asp\">FedScope main page</a>, accessed April 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa/epa-workforce-shrinking-to-reagan-era-levels-agency-official-idUSKCN1BH1LY\">EPA workforce shrinking to Reagan-era levels &mdash; agency official</a>,&quot; Sept. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ThinkProgress, &quot;<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/epa-employees-leaving-under-pruitt-11b36a220062/\">More than 700 employees have left the EPA since Scott Pruitt took over</a>,&quot; Dec,14, 2017,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Erika Walter, press secretary for the Partnership for Public Service, April 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, April 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Andy Ser&eacute;, spokesman for Evan Jenkins, April 25, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Evan", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 4079, "last_name": "Jenkins", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "evan-jenkins", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/jenkins.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4079/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years.
