Scott Walker put property tax relief near the top of his bragging list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home,&quot; Walker said during the WISN-TV debate at the Marquette University Law School.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs his claim on the money?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s office pointed to the annual estimates from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Those <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Informational-Papers/Documents/20\">reports</a> show an <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2011-13-Budget/Documents/Joint%20Finance/2011_06_13_WI%20Leg_Property%20Tax%20Estimates.pdf\">upward trend</a> in the property tax bill for a median-valued home, from 2000 to 2010. Some years it was close to flat; the year-to-year increases ranged from a tiny 0.1 percent to 4.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis leads us to 2011, the first year under Walker and his budget&rsquo;s tight limits on local property tax increases. Those caps included a virtual freeze on the ability of local governments to increase the tax levy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn preliminary estimates during the budget process, the Fiscal Bureau projected the median residential bill would go up. But Walker&rsquo;s administration -- using actual figures reported by schools and municipal governments -- <a href=\"http://www.channel3000.com/news/Walker-says-property-taxes-dropped-slightly/-/1648/10921262/-/755ej2z/-/index.html\">announced</a> in April 2012 that the bill for a median-priced home in 2011 saw a 0.4 percent drop.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, that doesn&rsquo;t mean every homeowner&rsquo;s bill went down, just that a median-valued home would see a small drop. The approach is simply a way of roughly measuring year-to-year changes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Walker&rsquo;s claim appears on target, the overall amount of property taxes collected in the state will likely go up a bit, not down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reason: Walker is using a typical residential home, not looking at the total of all residential collections, and his figures does not include commercial and agricultural property.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Fiscal Bureau is still checking the administration&rsquo;s math and fine-tuning the numbers, but so far the data clearly supports a decrease, said Fred Ammerman, the Fiscal Bureau&rsquo;s property tax program supervisor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the fact the numbers are not final adds a note of caution to the mix.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the figure Walker cited is a commonly used benchmark that last dropped from 1999 to 2000. And he made it clear he was talking about just residential property.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Walker&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-01T15:16:32.615701", "ruling_date": "2012-06-01T14:17:31", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
