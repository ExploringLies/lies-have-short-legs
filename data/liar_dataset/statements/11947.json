He said the Republican National Committee offers debate tickets to the big donors for each presidential candidate and, as such, Trump supporters are shut out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you know, Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we don&rsquo;t have any donors,&quot; Lewandowski said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seconds later, Lewandowski added: &quot;We have only one donor to the campaign, so we can submit only one name. His name is Donald Trump, and he already has a spot on that stage, and he&rsquo;s always at the center of that stage because he&rsquo;s the front runner.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start by noting the RNC disputes Lewandowski&rsquo;s claim that debate tickets are reserved for the highest donors, saying each of the five campaigns participating in the South Carolina event - including Trump&rsquo;s - were given <a href=\"https://www.gop.com/memo-debate-ticket-allocation/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>107 passes</u></a> to distribute as they pleased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subject of this fact-check is not debate tickets but Lewandowski&rsquo;s repeated claim that the billionaire Trump is the &quot;only&quot; contributor to his campaign. Trump often says he&rsquo;s &quot;self-financing&quot; his campaign, a statement our colleagues at PolitiFact National recently rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-self-funding-his-campaign-sort/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half-True</u></a>. Lewandowski&rsquo;s assertion that there are no outside donors to the campaign, however, takes Trump&rsquo;s claim to a new level and deserves a separate look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Trump&rsquo;s campaign for an explanation of Lewandowski&rsquo;s comments but did not get a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contributions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015, according to the latest <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/press/summaries/2016/tables/presidential/presreceipts_2015_q4.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Federal Election Commission records</u></a>. Trump put in $12.8 million of that himself. The remaining $6.6 million came from individual contributions, which federal law<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/03/23/are-you-rich-here-how-much-you-can-donate-to-candidates-in-2016/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>caps</u></a> at $2,700 per candidate per election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has invested far more of his personal money into his campaign than any other presidential contender. The only other candidates endowing their own campaigns are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;Republican Jeb Bush, $388,720, or 1.2 percent of $31.9 million he raised;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;Democrat Hillary Clinton, $368,147, or 0.3 percent of the $115.6 million she raised; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;Republican Ben Carson, $25,000, or 0.05 percent of the $54 million he raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, by contrast, has put in 66 percent of the money his campaign has raised. But the remaining 34 percent, contrary to Lewandowski&rsquo;s claim, has come from donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FEC rules require candidates to disclose the names of donors who have contributed an aggregate $200 or more to their campaigns. Through the end of 2015, Trump listed about 3,200 such patrons who donated a collective $1.6 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A far greater number of people made small donations to the campaign, but we can&rsquo;t tell you how many because these names and contributions are not itemized. What we do know is that Trump, at year&rsquo;s end, raised almost $5 million from people who sent in less than $200 apiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although a significant portion of his campaign fund comes from individuals, Trump doesn&rsquo;t appear to be actively soliciting these donations with high-profile fundraising events. The Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in money in politics, tracks political fundraisers with its Political Party Time tool.<a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/search/Beneficiary/Donald%20Trump/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>It has no record of any events to benefit Trump</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, Political Party Time has recorded more than 280 fundraisers for<a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/pol/N00000019/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Clinton</u></a> and more than 150 for<a href=\"http://politicalpartytime.org/pol/N00037006/?sort=start_date&amp;order=1&amp;page=2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Bush</u></a> since the start of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, however, a &quot;<a href=\"https://secure.donaldjtrump.com/donate/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>donate</u></a>&quot; button on Trump&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, any conversation about Trump&rsquo;s &quot;self-financed&quot; campaign also should include two caveats:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;Of the personal money he&rsquo;s put into his campaign, Trump lists $200,000 as a contribution and $12.6 million as loans. That means he may expect to recoup those funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;Trump ramped up his self-financing in the final quarter of 2015, when he made $10.8 million of his loans to his campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we don&rsquo;t have any donors,&quot; Lewandowski, Trump&rsquo;s campaign manager, told a Virginia radio audience. Seconds later, he virtually repeated the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is certainly his own greatest benefactor, having endowed his campaign with $12.8 million of the $19.4 million it raised through the end of last year - or 66 percent of its funds. Trump lists almost all of his investments in his campaign as a loan, not a donation, so he may be expecting to get some of his money back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, Lewandowski is flat-out wrong by insisting the campaign has no donors other than Trump. He ignores thousands of supporters who contributed $6.6 million through the end of last year, or 34 percent of the campaign&rsquo;s resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-21T22:20:33.027058", "ruling_date": "2016-02-22T11:40:00", "ruling_headline": "Trump campaign manager: 'We don't have any donors'", "ruling_headline_slug": "trumps-campaign-manager-we-dont-have-any-donors", "ruling_link_text": "Trump has thousands of donors", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Corey Lewandowski, National manager for Donald Trump campaign, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGcD9ib9vBw\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Interview on the John Frederick Show</u></a>, Feb. 15, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Election Commission,<a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/press/summaries/2016/tables/presidential/presreceipts_2015_q4.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> Presidential prenomination campaign receipts through Dec. 31, 2015</u></a>, accessed Feb. 16, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Election Commission, <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandCmteTransaction.do\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Itemized individual contributions to Donald Trump through Dec. 31, 2015</u></a>, accessed Feb. 17, 2106.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-self-funding-his-campaign-sort/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Is Donald Trump self-funding his campaign?
