He was accused of being an accomplice in the murder of about 300,000 Hungarian Jews, and though he maintained that he only played an office role managing money confiscated from Jews at the death camp, he admitted to witnessing atrocities, including the gassing of Jews who had tried to escape. He was sentenced to four years in jail at age 94.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros, meanwhile, fled fascism. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, his father obtained false identities for Soros and his brother, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/magazine/george-soros-democrat-open-society.html\">2018 profile</a> of the billionaire in the New York Times. He sent Soros to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The official&rsquo;s job included taking inventory of a confiscated Jewish-owned property,&quot; according to the story. &quot;He took George with him. These episodes have become the basis for the claim that George was a Nazi collaborator. In fact, though, there is no credible evidence that he collaborated with or was sympathetic to Nazis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-31T10:22:05.925665", "ruling_date": "2018-10-31T10:16:10", "ruling_headline": "Viral photo of SS officer is not George Soros", "ruling_headline_slug": "viral-photo-ss-officer-not-george-soros", "ruling_link_text": "t\u2019s an old photo of Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, one of 300 Auschwitz staff members", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215282100399711&amp;set=a.10215282100159705&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">post</a>, Oct. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/how-nazi-guard-oskar-groning-escaped-justice-in-1947-for-crimes-at-auschwitz\">&quot;How Nazi guard Oskar Gr&ouml;ning escaped justice in 1947 for crimes at Auschwitz,&quot;</a> July 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/obituaries/oskar-groning-the-bookkeeper-of-auschwitz-is-dead-at-96.html\">&quot;Oskar Gr&ouml;ning, the &lsquo;Bookkeeper of Auschwitz,&rsquo; is dead at 96,&quot;</a> March 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/magazine/george-soros-democrat-open-society.html\">&quot;George Soros bet big on liberal democracy.
