On Feb. 6, 2012, the day Allen&rsquo;s interview was posted on Bearing Drift, that cost had risen to $3.44.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo between those two dates, the price of gas per gallon increased by $1.61.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo measure how that translates into higher costs for each fill-up, Dan Allen also sent us links to a Department of Energy website listing the fuel-tank capacity for various vehicles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2012 Ford Explorer, an SUV, has an 18.6 gallon tank, which means the cost of filling up is about $29.95 more than when Obama took office. A Dodge Caravan minivan with a 20-gallon tank costs $32.20 more to fill, and a Buick LaCrosse, a mid-size car with an 18-gallon tank, costs $28.98 more to fill up. In the compact car category, Allen&rsquo;s campaign noted a 2012 Camaro has a 19-gallon tank. That means the Camaro owner is paying $30.59 more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose are all close to Allen&rsquo;s number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course there are many cars on the road with fuel tanks that hold less than the 18-20 gallon capacities that Allen cites. The gas tank capacity of the Toyota Corolla, which Edmunds.com says is the world&rsquo;s best selling car of all time, is 13.2 gallons for the 2011 model. That means the owner of that car is paying $21.26 more for each tank of gas than they were when Obama entered the White House. That&rsquo;s higher than January 2009, but still less than the figure Allen cites.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen&rsquo;s statement also implies that Obama deserves blame for the higher gas costs. We ran that past a couple of analysts to see what they thought.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;(The president) has very little control over gas prices,&quot; said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at gasbuddy.com. &quot;It has less to do with the president&rsquo;s policies and more to do with supply and demand and the fundamentals of the industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeHaan acknowledged that prices risen considerably since Obama took office. But he was quick to add there should &quot;be a massive asterisk&quot; next to that statement. A big reason prices were so low to begin with when Obama became president was because he entered the White House as the U.S. was coming out of an economic downturn, which depresses gas prices, DeHaan said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBen Brockwell, the director of data, pricing and information services at the Oil Price Information Service, said it&rsquo;s ridiculous to pin gas prices on any president, Republican or Democrat, saying fuel costs are a &quot;market phenomenon.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrockwell noted that under former President George W. Bush, the price of gas hit its all-time high of $4.16 on July 16, 2008. And, Brockwell noted, Bush wasn&rsquo;t to blame for that situation either. &quot;The fact of the matter is Obama is no more to blame than Bush was in &lsquo;08 when (oil) prices went to $150 a barrel,&quot; Brockwell said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen said the cost of filling up a tank of gas costs $30 more now than when Obama took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe price of a gallon of gas is nearly twice what it was when Obama took office. Allen&rsquo;s use of the $30 figure is a bit of a broad brush, since that assumes the capacities of 18-20 gallon tanks, and many cars have smaller gas tanks. But we don&rsquo;t think the $30 extra fill-up costs is an unreasonable figure to use, because it would be the higher cost for many cars on the road.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that doesn&rsquo;t mean Obama is to blame for motorists&rsquo; pain at the pump. Analysts told us presidents in general have little impact on the gas prices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers are correct. But Allen is misrepresenting the cause of the increase. Therefore, we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-20T09:34:28.633392", "ruling_date": "2012-02-20T09:27:57", "ruling_headline": "George Allen says price of gas tank fill-up has risen $30 during Obama's term", "ruling_headline_slug": "president-doesnt-control-gas-prices", "ruling_link_text": "Presidents don't control gas prices", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBearing Drift, <a href=\"http://bearingdrift.com/2012/02/06/george-allen-obamas-overreach-and-the-need-for-a-robust-domestic-energy-policy/\">&quot;George Allen: Obama&rsquo;s overreach and the need for a robust energy policy,&quot;</a> Feb. 6, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/\">&quot;Gas and diesel fuel update,&quot;</a> accessed Feb. 15, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Dan Allen, senior advisor to George Allen&rsquo;s campaign, Feb. 15, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at gasbuddy.com, Feb. 15, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Ben Brockwell, director of data, pricing and information services at the Oil Price Information Service, Feb. 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, Feb. 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Martha Meade, manager of public and government affairs at AAA mid-Atlantic, Feb. 15, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartment of Energy, <a href=\"http://www.fueleconomy.gov/\">Fueleconomy.gov,</a> accessed Feb. 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorge Allen op-ed in The Washington Times, <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/9/obama-is-pumping-pain/#\">&quot;Obama is pumping pain &hellip; Poor policies lead to predictably high fuel prices,&quot;</a> March 9, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Texas, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/may/22/michael-williams/michael-williams-says-gas-prices-are-2-obama-becam/\">&quot;Michael Williams says gas prices are up $2 since Obama took office,&quot;</a> May 22, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/mar/23/johnny-isakson/isakson-obama-policies-fuel-higher-gas-prices/\">&quot;Isakson: Obama policies fuel higher gas prices,&quot;</a> March 23, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/08/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-gasoline-cost-179-gallon-whe/\">&quot;Michele Bachmann says gasoline cost $1.79 a gallon when Barack Obama took office,&quot;</a> Sept. 7, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactCheck.org, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2011/03/is-obama-to-blame-for-4-gasoline/\">&quot;Is Obama to blame for $4 gasoline?&quot;</a> March 24, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-arab-spring-sent-gas-prices-high/\">&quot;Barack Obama says Arab Spring sent gas prices higher,&quot;</a> Oct. 6, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEdmunds.com, <a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla/2011/\">2011 Toyota Corolla,</a> accessed Feb. 17, 2012.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "consultant", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "George", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 831, "last_name": "Allen", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "george-allen", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/George__Allen.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/831/", "total_count": 27, "true_count": 8, "website": "http://www.georgeallen.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe cost of&nbsp;a gas tank fill-up has risen&nbsp;$30 since&nbsp;Barack Obama became president.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview.", "statement_date": "2012-02-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 204, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/204/", "subject": "Gas Prices", "subject_slug": "gas-prices", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
