His last words, &quot;I can&rsquo;t breathe,&quot; became a slogan at protests across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been quoted over and over about what&#39;s going on as far as it&#39;s more of a notion to the family, more than anything. Obviously, as a society we have to do better. We have to be better for one another,&quot; James said in 2014. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what race you are. It&#39;s more of a shout out to the family more than anything, because they&#39;re the ones that should be getting all the energy and effort.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, James chided President Donald Trump, who lashed out at the Golden State Warriors&rsquo; Stephen Curry for refusing to visit the White House with his championship team. James <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/911610455877021697\">called Trump a &quot;bum&quot;on Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-defends-calling-trump-bum-stephen-curry-nba-nfl-protest-national-anthem-twitter-2017-9\">later added that Trump</a> &quot;doesn&#39;t understand the power that he has&quot; as president. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The older photo of James has been altered to make it look like he was wearing something he wasn&rsquo;t.
