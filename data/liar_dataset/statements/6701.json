Zero. Under Romney? 89 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama&rsquo;s health care law forbids insurers from using someone&rsquo;s health or lack of it to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/reports/preexisting.html\">determine eligibility, benefits or premiums</a>.&quot; Romney, the Republican candidate for president, has promised an effort to <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care\">repeal the law</a>. But he says that people with pre-existing conditions, as long as they&rsquo;ve been insured in the past, shouldn&rsquo;t be denied coverage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(He introduced confusion for a day Sept. 9, 2012, when he told NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em> that, &quot;I&#39;m not getting rid of all of health care reform. Of course, there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I&#39;m going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage.&quot; But his aides quickly clarified he still meant protection just for those who had maintained &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/us/politics/romneys-pledge-shows-repealing-health-law-to-be-complex.html\">continuous coverage</a>.&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wanted to know: Could 89 million people be vulnerable to insurers using pre-existing conditions to deny them health coverage under Romney?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s some support for this statistic &mdash; alongside significant caveats.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The Romney plan</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care\">health care plan</a> doesn&rsquo;t pack a lot of details, and his campaign didn&rsquo;t answer our requests for clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he has consistently said that the Affordable Care Act should go away, and that people with health conditions who have &quot;maintained <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-03-22/mitt-romney-health-reform-repeal-obamacare/53711598/1\"> continuous health insurance coverage</a> should be guaranteed the ability to retain coverage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats argue that means people who suffer gaps in coverage &mdash; after, say, a lost job &mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t be protected under Romney. And that&rsquo;s where the &quot;89 million&quot; figure comes from: <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/In-the-Literature/2012/Aug/Gaps-and-Transitions-in-Health-Insurance.aspx\">a recent study</a> of the number of people who lost insurance coverage for at least a month between 2003 and 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/10/who-would-be-left-out-of-romneys-preexisting-conditions-plan-about-89-million-americans/\">The idea is</a> that if some of those 89 million happened to have a pre-existing condition, a gap in their health insurance could mean &quot;denied coverage&quot; later. But it&rsquo;s not that simple.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked out a summary of the August 2012 study from the <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/In-the-Literature/2012/Aug/Gaps-and-Transitions-in-Health-Insurance.aspx\">Commonwealth Fund</a>, and chatted with one of its authors and several other health care experts about the accuracy of the campaign claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you take it very literally, it&#39;s accurate,&quot; said Pamela Short, one of the Commonwealth Fund study authors, who was a health care expert on President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers. &quot;... It doesn&#39;t mean it would, but it could.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther experts were less generous.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and founding editor of conservative magazine <em>National Review</em>, called the statistic &quot;absurd and false.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how both of them are right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; The 89 million encompasses those with coverage gaps &mdash; not necessarily those with pre-existing conditions. Estimates of how many Americans actually have pre-existing conditions vary widely.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Even if Obamacare disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq_consumer_hipaa.html\">less than 63 days</a>. Health experts we talked to assumed Romney would basically firm up the requirements of that law &mdash; which applies primarily to people with employer-based coverage, not less common individual policies &mdash; and perhaps strengthen it so it also applied to the individual market. But the group in the study is bigger than that, including those with coverage gaps of &quot;at least one month.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; That same law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, only allows insurers to look back <a href=\"http://www.familiesusa.org/issues/private-insurance/legal-rights/hipaa-definitions.html\">18 months</a> for coverage gaps of 63 days or more. But the study tallied those who had gaps over a four-year period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; The study looked at people ages 4 to 64 with public and private health care coverage. But people who qualify for Medicaid, for example, couldn&rsquo;t be at risk for being &quot;denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Some people rejected for coverage for pre-existing conditions before the Affordable Care Act qualified for insurance through state-run &quot;high-risk pools,&quot; an idea Romney includes in his health care proposals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the Obama campaign claim is true only under the most literal reading of Romney&rsquo;s approach &mdash; that &quot;continuous coverage&quot; could mean exactly that, with no allowances even for short gaps protected under the law for many people since the 1990s. (And even then, you&rsquo;d have to subtract people who could take advantage of public insurance and high-risk pools.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, conservative health experts say that the group of reforms recommended by Romney, which focus on separating health insurance from employment, would cut down on gaps in health coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The idea is that you create a new system in which it&#39;s much easier to get insurance yourself, give people a window (a kind of open season) to get insured in that system if they&#39;re not already insured, and then after that protect those who are from then on continuously insured,&quot; Levin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> The ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign says that under Romney, 89 million Americans could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition. Democrats point to Romney&rsquo;s promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act as evidence, along with Romney&rsquo;s statements that people should be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;89 million&quot; comes from a study that looked at coverage gaps, without a focus on pre-existing conditions. Some of those 89 million &mdash; those on public insurance, or whose gaps were less than 63 days or more than 18 months old, or who qualified for high-risk pools &mdash; could be protected in a non-Affordable Care Act world. That reduces the number of people who could suffer coverage denials.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while Romney would work to repeal blanket protection for people with pre-existing conditions, the claim that he could expose &quot;89 million&quot; to the possibility of denied coverage is only partially accurate, and leaves out important details.
