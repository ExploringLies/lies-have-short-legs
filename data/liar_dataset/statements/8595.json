Mark Warner, a Democrat who&rsquo;s up for reelection next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Nov. 18 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/ken-cuccinelli-reflects-on-losing-virginias-governors-race-talks-about-whats-next/2013/11/18/e5ddee64-5081-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html\"><u>article</u></a> in The Washington Post, Cuccinelli said he found the idea of running against Warner &quot;tempting,&quot; particularly given the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, &nbsp;which Warner helped pass in the Senate. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You were the tiebreaking vote,&quot; Cuccinelli said of Warner and his support for the ACA, also known as Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Warner really did cast the tiebreaking ballot that allowed Obamacare to survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Cuccinelli, told us Warner provided the critical vote in 2009 that prevented a Senate filibuster on the ACA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(Sixty) votes were needed to avoid a filibuster and allow the legislation to pass, so there was not one vote to spare&quot; Gottstein wrote in an e-mail. &quot;Mark Warner provided that vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gottstein was referring to the Senate&rsquo;s cloture rule that requires 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00395\"><u>voted</u></a> 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396\"><u>vote</u></a>. But Warner&rsquo;s vote wasn&rsquo;t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s return to the filibuster-breaking roll call. No doubt, Warner&rsquo;s vote was crucial to ending debate, as were ballots of 59 other senators. But does that mean that Warner was &quot;the tiebreaking vote,&quot; as Cuccinelli says?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that Republicans and conservative groups across the country have accused a lot of the Democratic senators of casting the key vote that unchained Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact national <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jun/14/deciding-vote-all-60-them/\"><u>noted</u></a> in June 2012 the 60 Plus Association ran an ad claiming Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., cast &nbsp;&quot;the deciding vote&quot; that passed the law. In Ohio&rsquo;s senate race last year, Republican Josh Mandel <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/may/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-cast-deciding-vote-/\"><u>said</u></a> Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown cast &quot;the deciding vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Michigan, Pennsylvania and Missouri, conservatives charged that Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow, Bob Casey and Claire McCaskill, respectively, were each &nbsp;&quot;the deciding vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget New Hampshire, where GOP candidate Jim Rubens <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/19/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-claims-us-senator-jeanne-shaheen-d-nh-w/\"><u>said</u></a> earlier this month that Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was &quot;the deciding vote&quot; to pass Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s six &quot;deciding votes&quot; even before Warner was added to the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner&rsquo;s vote was hardly a mystery in late 2009 as the Senate neared the 60-vote majority to end debate. The Virginia Democrat, in a floor speech that Sept. 23, urged Congress to move forward on health care reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Los Angeles Times, in a Dec. 24, 2009 <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/24/nation/la-na-health-ticktock24-2009dec24\"><u>article</u></a>, said the final two holdouts to join the super majority were Sens. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., and Ben Nelson, D-Neb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli said Warner provided &quot;the tiebreaking vote&quot; that allowed Obamacare to become reality. There&rsquo;s a sliver of truth here in that Warner did indeed provide a crucial vote that helped Democrats get to the 60 votes needed to advance the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s misleading to say he cast &quot;the vote&quot; when Warner was joined by 59 other senators who, by Cuccinelli&rsquo;s rationale, also would have cast the tie-breaking vote. Warner was not among the last holdouts that boosted the Senate to a super majority; he made his intentions known three months before the vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-25T08:12:15.019550", "ruling_date": "2013-11-25T08:06:35", "ruling_headline": "Cuccinelli says Warner cast \"the tiebreaking vote\" on Obamacare", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuccinelli-says-warner-cast-tiebreaking-vote-obama", "ruling_link_text": "59 others also cast \"the tiebreaking vote\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/ken-cuccinelli-reflects-on-losing-virginias-governors-race-talks-about-whats-next/2013/11/18/e5ddee64-5081-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html\"><u>&quot;Ken Cuccinelli reflects on losing Virginia governor&rsquo;s race, talks about what&rsquo;s next,&quot;</u></a> Nov. 19, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate roll call <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00395\"><u>vote </u></a>on whether to invoke cloture on the Affordable Care Act, Dec. 23, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate roll call <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396\"><u>vote </u></a>on passing the Affordable Care Act, Dec. 24, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_111_1.htm\"><u>&quot;U.S. Senate roll call votes 111th Congress - 1st session (2009),&quot;</u></a> accessed Nov. 20, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GovTrack.us <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3590\"><u>H.R.3590</u></a> (111th): Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, accessed Nov. 20, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen.
