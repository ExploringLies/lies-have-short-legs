The Senate Democrats&rsquo; collective <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenateDems\">Twitter account</a> documented the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The account posted a Spanish-language tweet featuring a clip of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talking about high gasoline prices and placing the blame on Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish-language text says: &quot;<em>El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este a&ntilde;o. Los analistas dicen que el presidente tiene la culpa. Gracias<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\"> @realDonaldTrump</a></em>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In English, that translates as: &quot;The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Analysts say the president is to blame. Thanks, Trump.&quot; (Menendez, speaking in Spanish in the tweet&rsquo;s uploaded video clip, didn&rsquo;t use those exact words and didn&rsquo;t cite a percentage increase.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So is the tweet correct that gas prices are up 25 percent since the start of the year? Not quite. While prices have increased, they haven&rsquo;t risen by that much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical clearinghouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&amp;f=W\">retail gasoline prices</a> were $2.52 a gallon on Jan. 1, 2018, and rose to $2.92 on May 21, 2018. That&rsquo;s an increase of 15.9 percent &mdash; a distinct bump, but smaller than the tweet had said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we looked at <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/RWTCD.htm\">crude oil prices</a>, the increase was a bit larger than for gasoline but still not 25 percent. On Jan. 2, 2018, crude was $60.37 a barrel and on May 21 it was $72.26. That&rsquo;s an increase of 19.7 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sandy Fielden, a commodities analyst at Morningstar Inc., <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/markets/commodities/oil/trump-may-be-more-to-blame-for-higher-oil-prices-than-opec-14563159\">told thestreet.com in late April</a> that Trump may be at least a partial cause of the price rise, citing threats of a trade war with China, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Fielden said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All these bearish factors pushing prices higher are arguably directly caused by Trump administration policies,&quot; Fielden told the website. Trump&rsquo;s suggestion that the OPEC oil-producing companies may be to blame for higher prices &quot;is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we inquired with the Democratic Senate leadership, the tweet was deleted and a replacement was posted. The new tweet&rsquo;s caption stuck closely to Menendez&rsquo; wording in the video, saying, &quot;<em>El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la pol&iacute;tica del presidente</em>.&quot; (That translates as, &quot;The price of gasoline keeps rising and rising. And it is, to a large extent, due to the president&#39;s policies.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic staff on the Senate Finance Committee subsequently told PolitiFact that the 25 percent figure stemmed from a &quot;math error&quot; and has since corrected the <a href=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Wyden%20Report%20-%20Trumps%20Tax%20Scam%20Hands%20Billions%20to%20Big%20Oil.pdf\">report</a> it came from.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The original version of the tweet said, &quot;El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este a&ntilde;o,&quot; which translates as, &quot;The price of gas has increased 25% this year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gas prices have risen, but not by that much &mdash; 15.9 percent, rather than 25 percent.
