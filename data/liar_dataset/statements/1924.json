Pres Obama's tax/spend  policy is quite The Situation. but I do rec wearing sunscreen!\"</p>\r\n<p>We should hope so.  McCain has a history of battling skin cancer.</p>\r\n<p>But let's get to the facts. Did President Barack Obama put a 10 percent  tax on tanning? On March 23, 2010, Obama signed the <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3590enr.txt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (aka  the health care bill) into law. And Chapter 49, SEC. 5000B makes this all very  clear: \"There is hereby imposed on any indoor tanning service a tax equal to 10  percent of the amount paid for such service.\"</p>\r\n<p>We were pretty sure Snooki was kidding about Obama  passing that provision specifically to stymie the <em>Jersey Shore </em>crew.</p>\r\n<p>But it turns out that  the president had mentioned her by name on May 2, 2010, and said she'd be exempt:  \"This next provision is called the Jersey Shore-Up,\" Obama said. \"It reads: 'The  following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this  bill: Snooki, J-WOWW, the Situation, and House Minority Leader John Boehner.'\"  (\"The Situation\" and \"JWOWW\" are other members of the <em>Jersey Shore </em>cast.)</p>\r\n<p>Alas, Obama's comment  was made during the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-white-house-correspondents-association-dinner\" target=\"_blank\">White House Correspondents Association Dinner</a>. In  other words, it was a joke.</p>\r\n<p>(Yes, it scares us too that Obama and McCain are  so familiar with <em>Jersey Shore.)</em></p>\r\n<p>If we really wanted to pick a fight with Snooki, we  could take issue with her saying it was a tax on tanning. There's no fee on  sunshine, just indoor tanning. Or that it's Obama's tax. There's no indication  an indoor tanning tax was Obama's idea.</p>\r\n<p>It was proposed by Senate Democrats in December as an  alternative to a proposed tax on cosmetic surgery. The cosmetic surgery lobby  (funded by plastic surgeons) apparently held more sway than the indoor tanning  lobby. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected the tax will  raise $2.7 billion over 10 years to help offset the cost of expanding medical  coverage. Legislators said they also hoped it might discourage teens from indoor  tanning, as some studies suggest it is linked to higher risk of cancer. The bill  was passed by Congress, but Obama signed it, so we think Snooki's assigning the  tax to Obama is fair.</p>\r\n<p>One other small point. The indoor tanning tax goes  into effect on July 1, 2010. So when Snooki made her comment, she still could've  gotten her tan on sans Uncle Sam's extra reach. But we're assuming Snooki isn't  so much worried about the money as the principle.</p>\r\n<p>We rate her comment  friggin' True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-18T17:14:43.140009", "ruling_date": "2010-06-21T12:15:21", "ruling_headline": "Snooki says Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning", "ruling_headline_slug": "snooki-says-obama-put-10-percent-tax-tannning", "ruling_link_text": "Snooki 2012", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Radar, <a href=\"http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/06/video-jersey-shore-cast-weathers-storm-sophomore-season-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Video: Special Preview Of Jersey Shore In Miami!</a>, June 7, 2010</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3590enr.txt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">H.
