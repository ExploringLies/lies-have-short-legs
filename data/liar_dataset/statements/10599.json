Then in swift succession, Robinson apparently hit a friend and, after entering a house, tried to strangle someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A police officer entered the home, got into a struggle with Robinson and shot him. Robinson was not armed. The officer was injured, but did not need to be hospitalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shooting quickly drew comparisons by some with other recent high-profile killings by police of black men across the country: Dontre Hamilton at Red Arrow Park in Milwaukee, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner in New York City. <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/students-plan-walkout-over-police-shooting-in-madison-b99458530z1-295613101.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Protests followed</u></a> Robinson&rsquo;s death.

An education system that has underserved people of color, high rates of unemployment and underemployment, a lack of suitable guardians or mentors for our youth (leading to greater gang involvement), challenged neighborhoods and a criminal justice system that is fraught with inadequacies are but a few of the drivers that contribute to the malaise we face as a community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, he added: &quot;Based on the diversity and the strength of character personified in our workforce, the training which is second to none and ever-striving for best practices, coupled with checks-and-balances that serve to bring rogue cops or practices to the light of day, I will not buy into the naive supposition that our community&#39;s disparity issues are largely owing to a pervasive pattern of systemic racism by MPD.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Koval about the eight times higher claim, he responded by email through a spokesman, saying that in his initial response to the open letter &quot;I was not disputing the fact that there are racial disparities; I dispute the fact that I have &lsquo;rogue&rsquo; cops or policies/procedures which are intrinsically racist. &nbsp;There is no doubt but that the police should be mindful of our role as the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, and therefore &lsquo;own&rsquo; part of this problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chief also noted that the figures from the report are for all of Dane County, not just Madison, which &quot;includes big bedroom communities&quot; such as Fitchburg&nbsp;and Sun Prairie.&nbsp;Koval said he has not seen any figures for only Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition said &quot;black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people&quot; in Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A report the coalition relies on says that in 2012, the arrest rate for black adults was eight times higher than for white adults.
