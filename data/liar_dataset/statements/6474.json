A lot of that has helped drive up costs. So the capital construction to expand access for New Jersey residents is critically important. If you think about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo New Jerseyans really represent nearly a third of all students across the country who go to an out-of-state school?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatistics from the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, highlight a major flaw in Greenwald&rsquo;s statement: far more than 100,000 students nationwide pursue a postsecondary education at an out-of-state institution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fall 2010 -- the most recent data available -- more than 515,000 freshmen across the country started college at an out-of-state school. Nearly 393,000 of those students finished high school in the previous year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Greenwald scores no points for accuracy there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrian McGinnis, Greenwald&rsquo;s communications director, said we were &quot;missing the forest for the trees.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&rsquo;s a serious brain drain that&rsquo;s disproportionately happening in New Jersey,&quot; he said, adding that Greenwald&rsquo;s overall point -- that New Jersey &quot;sends more homegrown students out of state than any other state&quot; -- was correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNearly 35,000 New Jerseyans left home to attend college for the first time in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 31,000 finished high school the previous year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo other state had a larger amount of students in either group attend out-of-state schools, but California and New York -- two states with significantly larger populations -- weren&rsquo;t far behind.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore than 34,500 students -- nearly 28,300 of whom recently finished high school -- &nbsp;left California for college in fall 2010. In New York, more than 33,900 students left the state for school in fall 2010. Of those students, more than 28,600 were graduated from high school in the previous year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreenwald was comparing the amount of New Jerseyans who leave the state for college to a nationwide figure, but &nbsp;it&rsquo;s worth nothing that as a percentage -- a &quot;more accurate barometer&quot; for comparing states according to Joseph Stetar, a professor of education at Seton Hall University -- four other states send more students out-of-state for college.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA larger percentage of all first-time freshman students in Alaska, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont attended college outside of their home state than New Jersey in fall 2010. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreenwald said &quot;about 100,000 kids in this country leave their home state and go to another state to be educated. Out of that 100,000 young people, 30,000 of them are from New Jersey, by far the largest amount.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoughly 30,000 recent high school graduates left New Jersey to attend an out-of-state college, according to federal data. That part of Greenwald&rsquo;s claim is true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut far more than 100,000 students attend out-of-state schools and though New Jersey students represented the largest portion of that group, California and New York followed closely behind.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we rate this statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/08/lou_greenwald_new_jersey.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-15T11:46:35.893548", "ruling_date": "2012-08-16T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Lou Greenwald claims New Jersey students represent nearly a third of all college freshmen who attend school out of their home state", "ruling_headline_slug": "lou-greenwald-claims-new-jersey-students-represent", "ruling_link_text": "Nationwide numbers are way off", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBlue Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.bluejersey.com/diary/21462/blue-jersey-focus-assembly-majority-leader-lou-greenwald\">Blue Jersey Focus: Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald</a>, Aug. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Brian McGinnis, communications director for <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?leg=155\">Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald</a>, Aug. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/22/susan-cole/state-college-president-claims-new-jersey-experien/\">State college president claims New Jersey experiences a net loss of 30,000 students a year</a>, March 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Center for Education Statistics: Digest of Education Statistics, <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_232.asp\">Residence and migration of all first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in degree-granting institutions, by state or jurisdiction: Fall 2010</a>, accessed Aug. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Center for Education Statistics: Digest of Education Statistics, <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_233.asp\">Residence and migration of all first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in degree-granting institutions who graduated from high school in the previous 12 months, by state or jurisdiction: Fall 2010</a>, accessed Aug. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Center for Education Statistics: Digest of Education Statistics, <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_234.asp\">Residence and migration of all first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in 4-year degree-granting institutions who graduated from high school in the previous 12 months, by state or jurisdiction: Fall 2010</a>, accessed Aug. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://domapp01.shu.edu/depts/uc/apps/libraryrepository.nsf/resourceid/C3EEB9B0BDF342B9852575F4004725B4/$File/McCloud-Alyssa-F_Doctorate.PDF?Open\">Migration Patterns on College Students in New Jersey: A Synthesis of the Data and Literature</a> by Alyssa R.
