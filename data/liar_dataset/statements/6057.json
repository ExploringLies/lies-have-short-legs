That article pointed out, too, that many presidents have gone golfing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur sources for the Obama count included CBS newsman Mark Knoller, who has long tracked each president&rsquo;s outings, and another White House correspondent, Keith Koffler, who has taken to blogging about times that Obama goes golfing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKoffler said in a Dec. 26, 2011,<a href=\"http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2011/12/26/obama-golfs-90th-time-president/\"> blog post</a>: &quot;After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, is Obama approaching 100 rounds of golf? Looks like it. Koffler posted a<a href=\"http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2012/05/26/obama-makes-way-golf-course/\"> blog</a> on May 26, 2012 stating that Obama was going golfing that day for his 98th time as president.
