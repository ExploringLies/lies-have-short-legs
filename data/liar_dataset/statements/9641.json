As for her request for us not to PolitiFact her, well, we couldn&rsquo;t help but take that as a friendly challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Studies about regressive taxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rich told PolitiFact Florida in an interview, &quot;don&rsquo;t hold me to &lsquo;third regressive.&rsquo; .... I did not say &lsquo;third&rsquo; definitively. ... We are one of the most regressive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rich cited a 2013 <a href=\"http://www.itep.org/whopays/\">report</a> by The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which partners with <a href=\"http://ctj.org/about/background.php\">Citizens for Tax Justice</a>, a group that advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report concluded that all states have regressive tax systems. It means that state taxes come more from the poor and middle class than from the rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Virtually every state&rsquo;s tax system is fundamentally unfair, taking a much greater share of income from middle- and low-income families than from wealthy families,&quot; the report says. &quot;The absence of a graduated personal income tax and the over reliance on consumption taxes exacerbate this problem in many states.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report measures property, sales and excise taxes on gasoline and cigarettes paid by different income groups in each state in 2013 and concludes Florida is <a href=\"http://www.itep.org/pdf/fl.pdf\">&quot;No. 2 of the terrible 10&quot;</a> -- the second most-regressive tax system in the country. (No. 1 was <a href=\"http://www.itep.org/pdf/wa.pdf\">Washington state</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The No. 1 and No. 2 predictor of a very unfair tax system is not having a personal income tax of any kind and an above-average sales tax, and Florida has both of those things,&quot; said Matt Gardner, the institute&rsquo;s executive director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report found that for non-elderly taxpayers, the bottom 20 percent pay 13.2 percent of their income toward state and local taxes. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent of earners only pay about 2.3 percent of their income toward state and local taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report gives a nod to one progressive feature of Florida&rsquo;s taxes: We don&rsquo;t have sales taxes on groceries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were unable to find any other entity that included Florida in a state-by-state comparison of regressivity and taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that analyzes tax policy, wrote a <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/comments-who-pays-distributional-analysis-tax-systems-all-50-states\">report</a> criticizing the institute&rsquo;s study, but their points were not specifically about the states&rsquo; rankings. Instead, they criticized the report for promoting income taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation does its own ranking of states in terms of <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/default/files/docs/2014%20State%20Business%20Tax%20Climate%20Index.pdf\">business climate</a> -- Florida placed fifth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We interviewed a few experts on taxes, and they were not surprised by Florida&rsquo;s ranking when it comes to regressive taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not that many states don&rsquo;t have an income tax, so that puts us in a small group that looks more regressive,&quot; said University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith. However, he said, &quot; &lsquo;regressive&rsquo; and &lsquo;burdensome&rsquo; are separate issues. The tax burden in Florida is still very low, despite being regressive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aaron Twait, research director at the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, said there are only two taxes that are progressive: the income tax and the estate tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;States that don&rsquo;t have the income tax -- they just don&rsquo;t have that lever to pull,&quot; he said. &quot;Sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes run from moderately regressive to really regressive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rich said that there is evidence that Florida has &quot;the third most-regressive tax base,&quot; though she acknowledged when she spoke she wasn&rsquo;t certain if she had the number right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was close: A study placed Florida No. 2 in terms of its regressive tax base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida has a regressive tax base because we lack a state income tax. Though the Tax Foundation criticized the report, it didn&rsquo;t dispute the states&rsquo; rankings, and other experts we interviewed also had no qualms about Florida&rsquo;s placement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rich&rsquo;s number of third place was just a smidgen low, so we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-22T16:20:48.019958", "ruling_date": "2014-07-22T17:29:54", "ruling_headline": "Nan Rich says Florida has 3rd most-regressive tax structure", "ruling_headline_slug": "nan-rich-says-florida-has-third-most-regressive-ta", "ruling_link_text": "No state income tax", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, <a href=\"http://www.itep.org/whopays/#map\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Who Pays?&quot;</u></a>, January 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizens for Tax Justice, <a href=\"http://ctj.org/about/background.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Website</u></a>, Accessed July 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, <a href=\"http://fcfep.org/attachments/20131111--Improving%20Fiscal%20Condition%20Allows%20Legislature%20to%20Address%20Budget%20Cuts,%20Fairness.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Improving fiscal condition allows the Legislature to address previous budget cuts and address tax fairness,&quot;</u></a> November 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Foundation, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/comments-who-pays-distributional-analysis-tax-systems-all-50-states\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Comments on Who Pays?
