It&rsquo;s got the worst business climate in the nation. We&rsquo;re a laughing stock. And I want to change that,&quot; Cox, a San Diego businessman, said in the&nbsp;interview conducted Oct. 21, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox cited several of the state&rsquo;s high costs from housing to gas prices. We fact-checked those in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2017/nov/16/claims-abound-californias-highest-nation-costs-not/\">related article</a>. He went on to say, however, that Californians also pay &quot;the highest electricity bills&quot; in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California, the center of the nation&rsquo;s solar industry, is known for both producing and consuming huge amounts of electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But do we also pay the most on our electricity bills?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to shine a light on this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>California has the nation&rsquo;s sixth highest retail price of electricity in the residential sector, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provides independent analysis of energy data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, one might assume with this high cost Californians also pay more than most states on their bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s just the opposite, at least for two key sectors. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s average <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf\">residential monthly electricity bill</a> in 2016 was $95.20, or less expensive than&nbsp;39 other states, according to EIA data. Nationwide, the average bill was $112.59 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the state&rsquo;s average <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_c.pdf\">industrial monthly electricity bill</a> was $3,408, or 42nd in the nation. That was about half the national average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s average <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_b.pdf\">commercial monthly electricity bill</a> was $866, or fifth highest in the nation, much closer to the top, but by no means &quot;the highest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California has some of the highest rates, but they also have some of the lowest consumption per customer, so they have lower bills than most states,&quot; said Marc Hanish, an EIA expert on state electricity profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, California ranks <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=CA\">49th in the nation</a> in per capita electricity consumption. Hanish said that&rsquo;s driven both by high prices and by the state&rsquo;s strong commitment to energy efficient buildings and appliances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox&rsquo;s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed California has &quot;the highest electricity bills&quot; in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=CA\">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a> shows California&rsquo;s average monthly electricity bills in 2016 ranked far below the national average, particularly in the residential and industrial sectors. They were 40th and 42nd, respectively. The state&rsquo;s average monthly commercial electricity bills were more expensive, at fifth highest, though still not &quot;the highest&quot; as Cox claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s electricity prices are more expensive than in many states. Customers in the state, however, consume far less electricity than the national average, which drives down the cost of bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if Cox had claimed California had the highest electricity rates, he would still be off the mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox&rsquo;s campaign offered no evidence to back up his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-16T13:52:55.613079", "ruling_date": "2017-11-16T11:19:47", "ruling_headline": "Do Californians pay the \u2018highest electricity bills\u2019 in the nation?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-california-have-highest-electricity-bills-nat", "ruling_link_text": "Residential, industrial bills among lowest", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Capital Public Radio, <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/news/insight/2017/11/03/insight-110317a/\">Interview with Jon Cox</a>, Nov. 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marc Hanish, expert on state electricity profiles, U.S. Energy Information Agency, interview Nov. 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Energy Information Agency, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf\">2016 Average Monthly Bill - Residential</a>, accessed November 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Energy Information Agency, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_b.pdf\">2016 Average Monthly Bill - Commercial</a>, accessed November 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Energy Information Agency, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_c.pdf\">2016 Average Monthly Bill - Industrial</a>, accessed November 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electricity Local, <a href=\"https://www.electricitylocal.com/states/california/\">California Electricity Rates &amp;
