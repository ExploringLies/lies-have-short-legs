Jones said emails show Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and billionaire investor George Soros instigated and orchestrated racial protests in Charlottesville by trying to &quot;control&quot; and keep people &quot;desperate.&quot; After an exhaustive examination of relevant leaked emails, it found no evidence of Jones&rsquo; theory and rated it Pants On Fire, the most severe false rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See the full fact check <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/alex-jones/infowars-alex-jones-falsely-says-george-soros-hill/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The violence in Charlottesville culminated with the death of Heather D. Heyer, 32. She was killed and at least 19 others were injured after the driver of a Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of people protesting the rally. Authorities charged a 20-year-old man from Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/us/james-alex-fields-charlottesville-driver-.html\">James A. Fields Jr.</a>, with second-degree murder. Fields had marched in the white nationalist rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rohrabacher, a 15-term congressman and former speechwriter for President Reagan, has garnered controversy in recent months for his pro-Russia stance amid intelligence findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats have targeted his congressional seat in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rohrabacher&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are Rohrabacher&rsquo;s conspiracy theory comments made in a <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> <a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/The-pro-Russia-pro-weed-pro-Assange-GOP-12195944.php\">article</a> on Sept. 14, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article says Rohrabacher is &quot;deep&quot; into the theory that &quot;Democrats were behind last month&rsquo;s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Under Rohrabacher&rsquo;s scenario, a former &quot;Hillary and Bernie supporter&quot; got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E.
