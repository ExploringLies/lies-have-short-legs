This season it was red tape involving his 8-month-old son, J.B., also known to Axford&rsquo;s Twitter followers as &quot;Little Ax.&quot; The boy was born in Milwaukee, and is a U.S. citizen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe elder Axford, however, is a Canadian. And his trip to Arizona was delayed because he didn&rsquo;t have a passport for the baby when he was planning to fly from Canada into the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis Twitter followers (@JohnAxford) got a play-by-play of his travel travails.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the offerings: &quot;Thank you Homeland Security for not letting my AMERICAN son into AMERICA!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%233YearValentinesCurse\"> #3YearValentinesCurse</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23WontBeSeeingYouTodayWarmWeatherInPhoenix\"> #</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23WontBeSeeingYouTodayWarmWeatherInPhoenix\">WontBeSeeingYouTodayWarmWeatherInPhoenix</a>&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe was more expansive in an interview with the Journal Sentinel, which is what prompted us to turn our version of the radar gun -- the Truth-O-Meter -- on Axford.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Homeland Security requires passports for every age, no matter what,&quot; Axford said in the interview. &quot;You can arrive by land or sea if you&#39;re under the age of 15 with a birth certificate, but if you go by air Homeland Security requires passports for everybody, no matter what the age.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs he right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPassports only by air, though birth certificates suffice by car or boat?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, it&rsquo;s true Axford is a sports figure. But his statement touches squarely on U.S. policy. So we checked with the State Department, Homeland Security, border control and several federal government websites.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurns out the rules are different for border-crossing babies, depending on the mode of travel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you&rsquo;re traveling by air, you need a passport. Period. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd, yes, you have to get a photograph of the kid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA kid passport costs $105. However, if you&rsquo;re coming by land -- such as the border crossing in Detroit -- the rules are less strict, and less expensive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;U.S. children ages 15 and under arriving by land or sea from a contiguous territory may present an original or copy of his or her birth certificate (issued by the Vital Records Department in the state where he or she was born), a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or a Naturalization Certificate. &nbsp;If the child is a newborn and the actual birth certificate has not arrived from the Vital Records Department, we will accept a Hospital issued birth certificate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEach year, the federal government issues about 450,000 passports to infants, a spokeswoman for the State Department said in an email. The department even provides helpful hints for <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotoreq/pptphotoreq_5333.html\">how to take a passport picture</a> of your little one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKiddie passports are valid for five years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the end, Axford got to spring training the hard way, again. His father drove the family across the border to Detroit and they caught a flight from there to Arizona.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur conclusion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAxford&rsquo;s trip back to the mound took a detour. He said it was because of travel delays and said federal law required his baby to have a passport to fly back into the country. He learned a valuable lesson about border crossing: The feds are always right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Axford&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-23T21:59:21.697649", "ruling_date": "2012-03-02T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Milwaukee Brewers pitcher John Axford says even babies need a passport to enter the U.S. by air", "ruling_headline_slug": "milwaukee-brewers-pitcher-john-axford-says-even-ba", "ruling_link_text": "Right across the plate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. State Department <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/minors/minors_834.html\">Passport information site</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/minors/minors_834.html\">United States State Department Travel information for minors</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/sports/brewers/passport-snag-provides-bumpy-trip-for-axford-ts48qmn-139668923.html\">&quot;Passport snag provides bumpy trip for Axford,&quot; </a>Feb. 19, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Customs and Border Protection <a href=\"https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/74/session/L3NpZC9LN0I2TWZSaw%3D%3D\">website on passports</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails, Elizabeth A.
