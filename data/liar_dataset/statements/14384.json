Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post said that Clinton would be &quot;held accountable for the many wrongdoings she has been charged with,&quot; although it never specifies what those charges may be. It said President Donald Trump had tasked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Clinton&rsquo;s ties to Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s where the &quot;key witness&quot; comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Glenn Simpson has been friends with the Clinton family for many years,&quot; the post read. &quot;Not coincidentally, he is also a co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS that disseminated the widely debunked fake news dossier containing over-the-top stories about Donald Trump going to Russian hotels.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CoffeeBreakForYou.com article said the Senate Judiciary Committee had subpoenaed Simpson. The post asked readers whether they thought Simpson &quot;will share crucial information about how Hillary attempted to frame Donald Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story <a href=\"http://conservative101.com/breaking-witness-will-testify-hillary-clinton/\">appears to have originated</a> as a July 30 post on Conservative101.com. The byline on the post was Christopher Reynolds. We attempted to reach Conservative101.com through the website&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://conservative101.com/contact-us/\">contact form</a> (the only method of contact available) but didn&rsquo;t get a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story isn&#39;t fake in the sense that it makes up all its content, but it does spin things to the point of being misleading or incorrect.&nbsp;The most notable issues are whether&nbsp;Clinton is really being investigated, and for what reasons the Senate Judiciary Committee wants to talk to Simpson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/25/trump-attacks-jeff-sessions-failing-investigate-hillary-clinton/507568001/\">publicly criticized Sessions</a> for failing to investigate Clinton for deleting emails from her private server and for allegedly getting information from Ukraine during her presidential campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Justice Department has not publicly acknowledged an investigation into Clinton, although the Senate Judiciary Committee has demanded the agency disclose if it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article164608707.html\">investigating the Ukrainian allegations</a>. The Justice Department has until Aug. 3 to respond. House Republicans have requested FBI documents into the campaign investigation and have asked for a special counsel for a Clinton probe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate committee has been looking into the extent of Russian influence on the 2016 election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simpson is a real person. He is a former journalist who is a founding partner of opposition research firm Fusion GPS. Simpson was initially being <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/343242-senate-panel-subpoenas-co-founder-of-firm-tied-to-controversial\">subpoenaed for a hearing</a>, but not explicitly to expose Clinton. The committee wanted to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/21/donald-trump-jr-paul-manafort-chuck-grassley-testify-russia-240815\">compel him to discuss details</a> of his company&rsquo;s Trump dossier, which became public in January 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simpson wanted to protect the Democratic-leaning client who hired Fusion GPS to create the Trump dossier, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-russia-mess-sucks-in-democrats-too\">according to the Daily Beast</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simpson had originally intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, but struck a deal in which he would <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/25/glenn-simpson-senate-judiciary-testimony-240932\">provide a transcribed interview</a>. The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed and <a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=470E18BA-E7C0-4EEA-9471-D2B5888BCF68\">withdrew its subpoena</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any proof that Simpson was &quot;friends with the Clinton family,&quot; although the <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2017/06/24/inside-the-shadowy-intelligence-firm-behind-the-trump-dossier/\"><em>New York Post </em>reported that</a> Fusion GPS was &quot;actually an opposition-research group for Democrats, and the founders, who are more political activists than journalists, have a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But trying to protect the identity of a Clinton ally who paid for opposition research against Trump is not the same as testifying against Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the Trump opposition report, Fusion GPS <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/26/russia-probe-democrats-block-key-witness-against-shadowy-firm-fusion-gps.html\">also had reportedly worked</a> to <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/21/fusion-refusal-co-founder-firm-behind-trump-russia-dossier-to-plead-fifth.html\">ease sanctions against Russia</a>, through ties with <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fusion-gps-trump-russia-dossier-bill-browder-2017-7\">Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya</a>.
