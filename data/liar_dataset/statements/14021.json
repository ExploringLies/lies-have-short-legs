We&rsquo;re going to bring it back, and we&rsquo;re going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,&quot; he&rsquo;s quoted.

Glass was a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1998/09/bissinger199809\">notorious fabricator of scads of people and quotes</a> in stories he wrote for <em>The New Republic</em>. He was exposed back in 1998, before we used the trendy term &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also clear from the other stories on the site that the news is fake.
