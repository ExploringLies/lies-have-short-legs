Mattie Munoz, a spokeswoman for the labor secretary, said the information comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which which tracks the earnings of union and nonunion workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bureau examines &quot;median&quot; earnings - the halfway point at which 50 percent of workers make less and 50 percent of workers earn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, the median weekly earnings for people who are a member of a union was $980, according to the bureau&rsquo;s most <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t02.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>current figures</u></a>. For nonunion members, the median weekly pay was $776. That&rsquo;s a $204 difference and in line with Perez&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, told our colleagues at PolitiFact National in a 2014 <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/07/thomas-perez/labor-secretary-thomas-perez-says-union-members-ea/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>story</u></a> that unions typically do a better job of raising wages for workers with less-than-average education than they do for those with higher levels of education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone who has a doctoral degree, for example, probably wouldn&rsquo;t get as much of a pay bump from being in a union, but they might have better job security as well as better health and retirement benefits than their nonunion colleagues, Burtless said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t04.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>table</u></a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which further breaks down the pay disparity among specific occupations, shows that unionized workers in some professions earn less than their nonunion colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the architecture and engineering fields, for example, workers in a union last year had a median weekly pay of $1,393, but that was outpaced by nonunion workers who earned $1,427 each week. Federal employees who are in a union earn a median weekly pay of $1,058, while those not in a union earn more: $1,159 each week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for other government employees, the story is different, with unions typically leading to larger paychecks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the country, state employees in a union earned a $988 median weekly salary, while nonunion workers earned a median $867. Unionized local government workers earned a median weekly salary of $1,043, compared with nonunion local government employees who earned $783 a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Perez has made this claim, although he&rsquo;s changed the wording.

That was rated Mostly True, since the figures involved instead are a tally of the &quot;median&quot; weekly pay rather than &quot;average&quot; pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez said that a union member&rsquo;s median weekly income is about $200 more than someone who is not in a union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His figure, on the whole, holds up, although there are some professions that are exceptions. But Perez clearly was talking in general terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we rate his statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-28T23:52:51.380694", "ruling_date": "2016-06-29T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tom Perez says union members earn median $200 a week more than nonunion workers", "ruling_headline_slug": "tom-perez-says-union-members-earn-median-200-week-", "ruling_link_text": "But not with all professions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Comments by Labor Secretary Thomas Perez to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Mattie Munoz, press secretary for Thomas Perez, June 22, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Union members summary,&quot;</u></a> Jan. 28, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t04.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Table 4.
