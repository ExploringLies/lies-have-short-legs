He&rsquo;s running against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich and, on the Republican side, tea partier Joe Miller and Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. We decided to sort this out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Stand your ground&quot; was first introduced in the Alaska Legislature in 2010. At the time, Sullivan served as the state&rsquo;s attorney general, heading an office that reviews every law moving through the Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original &quot;stand your ground&quot; bill failed to pass. A second iteration of the bill appeared and failed in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sullivan left the attorney general&rsquo;s office to become the commissioner of natural resources at the end of 2010 -- long before a final version of the bill passed in 2013. So even though &quot;stand your ground&quot; first appeared in the Alaska Legislature when Sullivan was in a position to put his support behind it, it wasn&rsquo;t successful until he had moved on to other positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We came across one indication of Sullivan and the attorney general office&rsquo;s position on &quot;stand your ground,&quot; but it doesn&rsquo;t help his case. His office sent a <a href=\"http://www.alaskapublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HB-381-LAW-LETTER.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>letter</u></a> in March 2010 that attacks the heart of &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter uses strong language and primarily takes issue with the fact that the law would remove the then-existing &quot;duty to retreat.&quot; &quot;Duty to retreat&quot; means that if a person believes that they are in imminent danger of death or severe bodily harm, but there is a safe way for them to get away, they are expected to retreat without assaulting or killing the person threatening them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whatever source one thinks our laws should be drawn from -- the 10 commandments which say &#39;thou shalt not kill,&#39; simple morality, utilitarianism principles of the greater good or simply the concept that life is sacred -- this bill would encourage the needless taking of human life,&quot; the letter reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the letter seems to make Sullivan&rsquo;s position fairly clear, he now has a twofold defense:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, his campaign says the letter took issue with the bill&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.sullivan2014.com/standwithdan_standyourground\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>complexity</u></a>, rather than &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in general. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we read the letter, we found that nearly half of it criticized the bill for nearly eliminating the duty to retreat -- contradicting the core of &quot;stand your ground,&quot; according to some experts. &quot;Duty to retreat&quot; and &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws cannot coexist, as the names suggest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Someone who opposes a self-defense statute that provides that there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;duty to retreat&rsquo; is also against a typical &lsquo;stand your ground&rsquo; statute,&quot; said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, we also found that the letter brings up problems with specific language and lack of clarity, and it never says outright that the Legislature should abandon its efforts to pass &quot;stand your ground.&quot; But it does say that the bill &quot;would promote violence and be a bad idea for (Alaska).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEcq1zwqRkY&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sullivan says</u></a> he did not pen or approve of the letter even though his name is included in the signature. (A then-assistant attorney general John Skidmore wrote it.) Sullivan&rsquo;s name was included on any piece of paper that left his office -- even if he didn&rsquo;t see it first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are nearly 200 assistant attorneys general, and a lot of legislation passes through that office, so it is conceivable that he wasn&rsquo;t aware that the letter was going out, said Cori Mills, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Skidmore wasn&rsquo;t the only assistant attorney general who had problems with the bill. About two weeks later -- after some tweaks had been made in response to the letter -- three other assistant attorney generals (all from different divisions) <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.ak.us/pdf/26/M/HJUD2010-03-291309.PDF\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>gave similar complaints</u></a> on behalf of the Department of Law at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The updated version made &quot;a bad bill better,&quot; said then-Assistant Attorney General Anne Carpeneti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Sullivan&rsquo;s campaign to point to any public statement showing his support for the law. They could only provide <a href=\"http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/sullivan2014/pages/254/attachments/original/1401999049/Letter_to_constituents_on_Stand_your_Ground_Legislation.pdf?1401999049\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>this letter</u></a> from state Rep.
