For example, some states included private school students who received public funding. That&#39;s why a uniform system was adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last time the rates were close to being this high was for the class that graduated in 1970, when the Education Department pegged the rate at 78.7 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet because the current method for calculating rates is only 5 years old, it&#39;s not clear that the 1970 rate, or even the subsequent ones, are comparable to current rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the mid 1970s until around 2008, according to data from <a href=\"http://blog.centerforpubliceducation.org/2014/02/20/high-school-graduation-rate-at-an-all-time-high/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the National Center for Education Statistics</u></a>, the annual rates consistently stayed at 75 percent or below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the new system, begun with the 2010-11 school year, rates were calculated to be 79 percent once again and have since been rising, albeit slowly. It was 80 percent for 2011-12, 81.4 percent for 2012-13, and 82.3 percent for 2013-14, the most recent rate available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when we checked this statistic<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-high-schoolers-are-graduating-al/\"> two years ago</a>, there was a consensus in the education community that graduation rates were rising. But uncertainty persists about those old rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Obama had restricted his time frame to the past four years, the numbers would be on firmer ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he didn&#39;t. He gave the impression that these were the highest rates ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Obama&#39;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-12T23:08:27.006567", "ruling_date": "2016-01-13T00:10:32", "ruling_headline": "High school graduation rates are at 'new highs,' says Obama in State of the Union", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-high-school-graduation-rates-are", "ruling_link_text": "Uncertainties persist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Medium, &quot;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/president-obama-s-2016-state-of-the-union-address-7c06300f9726#.h195guupf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>President Obama&#39;s 2016 State of the Union Address</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Education, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-high-school-graduation-rate-hits-new-record-high-0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. High School Graduation Rate Hits New Record High</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 15, 2015, accessed Jan. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-high-schoolers-are-graduating-al/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Barack Obama says high schoolers are graduating at an all-time high</u></a>,&quot; March 26, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Public Education, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.centerforpubliceducation.org/2014/02/20/high-school-graduation-rate-at-an-all-time-high/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>High school graduation rate at an all-time high</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 20, 2014, accessed Jan. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Center for Education Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_coi.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Public High School Graduation Rates</u></a>,&quot; May 2015, accessed Jan. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>We&#39;ve &quot;lifted high school graduation rates to new highs.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a State of the Union speech", "statement_date": "2016-01-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
