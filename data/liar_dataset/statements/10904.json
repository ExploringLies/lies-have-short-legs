Huckabee called the idea political and economic suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sixty million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income&quot; he said. &quot;The government took that money from you involuntarily when you started working &ndash; with the promise that you&rsquo;d get that money back when you retire. For the government to even think about breaking that promise is absolutely ridiculous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huckabee&rsquo;s numbers intrigued us. We reached out to his campaign but did not hear back, so we delved into the statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual number of people who receive benefits is slightly higher than what Huckabee said at <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">64 million</a>. The majority of recipients, about 43 million, are over age 65&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get to this group later. Of the remaining beneficiaries, in 2013, Social Security constituted at least half of the income for 61 percent of disabled recipients and for 44 percent of non-disabled beneficiaries (survivors of deceased workers and early retirees), according to a Social Security Administration spokeswoman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2014/fast_facts14.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">latest data</a> from the Social Security Administration show that Huckabee got the second number right, if we assume by &quot;seniors&quot; he meant those over age 65.

In 2008, the estimate for Social Security&rsquo;s slice of the total income pie was 20 percentage points more than what tax filings showed, <a href=\"http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jor.2014.1.3.014?journalCode=jor\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">according to a study in the Journal of Retirement.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Huckabee is probably technically not correct since the numbers he relies on are flawed, though he&rsquo;d have no real reason to know this, &quot; said Andrew Biggs, who used to run the SSA&rsquo;s policy office during the George W. Bush administration and now researches Social Security reform at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Biggs has <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304603704579329012635470796\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">written</a> <a href=\"http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/is-there-a-retirement-crisis\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">extensively</a> on this topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the catch to the catch: Half of Americans don&rsquo;t have retirement savings at all, according to the GAO. This means that estimates for the people who rely the most on Social Security (low- and middle-income households) may only be marginally off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Huckabee is correct, experts agree, in his point that many Americans rely heavily on Social Security (too heavily, to the point that middle- and upper-income families are not saving enough on their own, said Biggs). Most people who receive Social Security need the safety net, said Melissa Favreault, an expert on retirement and social programs at The Urban Institute, a public policy think tank. For many recipients, it&rsquo;s &quot;absolutely vital income,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AARP spokesperson David Bruns told us the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are very substantial number of people who are disproportionatelyfemale, disproportionatelyminority, disproportionatelyblue collar, for whom Social Security is critical,&quot; he said. &quot;I&rsquo;ve run the math for myself: 40 percent of our retirement income will come from Social Security and I have a government pension. My wife and I have saved as hard as we can for all of our lives. We are not the only ones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huckabee said, &quot;60 million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huckabee&rsquo;s numbers reflect official statistics, though slightly lowballed: About 64 million Americans receive Social Security benefits and about 36 percent of seniors depend on it for 90 percent of their income, according to the Social Security Administration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some take issue with those statistics, saying they understate the importance of irregular sources of income and therefore may overstate the importance of Social Security. However, experts agree with the gist of Huckabee&rsquo;s idea: Broadly speaking, Social Security beneficiaries need the cash to make ends meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-04T13:46:27.945158", "ruling_date": "2015-06-04T14:49:21", "ruling_headline": "Mike Huckabee says one-third of seniors depend on Social Security for 90% of income", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-huckabee-says-one-third-seniors-depend-social", "ruling_link_text": "Methodology has issues, but it's in the ballpark", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Nicole Tiggemann, spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, June 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/scholar/andrew-g-biggs/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Andrew Biggs</a>, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, June 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/author/melissa-m-favreault\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Melissa Favreault</a>, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, June 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Dave Bruns, communications manager at the <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">AARP</a>, June 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4539830/mike-huckabee-speech-florida-economic-growth-summit\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Mike Huckabee speech from Florida Economic Growth Summit</a>, June 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/jeb-bush-on-immigration-reform-social-security/Jeb%20Bush%20on%20immigration%20reform,%20Social%20Security\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Jeb Bush on immigration reform, Social Security</a>, May 31, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social Security Administration, <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/stat_snapshot/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Monthly Statistical Snapshot, April 2015</a>, May 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social Security Administration, <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/income_pop55/2012/sect08.html#table8.a1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Importance of Income Sources Relative to Total Income</a>, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IB_14-19-508.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Do Census Data Understate Retirement Income?</a>, Dec. 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/670153.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">RETIREMENT SECURITY</a>, May 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Journal of Retirement, <a href=\"http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jor.2014.1.3.014?journalCode=jor\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Contribution of Pension and Retirement Savings to Retirement Income Security: More Than Meets the Eye</a>, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wall Street Journal,</em> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304603704579329012635470796\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Biggs and Schieber: Retirees Aren&#39;t Headed for the Poor House</a>, Jan. 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/is-there-a-retirement-crisis\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Is There a Retirement Crisis?</a>, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "author", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 9, "home_state": "Arkansas", "id": 16, "last_name": "Huckabee", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "mike-huckabee", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Mike_Huckabee.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/16/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 8, "website": "http://www.explorehuckabee.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Sixty million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at Gov.
