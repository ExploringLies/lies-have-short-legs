Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting,&quot; Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that correct? We took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We located a <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/05/declining%20business%20dynamism%20litan/declining_business_dynamism_hathaway_litan.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>May 2014 report</u></a> by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, &quot;Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubio&rsquo;s claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time,&quot; they wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. &quot;The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing,&quot; the authors wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker from the report: &quot;Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data,&quot; the authors wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a graph showing the trend line:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BL7HEmQPQejHZD1BhPN7ESu0ffdukMO0-Q-gzuhMJaOw8ykxdoRF4SByvadt7Ly3smHDfw_DTq5YuUul9K4Bk-F8gfSHPV7GPKzN4ClWKOGK9UUswd77zEu6bIQQvQPykQtB26w\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:437px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" />Technically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so it&rsquo;s not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasn&rsquo;t twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubio&rsquo;s claim is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s true,&quot; Litan told PolitiFact, adding, &quot;We haven&rsquo;t reversed this yet.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, &quot;it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy --&nbsp;whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said that &quot;for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting.&quot; The change didn&rsquo;t happen in the past year or two -- it occurred in 2008 -- but in general, Rubio has accurately cited a statistic from a respected think tank&rsquo;s report. The co-author of that report said he feels Rubio has stated the claim accurately. We rate Rubio&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-02T12:45:59.395689", "ruling_date": "2015-06-02T13:37:13", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio says for first time in 35 years, 'we have more businesses dying than we do starting'", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-says-first-time-35-years-we-have-more-", "ruling_link_text": "Respected think tank report backs it up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Marco Rubio, comments in Orlando, Fla., June 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brookings Institution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/05/declining%20business%20dynamism%20litan/declining_business_dynamism_hathaway_litan.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros</u></a>,&quot; May 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/24/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-small-business-are-going-out-business-rec/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ted Cruz: Small business are going out of business &#39;in record numbers,</u></a>&#39; &quot; March 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Robert Litan, nonresident senior fellow in the Brookings Institution&rsquo;s economic studies program, June 2, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 36, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Marco", "half_true_count": 33, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 277, "last_name": "Rubio", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "marco-rubio", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Marco_Rubio.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/277/", "total_count": 168, "true_count": 20, "website": "http://www.rubio.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech in Orlando, Fla.", "statement_date": "2015-06-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 140, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/140/", "subject": "Small Business", "subject_slug": "small-business", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
