In his very first budget, Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since. In fact, property taxes are up more than 20 percent and fees have doubled.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe website is a detailed complement to an RGA <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOvMl3UcuPE&amp;feature=player_embedded\">TV ad</a> on Barrett -- the ad featuring an elevator going down. (We&rsquo;re working on several claims from that ad, which also goes after Democrat Kathleen Falk, also running in the all-but-certain recall election against Walker).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett, in addition to running in the Walker recall race, was re-elected as Milwaukee mayor on April 3, 2012 against underfunded candidate Edward McDonald.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo one disputes that total tax levy collections rose during Barrett&rsquo;s two terms, and the RGA gets the numbers roughly right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we were interested in whether Barrett broke an old campaign promise on taxes, and has raised taxes and fees every year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the campaign promise, an RGA spokesman pointed us to an <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V7oaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dUUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1664%2C4881378\">Aug. 7, 2003 Journal Sentinel article</a> on a candidate forum from Barrett&rsquo;s first bid for mayor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As mayor, I will not raise property taxes,&quot; Barrett said at the forum.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found a similarly forceful pledge in the paper&rsquo;s coverage of another forum on <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/RGA.doc\">August 23, 2003</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m not going to raise property taxes,&quot; Barrett said at that one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tax levy has grown 25 percent under Barrett, from 2005 to 2012, according to <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/User/crystali/PublicSite/TXHSTCPI1.pdf\">official city figures</a> on tax changes under Barrett.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCase closed?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo. There&rsquo;s more to this story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter both Barrett quotes, the stories immediately noted Barrett had made clear his pledge was to freeze the tax rate, not the overall tax levy -- the total amount collected from all city taxpayers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what happened to the rate? The rate actually went down 5.5% in Barrett&rsquo;s first budget -- the &quot;very first budget&quot; the RGA website refers to.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, its not an especially impressive feat -- rising property assessments meant the rate could go down even if more money was collected in taxes. What&rsquo;s more, those same rising property values meant many homeowners faced a higher out-of-pocket bill despite the lower rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that was the pledge Barrett made.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe RGA website also says Barrett broke his pledge to &quot;keep a lid on&quot; property taxes in his first budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s another line right out of the 2003-&rsquo;04 campaign. It came later in the race, when Barrett, under pressure to toughen up his tax pledge, said he would impose a virtual freeze in the overall tax levy in his first budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Pledges to keep lid on amount collected from property tax,&quot; the Journal Sentinel said of Barrett in a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/RGA.doc\">Nov. 12, 2003 issues story</a>. &quot;Would allow increase in first budget, for 2005, to account for increased tax base from new construction. Would review this pledge on &lsquo;a year-by-year basis.&rsquo; Not considering any fee increases.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Barrett made the same &quot;freeze&quot; proposal that state legislative Republicans championed at the time -- allowing only for tax increases to cover the new growth in a community.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow did Barrett do on that second pledge, which was only for one year?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe proposed a 1.99 percent levy increase for 2005, compared with new construction growth of 2.175 percent. He did not renew his tax pledge for his next budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the record, in subsequent years, Barrett signed budgets that raised the levy by 5.0 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 4.3 percent, 4.1 percent, 0 percent and 0.5 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rest of the RGA claim is that Barrett has continued increasing taxes and fees &quot;ever since&quot; that first budget in 2005.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat does that mean? One way to hear the statement is an allegation that both fees and taxes went up every year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother is that taxes or fees -- one or the other, not both -- went up every year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEither way, there are problems with that part of the RGA claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s clear that both taxes and fees have not both gone up every year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/103590454.html\">2011 budget</a> -- presented as he ran against Walker -- actually cut the tax levy a tiny amount. It was the only time he had done so in his eight years. Indeed, the RGA&rsquo;s own TV ad says: &quot;Taxes went up every year but one.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCollections from major fees usually went up, year to year under Barrett from 2005 to 2012, but they went down twice compared with the previous year, city records show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2011 fees didn&rsquo;t go up, so that year neither taxes nor fees went up. This is based on the collective take from the city&rsquo;s major property-related fees, including fees for solid waste, snow and ice removal, stormwater and sewer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s worth noting that if you define fees much more broadly -- as every service charge city departments collect -- fees in fact have gone up every year on Barrett&rsquo;s watch, as his budget documents note.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd even in 2011, when fees against residential property owners fell overall, one fee, for stormwater, went up. An owner of a one-to-four unit residential property saw an increase per quarter in that fee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the city, fees are a stand-in for property taxes, we noted in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/barack-obama/obama-says-tom-barrett-has-held-line-property-taxe/\">September 2010 item</a>. We reported that revenue from major fees had more than doubled under Barrett. A new fee -- the stormwater management charge -- went into effect under Barrett.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican Governors Association said, &quot;In his very first budget, (Milwaukee) Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group is wrong on Barrett&rsquo;s first budget, no matter which of Barrett&rsquo;s promises you consider. But there&rsquo;s an element of truth in the part of the claim alleging continual fee and tax increases, depending on how you define fees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the RGA statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-04T12:19:53.526236", "ruling_date": "2012-04-05T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Republican Governors Association says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett raises taxes and fees every year", "ruling_headline_slug": "republican-governors-association-says-milwaukee-ma", "ruling_link_text": "History shows otherwise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRight Direction Wisconsin PAC, <a href=\"http://highertaxesfewerjobs.com/tom-barrett/\">&quot;Higher Taxes, Fewer Jobs&quot; website</a>, accessed March 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRight Direction Wisconsin PAC, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOvMl3UcuPE&amp;feature=player_embedded\">TV ad</a>, March 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Department of Revenue, <a href=\"https://ww2.revenue.wi.gov/EqValue2/application\">database of new construction values</a>, accessed March 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCity of Milwaukee, <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/User/crystali/PublicSite/TXHSTCPI1.pdf\">Budget office archive</a> of historical tax levies, tax rates and budgets, accessed March 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJournal Sentinel archives<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Mike Schrimpf, Republican Governors Association spokesman, March 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCity budget, <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/User/crystali/2010budget/2011budget/2011adopted/2011adoptedbudgetbook.pdf\">2011</a>, fees and taxes, accessed March 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with Mark Nicolini, city budget director, March 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Dennis Yaccarino, city of Milwaukee economist, March 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 321, "last_name": "Republican Governors Association", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "republican-governors-association", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GOP_elephant.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/321/", "total_count": 20, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.rga.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;In his very first budget, (Milwaukee) Mayor Tom Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a website alert", "statement_date": "2012-03-22", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 196, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/196/", "subject": "City Budget", "subject_slug": "city-budget", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Mayor of Milwaukee", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Tom", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 641, "last_name": "Barrett", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "tom-barrett", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Barrett_Tom_PFACT_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/641/", "total_count": 26, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.barrettforwisconsin.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
