We wanted to look into the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article cites a message leaked by <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18328#efmADMAFf\">Wikileaks</a> from when Clinton was secretary of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming that &lsquo;the best way to help Israel deal with Iran&rsquo;s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Clinton did not write the message in the email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The message is a 2012 <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18361\">forwarded document</a> from former diplomat James P. Rubin offering guidance on handling the situation in Syria. Clinton forwarded the message to an aide, asking him to print it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18361\">email</a> to Clinton says she may not agree with his proposal, in which he argues that a more aggressive policy on Syria would eliminate the pressure on Israel to become involved, sparking a larger war in the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s actual policy proposals called for the establishment of a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-exclusive/exclusive-trump-says-clinton-policy-on-syria-would-lead-to-world-war-three-idUSKCN12P2PZ\">no-fly zone and &quot;safe zones&quot; </a>on the ground for Syrian nationals. Her stance on Syria also included more <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/143416/trumps-syria-policy-remind-someone\">airstrikes</a> against the Islamic State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another piece of information that was left out of the article was the conclusion of the document. Rubin said taking stronger action in Syria could protect other civilians from the war raged by President Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s regime. Israel&rsquo;s hesitance to act was noted as a secondary victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email attributed to Clinton in the Your News Wire story were not written by Clinton.
