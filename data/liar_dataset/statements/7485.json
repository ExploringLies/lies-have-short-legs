John Kasich&rsquo;s proposed tax overhaul would affect the pocketbooks of all Ohioans &ndash; whether for good or for ill is a source of disagreement among state lawmakers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican governor&rsquo;s plan aims to reduce income taxes for all Ohioans by 20 percent, shave down sales tax to 5 percent while broadening the sales-tax base to include previously tax-exempt services, and slash in half taxes on most small-business income. Kasich also wants to reform oil and gas severance taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tax plan is drummed up by Kasich&rsquo;s administration as a victory for all Ohio taxpayers. But Rep. Dan Ramos, a Lorain Democrat, is among those who liken the budget proposal to a shell game only Ohio&rsquo;s upper crust can win.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Under [Kasich&rsquo;s] plan, the top one percent in Ohio will pay $10,000 less in income tax each year, but Ohio&rsquo;s working and middle class families will pay more,&quot; Ramos said Feb. 19 in a written statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio decided to audit the representative&rsquo;s numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRamos&rsquo; office said the assertion draws from a study released by left-leaning think tank Policy Matters Ohio, which cites calculations by the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers released in February by ITEP show that the top one percent of Ohio taxpayers, with a mean income above $335,000, would save an average of $10,369 each year. Ohioans earning less than $18,000 would, on average, pay an additional $63 in taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tITEP further asserts that Kasich&rsquo;s proposed tax reform would typically result in a net loss for Ohioans making up to $51,000 each year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut how did ITEP get its numbers?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe non-profit said it uses an elaborate microsimulation tax model that calculates the impact of changes to current tax law at the federal and state level. &nbsp;Among the stratified data used in the model are a large sample of federal tax returns, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys and Census Bureau American Community Surveys, they said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe New York Times has lauded the credibility of the model and Bloomberg has used the model&rsquo;s calculations as reporting tools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor Ohio, ITEP factored Kasich&rsquo;s proposed tax revamps &ndash; minus his severance tax plan &ndash; into its calculations and delivered its findings to Policy Matters Ohio.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s where Ramos picked up the figures and used them in his argument that Kasich&rsquo;s plan would &quot;shift the burden of taxes from the shoulders of those who have to the shoulders of those who have not.&quot; And Ramos is mostly correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers are credible, but Ramos&rsquo;s statement implies that every working and middle-class family would pay more under the reform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the ITEP numbers, 20 percent of Ohioans earn between $51,000 and $78,000 per year, and would begin to see an average yearly savings of about $75. The line between middle- and upper-class incomes is up for debate &ndash; not one to be defined absolutely by PolitiFact Ohio &ndash; but it&rsquo;s safe to say that a yearly income of $51,000 is a far cry from upper-class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRamos was correct in describing the tax benefit to Ohioans with the highest incomes, but he wrongly implied that all working and middle-class families would take a hit under Kasich&rsquo;s plan. For that, we rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-07T15:18:14.320490", "ruling_date": "2013-03-07T15:16:27", "ruling_headline": "State Rep.
