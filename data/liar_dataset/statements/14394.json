Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article called Clinton the &quot;Butcher of Benghazi&quot; and quoted Dr. Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York as saying, &quot;We predict she&rsquo;ll be at rest within hours.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story further said daughter Chelsea was visiting, but husband and former President Bill Clinton was &quot;sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been no other reports of Hillary Clinton suffering a massive coronary episode;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s because she hasn&rsquo;t. The story is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo ostensibly of a doctor feverishly working to save Clinton&rsquo;s life is actually a stock photo we most recently found on a <em>Seattle Times</em> story <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/nwshowcase/careers/what-it-takes-to-be-a-trauma-nurse-in-seattle/\">about the challenges facing trauma nurses</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s not even a Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as far as we can tell.

OurLandOfTheFree.com, a related website, wrote on July 13 that Clinton <a href=\"http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/07/coroners-report-hillary-clintons-death-ruled-a-suicide/\">died of an overdose of Dilaudid</a>, which is a brand-name of the opioid painkiller hydromorphone. TheLastLineOfDefense.org also ran a series of stories in which <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-boat-that-killed-hillary-and-chelsea-clinton-sabotaged/\">Hillary and Chelsea Clinton died in a boating accident</a> that was the result of sabotage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton is still very much in the news, since Republican members of Congress continue to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2017/08/03/541219022/calls-to-investigate-clinton-pose-a-challenge-to-u-s-political-norms\">push for investigations into her own campaign activities</a>.
