Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaleka, a 35-year-old Democrat and documentary <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2394430/\"><u>filmmaker</u></a>, was <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/Son-of-slain-temple-president-considers-run-for-Congress/-/9374034/22524536/-/pb4p1s/-/index.html\"><u>interviewed</u></a> about his planned candidacy on the Oct. 20, 2013 edition of &quot;Upfront with Mike Gousha,&quot; a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Gousha asked Kaleka what he would say to people who might view him as a one-dimensional candidate focused on guns, Kaleka turned the conversation to the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I mean, gun legislation is just one of the many things that are holding us down economically. A number of other things, immigration reform, the economic disparity that we&rsquo;re experiencing, has to do with our thoughts and models that we&rsquo;ve had in place for now, well over two decades,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I mean, the Midwest is a great example of how we&rsquo;re losing so many factories and manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. For example, we used to be called America&#39;s Dairyland. Now, California is called America&#39;s Dairyland. We sent them fresh water, and we sold it to them. Ultimately, we didn&#39;t get anything in exchange. We lost a bunch of jobs, a bunch of farmland.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been two decades since California <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/printdairy.html\"><u>eclipsed</u></a> Wisconsin in milk production, although Wisconsin still calls itself <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/drivers/plateguide/auto.htm\"><u>America&rsquo;s Dairyland</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we&rsquo;ve never heard that Wisconsin had sold fresh water to California to boost their dairy industry -- and lost jobs and farmland in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t there have been a titanic hue and cry if that had ever happened?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Big ideas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, there have been some grandiose proposals to sell Great Lakes water to faraway places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998, a Canadian company actually obtained a permit from Ontario to ship fresh water by tankers from Lake Superior to Asia. But after a backlash in Canada and the United States, the permit was canceled two weeks later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Richardson raised the possibility of exporting Great Lakes water to the Southwest, calling for a national water policy and saying &quot;states like Wisconsin are awash in water.&quot; But less than two weeks after Richardson&rsquo;s comments rattled Midwest politicians, his campaign <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29338349.html#ixzz2iZ60Ud4S\"><u>issued a statement</u></a> saying Richardson &quot;in no way proposes federal transfers of water from one region of the nation to the other.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following year, the eight Great Lakes states reached agreement on the <a href=\"http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/greatlakes/compact.html\"><u>Great Lakes Compact</u></a>, which bans Great Lakes water from being &quot;diverted,&quot; or piped out of the basin, with a few exceptions, such as the possible sale of Lake Michigan water from Oak Creek to another Milwaukee suburb, Waukesha, which is <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/new-waukesha-lake-diversion-documents-tout-benefits-to-great-lakes-b99117997z1-227617921.html?ipad=y\"><u>under consideration</u></a>. Even then, Waukesha would<strong> </strong>have to<strong> </strong>return 100 percent of the water by volume to the lake by discharging treated wastewater to the Root River in Franklin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the compact, officials remain wary of outsiders coveting Great Lakes water, said <a href=\"http://www.glc.org/about/staff/teder.html\"><u>Tim Eder</u></a>, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.glc.org/about/\"><u>Great Lakes Commission</u></a>, an interstate agency that promotes the development, use and conservation of water in the Great Lakes basin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, was there a Wisconsin sale of fresh water to California before the 2008 compact?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No way. It&#39;s really simple,&quot; Eder said of Kaleka&rsquo;s claim. &quot;He&rsquo;s wrong. I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s getting his information, but it&rsquo;s not based in fact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other experts -- Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water use section chief Eric Ebersberger, and <a href=\"http://environmentalchange.nd.edu/people/\"><u>Peter Annin</u></a>, managing director of the University of Notre Dame <a href=\"http://environmentalchange.nd.edu/about/\"><u>Environmental Change Initiative</u></a>, which does research on water resources -- were also dumbfounded and emphatic: No water sale to California has ever occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if it never occurred, it certainly didn&rsquo;t boost the dairy industry there, or mean lost jobs or farmland here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, federal figures show that in 2012, Wisconsin produced <a href=\"http://usda01.library.cornell.edu/usda/nass/MilkProd/2010s/2013/MilkProd-02-20-2013.pdf\"><u>27.2 billion pounds</u></a> of milk, a <a href=\"http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Wisconsin/Publications/Dairy/anmkpd.pdf\"><u>record</u></a> for the state, and led the nation by producing <a href=\"http://usda01.library.cornell.edu/usda/current/DairProdSu/DairProdSu-04-29-2013.pdf\"><u>2.79 billion pounds</u></a> of cheese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Said Annin, author of <a href=\"http://www.greatlakeswaterwars.com/\"><u>&quot;The Great Lakes Water Wars&quot;</u></a>: &quot;I&rsquo;m not aware of any instance where the State of Wisconsin, or anybody in the state of Wisconsin, sold water to California. There&rsquo;ve been a lot of weird proposals, but they&rsquo;ve never actually happened.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also checked with the federal <a href=\"http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/About/MississippiRiverCommission%28MRC%29.aspx\"><u>Mississippi River Commission</u></a>, which assured us that water from the Mississippi River was never sold to California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaleka, meanwhile, told us he meant to say &quot;we thought about sending them fresh water.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added: &quot;I&#39;m going to have to take my hit on this. It was a sloppy response to a very big problem of local and national economics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on even that he is off. None of the information Kaleka provided us indicates that Wisconsin even considered selling water to California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we could find no record of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaleka said Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and &quot;lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence of such a water sale, something that would have made for countless front-page stories, let alone it leading to a loss of jobs and farmland in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is false and ridiculous: Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-did-wisconsin-sell-water-to-california-to-boost-dairy-industry-there-b99127571z1-229150881.html?page=1\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s web site</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-23T16:01:48.664044", "ruling_date": "2013-10-28T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin sold fresh water to California, potential Democratic congressional candidate says", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-sold-fresh-water-california-potential-de", "ruling_link_text": "Never happened", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WISN.com, &quot;Upfront with Mike Gousha&quot; <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/Son-of-slain-temple-president-considers-run-for-Congress/-/9374034/22524536/-/pb4p1s/-/index.html\"><u>interview</u></a> (quote at 1:40) of Amar Kaleka, broadcast Oct. 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, <a href=\"http://www.glc.org/about/\"><u>Great Lakes Commission</u></a>, an interstate agency that promotes the development, use and conservation of water in the Great Lakes basin. &nbsp;executive director <a href=\"http://www.glc.org/about/staff/teder.html\"><u>Tim Eder</u></a>, Oct. 23, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water use section chief Eric Ebersberger, Oct. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, University of Notre Dame <a href=\"http://environmentalchange.nd.edu/about/\"><u>Environmental Change Initiative</u></a> managing director <a href=\"http://environmentalchange.nd.edu/people/\"><u>Peter Annin</u></a>, &nbsp;author of <a href=\"http://www.greatlakeswaterwars.com/\"><u>The Great Lakes Water Wars</u></a>, Oct. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ottawa Citizen, &quot;Ontario revokes water-export permit,&quot; May 15, 1998</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calgary Herald, &quot;Ottawa intends to torpedo Lake Superior water shipments,&quot; May 2, 1998</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29338349.html\"><u>&quot;Richardson backs off on water shifts,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 16, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Amar Kaleka, Oct. 23, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Amardeep", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2475, "last_name": "Kaleka", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "amardeep-kaleka", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Amardeep_Kaleka_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2475/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Wisconsin sold fresh water to California, helping that state&#39;s dairy industry, and &quot;lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2013-10-20", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 122, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/122/", "subject": "Agriculture", "subject_slug": "agriculture", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 197, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/197/", "subject": "Water", "subject_slug": "water", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
