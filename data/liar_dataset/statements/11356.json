The U.S. Census Bureau compiles the income data each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the 10 counties with the highest median income in 2013, the latest year for which <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/highlights/2013.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>figures</u></a> are available:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loudoun County, Va. -- $117,680</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Falls Church, Va. -- $117,452</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Los Alamos County, N.M. -- $110,930</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairfax County, Va. -- $110,658</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howard County, Md. -- $108,503</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunterdon County, N.J -- $107,203</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas County, Colo. -- $105,192</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arlington County, Va. -- $101,533</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morris County, N.J. -- $99,950</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Montgomery County, Md. -- $97,873</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That list includes six counties -- four in Virginia and two in Maryland -- that are located outside Washington. Although Falls Church is a city, it&rsquo;s treated as a county by the Census Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at the annual Census Bureau figures going back to 2009. In each of those years, there also were a half-dozen D.C. suburban counties that made the top 10 list of the highest median household income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the federal government is the major seed of affluence in the D.C. area, sprouting high-paying government and contracting jobs. The suburbs have some of the highest education levels in the nation, according to Terry Rephann, a regional economist at the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should make a statistical note here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Median household income is the midrange point where half of the county&rsquo;s households make more than the median and the other half makes less. For example, if only five families lived in a county, the median income would be that of the third highest-earning household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all measures rank the D.C. suburbs among the 10 richest counties. Money magazine, for example, looked at average income -- the total income in a county divided by its residents. Based on that data from 2012, none of the counties near Washington made a Money list of the 10 richest counties published last year. If you&rsquo;re wondering, No. 1 in was Teton County in &nbsp;Wyoming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rephann, however, told us that average income can easily be thrown off by a few extremely wealthy people living in a less populous rural county. Median income is a better way to measure the richest counties, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also note that while median incomes are high around Washington, that doesn&rsquo;t mean everything is rosy there.
