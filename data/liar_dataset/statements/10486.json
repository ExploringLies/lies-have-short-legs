It made no mention of the Wisconsin Idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison-based group, <a href=\"http://www.prwatch.org/news/2015/02/12724/walker-strikes-truth-wisconsin-idea-university-budget\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reported</u></a> that the 1,800-page <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/related/proposals/sb21.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>budget bill</u></a> itself included language that, in effect, struck the Wisconsin Idea from the mission of the University of Wisconsin System. That mission is contained in a state statute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As shown in a photo accompanying this story, Walker&rsquo;s budget deletes a number of phrases contained in the statute. Among the statements that are removed: &quot;Extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses&quot;; and &quot;Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With some added language, the edits to the language emphasized the mission should be to &quot;meet the state&rsquo;s workforce needs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How changes occurred</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s &quot;drafting-error&quot; explanation suggests the rewriting of the UW System&#39;s mission was some kind of mistake -- changes made inadvertently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s spokeswoman told us the governor had learned shortly before sending his tweet that &quot;there was a miscommunication during the back and forth of the budget process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the evidence indicates the changes to<strong> </strong>the Wisconsin Idea language were intentional. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/documents-show-walker-administration-seeking-removal-of-uws-wisconsin-idea-b99439710z1-290927651.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>revealed</u></a> by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, based on emails and other information gathered by the newspaper:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>As the budget was being prepared, Walker&rsquo;s administration insisted to UW System officials that the changes to the Wisconsin Idea language be made.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>In December 2014, a budget analyst in Walker&#39;s Department of Administration&nbsp;directed the nonpartisan budget-writing office to remove the phrase &quot;Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth&quot; from the state statute covering the UW System&#39;s mission.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>In January 2015, the same analyst&nbsp;told the budget-writing office to remove another phrase: &quot;To extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Five days before Walker introduced his budget, a UW System official sent an email to Walker&#39;s budget staff raising concerns about the changes, saying: &quot;We strongly urge that stricken language is unique to depicting the character, mission and vision of the UW System.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>That UW official, John Yingling, later told the Journal Sentinel that Walker&rsquo;s budget staff responded by saying the changes would remain in the budget.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Backtracking from earlier statements, Walker eventually admitted that UW System officials had thrown up red flags and been rebuffed -- although he also said there &quot;was a confusion out there&quot; and &quot;it was a mistake that someone made.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s office also issued a <a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/newsroom/press-release/governor-scott-walker-releases-statement-proposed-university-wisconsin-system\">statement</a> claiming that when his office told the budget staff to &quot;keep it simple, they took that to mean that we only wanted workforce readiness language in the mission when we really wanted the language added to the existing mission statement.....It was a simple miscommunication during the natural back and forth of this process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said fundamental changes to the language describing the Wisconsin Idea in the University of Wisconsin System&#39;s mission statement were the result of a &quot;drafting error&quot; in his state budget proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Walker&rsquo;s administration had insisted to UW System officials on making the changes, giving detailed instructions on passages to be removed from state law. And eventually Walker himself acknowledged that the UW System had objected to the changes before his budget was put into final form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His original claim was not only inaccurate, but ridiculous.
