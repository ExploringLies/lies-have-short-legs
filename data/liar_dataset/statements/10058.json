Rick Scott&rsquo;s re-election campaign has not been afraid to exploit is how many Floridians lost their jobs during Charlie Crist&rsquo;s term as governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Oct. 10 Telemundo debate in Miramar, Scott noted about a half dozen times that 832,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed while Crist was in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott spent much of the debate blaming Crist for worsening conditions during the new Democrat&rsquo;s term, but he kept coming back to jobs. &quot;You want to talk about jobs &ndash; Charlie, 832,000 people lost their job while you were governor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jobs numbers have been a major talking point for the current governor as far back as his 2010 campaign, when he first promised to bring 700,000 jobs -- and then up to 1.7 million jobs -- to the state over seven years. Our Scott-O-Meter says that promise is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/588/create-over-700000-jobs/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>In The Works</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott also said the state lost 825,000 jobs under Crist, a claim we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/dec/14/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-economy-soured-under-char/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True</u></a> in 2012, because Crist, like any governor caught in the midst of a recession, had little control over job losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the debate, Scott offered a slightly larger figure -- 832,000. Is this number accurate? PolitiFact Florida took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Numbers game</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve followed what we&rsquo;ve written on this question over the years, you&rsquo;ve no doubt noticed that the numbers change from time to time. Economists regularly revise these numbers based on new information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further complicating matters, Scott&rsquo;s campaign website has cited <a href=\"http://www.rickscottforflorida.com/the-scott-record/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>private-sector job losses of 828,800 under Crist</u></a>, specifically from January 2007, when Crist took office, to December 2010, Crist&rsquo;s last month in office. Understanding the different time spans being measured, and what exactly they are measuring, helps explain the nuances of this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, we&rsquo;ll note that there&rsquo;s a difference between private-sector jobs and all jobs; the main difference with the latter is that it includes government jobs. For the same months as Scott&rsquo;s chart -- January 2007 through December 2010 -- the BLS reports that Florida lost 822,200 private-sector jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis (a process that smooths out month-to-month comparisons). The number for total nonfarm job losses during the same time period, seasonally adjusted, was 836,700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where is the Scott campaign getting 832,000? They changed the time frame to between December 2006 -- the month before Crist took office -- and December 2010. In that case,&nbsp;the total for seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs was 832,700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason the number decreased is because the number jobs went up slightly between December 2006 and January 2007. This means the December calculation starts from a lower baseline than the January calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we measured private-sector jobs -- which, incidentally, is the kind that Scott routinely touts for his own record, perhaps because the numbers look rosier for him -- we came up with a loss of 819,600 over the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the big picture, the magnitude of the difference isn&rsquo;t all that great. The 832,700 figure is only 1.5 percent bigger than the 819,600 figure. Whichever number you choose, these job losses don&rsquo;t&nbsp;look good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where Crist has some cover is that he&rsquo;s hardly the primary reason for these job losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts have consistently told PolitiFact Florida that it&#39;s hard to tell how much influence the governor of any one state has on job losses (or -- sorry, Gov. Scott -- job creation). It may take years to find out whether policies have had any effect on job totals at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody&rsquo;s Analytics who studies Florida, noted back in 2012 that by the time Crist took office in 2007, &quot;the seeds of destruction&quot; had already been sown. An overheated housing market and dirty dealings in the lending industry had long been entrenched problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That had very very little to do with Charlie Crist,&quot; Lafakis said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott said &quot;832,000 people lost their job&quot; while Crist was governor, blaming his opponent for not doing enough while in office to improve Florida&rsquo;s growing ranks of the unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to quibble with the specific number of job losses that occurred under Crist, but the differences are small -- 1.5 percent in one direction or the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bigger issue is that it&rsquo;s a stretch for Scott to ascribe blame for job losses on a governor&rsquo;s watch, since it&rsquo;s unclear whether any given governor&rsquo;s policies have had an effect on employment trends. If Scott is trying to impugn Crist&rsquo;s record on jobs during a recession -- something that depends heavily on the national and international economic picture -- he&rsquo;s largely off base, even if his numbers are pretty close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-10T16:28:01.747976", "ruling_date": "2014-10-10T16:37:57", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott blames Charlie Crist for 832,000 job losses", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-blames-charle-crist-832000-job-losses", "ruling_link_text": "You can't lay all the blame on any one governor", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rick Scott, Telemundo gubernatorial debate, Oct. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/588/create-over-700000-jobs/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>700,000 jobs promise plods along, despite numbers debate</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/dec/14/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-economy-soured-under-char/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rick Scott says Florida&#39;s economy soured under Charlie Crist</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 11, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/616/grow-floridas-economy-by-74-billion-in-state-gdp/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Indicators close to goals, but Scott can&#39;t take all the credit</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida non-farm jobs from 2007-2014, accessed Oct. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida private jobs from 2007-2014, accessed Oct. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Timothy Ewing, U.S. Department of Labor economist, Oct. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Greg Blair, Scott campaign spokesperson, Oct. 10, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 32, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 40, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 383, "last_name": "Scott", "mostly_true_count": 36, "name_slug": "rick-scott", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rlscott.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/383/", "total_count": 166, "true_count": 15, "website": "http://www.flgov.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;832,000 people lost their job while (Charlie Crist was)&nbsp;governor.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a gubernatorial debate in Miramar", "statement_date": "2014-10-10", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 15, "current_job": "", "false_count": 9, "first_name": "Charlie", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 257, "last_name": "Crist", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "charlie-crist", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/crist.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/257/", "total_count": 90, "true_count": 15, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
