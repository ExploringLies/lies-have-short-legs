And it has reached a fever pitch with a Republican National Convention dominated by criticism of Obama&rsquo;s comment that business people &quot;didn&rsquo;t build&quot; their businesses. (We&rsquo;ve checked that contentious comment <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/\">here</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring his speech to delegates in Tampa, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- widely considered a finalist for the vice presidential slot eventually given to Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan -- brought up Obama&rsquo;s career history again. He contrasted Obama&rsquo;s work experiences with those of GOP nominee Mitt Romney, whose work has primarily been as a business executive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Then you have Barack Obama, who never started a business--never even worked in business,&quot; Portman said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama&rsquo;s work experience, or lack thereof, is well-plowed ground. So we thought we&#39;d explore whether the president has ever worked in a business. (We interpreted Portman&rsquo;s statement to mean that Obama had never worked in a private, profit-making enterprise.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs PolitiFact first <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/15/joe-scarborough/heres-scoop-obama-has-worked-ice-cream-business-am/\">noted</a> two years ago, the president does, in fact, have some experience in business.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1983 and 1984, he had a stint as a research assistant at Business International Corp. in New York City, where he helped write a newsletter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom 1993 to 2004, he was an associate, and then a partner, at the Chicago law firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, where his work included employment-discrimination and voting-rights cases. (The job also overlapped with his time in the Illinois Legislature.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you count the best-selling books that have brought Obama millions of dollars in royalties, he also knows something about entrepreneurship.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClearly, Obama has had less experience in the private sector than Romney; before he became president, he spent most of his working life either in the non-profit sector or in politics. However, Portman went too far when he said that Obama has &quot;never even worked in business.&quot; We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-29T21:16:08.465558", "ruling_date": "2012-08-29T21:28:47", "ruling_headline": "At GOP convention, Rob Portman says Barack Obama \u201cnever even worked in business.\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-convention-rob-portman-says-barack-obama-never", "ruling_link_text": "Not a lot of experience in business, but some", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRob Portman, speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Aug. 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-barack-obama-has-no-private-sector-exp/\">Romney says Barack Obama has no private sector experience</a>,&quot; Oct. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/15/joe-scarborough/heres-scoop-obama-has-worked-ice-cream-business-am/\"> &quot;Joe Scarborough: President Obama has never received a paycheck from a profitmaking business in his entire life</a>,&quot; April 15, 2009<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "U.S. senator from Ohio", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Rob", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 534, "last_name": "Portman", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "rob-portman", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rob-Portman-official-portrait.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/534/", "total_count": 48, "true_count": 17, "website": "http://portman.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama has &quot;never even worked in business.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa", "statement_date": "2012-08-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
