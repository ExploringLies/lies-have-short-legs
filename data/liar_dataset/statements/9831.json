Jim Doyle.

They were Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management; Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy; and Dale Knapp, research director at Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three cautioned that comparing quarters can lead to distortions -- and we noted that the last quarter before Walker saw an unusually large jump in personal income. That was due in part to an early shift in Medicaid payments to that quarter, the Walker campaign correctly points out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statistical effect is a bigger starting point for Walker, meaning any gains on his watch look smaller than they would otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another defensible starting point is the first quarter of 2011, our experts said, which takes in Walker&rsquo;s first three months. But that distorts in the other direction because the Medicaid payments -- having been shifted earlier -- look much lower. Using that baseline, Wisconsin&rsquo;s growth was second-best in the Midwest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Walker campaign doesn&rsquo;t argue for using the 2011 base. They, and our experts, prefer to look at annual growth rates which smooth out the volatility you see in quarterly data. From 2010 to 2013, we found Wisconsin ranked 9th of the 12 Midwest states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, anomalies pop up in the numbers once in a while due to governmental policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his claim of &quot;We&rsquo;re #1,&quot; Walker reached back one year from the latest quarter to a quarter that saw the biggest single-quarter loss in personal income in three years. That of course made the state look better in the comparison he chose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loss was partly due to Washington&rsquo;s &quot;fiscal-cliff legislation,&quot; which served to artificially boost incomes in late 2012, thereby depressing personal income in the quarter that was Walker&rsquo;s one-year base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And partisans pick the presentation that best makes their case -- in this case, both Walker and his critics chose to compare quarterly figures rather than annual rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker could have chosen an annual comparison -- 2012 to 2013, which is the most recent for which a full calendar year is available. But by that measure Wisconsin is middle of the pack on growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no one right way, our experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it is perfectly honest and accurate to say income grew 10.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2014,&quot; Jacobsen said, referring to the comparison that shows Wisconsin last in the Midwest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Walker correctly pointed out that personal income growth is the best in the Midwest for the last year, commentators alleged that Wisconsin is &quot;dead last in income growth&quot; during Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s three-plus years in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quarterly figures do put Wisconsin at the bottom, based on the starting point endorsed by the agency that compiled the information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reader beware: Any such quarterly comparison has its flaws, as we&rsquo;ve seen in these related claims. But by the numbers, the blogosphere&rsquo;s claim is on target.
