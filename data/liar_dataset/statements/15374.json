With a distinctive Wisconsin tone, Bryce said: &quot;Let&rsquo;s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I&rsquo;ll go to D.C.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least in Democratic circles, Bryce became a sensation. Ten months later, his prospects improved dramatically when Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, announced he would not seek re-election to his southern Wisconsin seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But despite Bryce&rsquo;s everyman image, which he has <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/wisconsin/articles/2018-03-05/ryan-challenger-bryce-launches-new-television-ad\">continued</a> to cultivate in the campaign, a claim he made on the May 6, 2018, edition of &quot;The Circus,&quot; a weekly political program on the Showtime cable network, caught our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It came during this exchange with co-host Mark McKinnon, as Bryce made a reference to President <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bryce: </strong>Last year at this time, I was working on a parking structure, and just talking with the co-workers, just really ticked off at what&#39;s going on, and they&#39;re like, what are you going to do? And I was like, well, I&#39;ll show you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>McKinnon:</strong> So you&#39;re not a politician?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Bryce: </strong>No, and I think that&#39;s what people like. But I mean, people voted for Trump because he was seen as a non-establishment type guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationally, Bryce is a newbie; but this isn&rsquo;t his first electoral rodeo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s check his claim that he is <em>not </em>a politician.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/politifact.wisconsin/\">Like us on Facebook</a>.

Four of them, including Bryce, <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Past_elections_in_the_Racine_Unified_School_District#2013\">were eliminated</a> in the primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. November 2014:</strong> <a href=\"http://journaltimes.com/news/local/wanggaard-reclaims-senate-seat/article_216bd4a9-23ee-5227-841b-0f3d122b6865.html\">Bryce lost</a> in the general election for an open seat in the state Senate. He was defeated, <a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/11.4.14%20Summary%20Results-all%20offices.pdf\">61 percent</a> to 39 percent, by a Republican who formerly held the seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To <a href=\"https://uwm.edu/political-science/people/lee-mordecai/\">Mordecai Lee</a>, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee political science professor and former Democratic state lawmaker, Bryce seems more like &quot;a wanna-be politician.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s easier to say who<em> is </em>a politician,&quot; Lee said, referring to current elected officials in jobs that pay more or less a full-time salary. &quot;Short of that, it sort of becomes a rhetorical somersault.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his current campaign means Bryce is now making his fourth run for public office in six years &mdash; arguably, enough to make him a perennial candidate. And running for Congress is a much larger venture than school board, or even the statehouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s not an obvious point when a person becomes a politician,&quot; said <a href=\"https://faculty.polisci.wisc.edu/bcburden/\">Barry Burden</a>, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist, &quot;but Bryce has done enough things that he&rsquo;s clearly moving toward that category.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/\">Taegan Goddard</a>, publisher of Political Wire, was stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you continue to run, you&rsquo;re spending a decent amount of effort trying to win public office &mdash; you&rsquo;re a politician in that case,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;If you&rsquo;re going to spend that much time running for a congressional seat,&quot; he added, &quot;that is a full-time job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, for Bryce to flatly reject the label of politician as he did on Showtime, verges on disingenuous. In the eyes of a typical ironworker who has never run for public office, Bryce&rsquo;s four runs might make him look very much like a politician. And he hasn&rsquo;t been working the iron during 2018, his campaign told us, as he runs full time for Ryan&rsquo;s seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>More Randy Bryce fact-checks:</p>\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>His campaign staff &quot;first to unionize in the history of politics.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/25/randy-bryce/campaign-staff-randy-bryce-whos-running-paul-ryans/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Under his own bill, Trump&#39;s family could not have come to U.S. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/19/randy-bryce/would-trump-bill-have-kept-his-grandfather-and-mel/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>Ryan hasn&rsquo;t held a public town hall in the district in 600 days. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/21/randy-bryce/challenger-target-claim-paul-ryan-has-gone-600-day/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Bryce&rsquo;s campaign says it has raised <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/2018/bryce-campaign-raised-700000-halfway-through-quarter-2/\">$5.5 million</a>, while winning <a href=\"https://www.randybryceforcongress.com/endorsements/\">endorsements</a> from the likes of a former presidenetial candidate -- U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/bernie-s/\">Bernie Sanders</a>&nbsp;-- and national unions such as the United Auto Workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s high-level stuff, not just a citizen tossing his hat in the ring for a part-time gig on the local school board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while Bryce hasn&rsquo;t won public office or held a government position, he has been active in party politics; he is currently <a href=\"http://www.wisdems.org/our-party/caucuses\">chairman</a> of the veterans caucus of the Wisconsin Democratic Party and <a href=\"http://www.racinecountydems.com/about-us.html\">first vice chairman</a> of the Racine County Democratic Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce says he is not a politician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ironworker and candidate for Ryan&rsquo;s U.S. House seat has not been elected to public office and has not held a government position.
