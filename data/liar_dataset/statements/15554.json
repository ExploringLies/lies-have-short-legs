Like the claim that a Trump supporter had tried to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/28/blog-posting/no-trump-supporter-did-not-try-murder-rep-maxine-w/\">murder</a> Waters, this headline is false.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook&#39;s News Feed. (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">Read more</a> about our partnership with Facebook.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Laura Loomer, a conservative investigative journalist, is charging &lsquo;Auntie&rsquo; Maxine for assault, citing Waters hit her hand and swatted her face with office papers,&quot; the article reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blog post cites a tweet by Loomer that reads: &quot;BREAKING: Today I filed a police report w/<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapitolPolice\"> @CapitolPolice</a> against<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepMaxineWaters\"> @RepMaxineWaters</a>. Yesterday when I confronted her on Capitol Hill, she ASSAULTED me. She hit my hand, then she swatted me in the face twice w/ her papers. I&rsquo;m pressing charges against her.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.weeklystandard.com/holmes-lybrand/fact-check-is-maxine-waters-getting-criminally-charged\">video</a> Loomer posted of the incident shows Loomer chasing after Waters in the halls of Congress. Waters responds each question by saying a variation of, &quot;Come to my office, I&rsquo;ll be happy to sit down with you. We can&rsquo;t talk on the run.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Loomer does not desist, Waters holds a piece of paper over her face and waves Loomer&rsquo;s recording device away. Waters eventually walks into a members-only elevator on her way to a vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filing a police report does not equate having criminal charges brought against Waters. A criminal charge can only be made by a government authority, which Loomer is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A police report could trigger a criminal charge if a prosecutor brought the charges to a grand jury and they chose to pursue it,&quot; Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University, told us. &quot;But the mere filing of a complaint by an individual who feels aggrieved does not constitute a criminal charge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers said Waters is getting criminally charged. But that&rsquo;s a misreading of what happened, and how the U.S. criminal justice system works. We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-29T12:37:05.820178", "ruling_date": "2018-06-29T14:13:35", "ruling_headline": "No, Maxine Waters is not facing criminal charges", "ruling_headline_slug": "loomer-maxine-waters-not-facing-criminal-charges", "ruling_link_text": "Police report not a criminal charge", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Conservativepost.com, <a href=\"https://conservativepost.com/maxine-waters-is-getting-criminally-charged/\">Maxine Waters Is Getting Criminally Charged!</a>, June 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1011800931946688513\">Laura Loomer</a>, June 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tweet, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealKyleMorris/status/1011989781016973314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1011989781016973314&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weeklystandard.com%2Fholmes-lybrand%2Ffact-check-is-maxine-waters-getting-criminally-charged\">Real Kyle Morris</a>, June 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Kathleen Clark, law professor at Washington University, June 29, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Maxine Waters Is Getting Criminally Charged!&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post headline", "statement_date": "2018-06-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
