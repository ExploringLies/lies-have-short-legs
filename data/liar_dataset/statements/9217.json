Don Balfour, a Republican from Gwinnett County, offered an explanation for the legislation that prompted us to do some fact-checking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you get a commercial pilot&rsquo;s license, you learn to communicate in English no matter where you are in the world -- because it is a practical necessity for everyone in the air to be able to communicate in a common language,&quot; Balfour said in a glossy, four-page newsletter the lawmaker sent to his constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State law already makes English the official language of Georgia, though the code permits government agencies to issue forms in other languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balfour&rsquo;s bill, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1109157-don-balfour-newsletter.html\">Senate Resolution 1031,</a> did not pass this year. It was sent to the Senate&rsquo;s Rules Committee, but it never got a vote by the entire Senate. Critics recoiled at some aspects of the bill, such as requiring a driver&rsquo;s license exam be done in English. The test is currently available in 11 languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to some fatal accidents where the lack of proficiency of English appeared to be a factor, one major international organization of air traffic controllers and pilots created guidelines for them to speak English to communicate in the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, the International Civil Aviation Organization determined that pilots, air traffic controllers and aeronautical station operators involved in international operations should be able to speak and understand English at a specific proficiency. The ICAO, which works with the United Nations through a special agreement, serves 191 countries. It was formed in the 1940s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list of countries includes traditional foes of industrialized nations such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran and Venezuela. North Korea is not on the list, although there&rsquo;s not much worldwide commerce with that nation. North Korea reportedly does most of its trade with China. A handful of newer nations are not on the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ICAO tests can be administered by companies or organizations within various countries that adhere to the ICAO&rsquo;s regulations, and they are designed specifically for aviation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, the federal government requires commercial pilots to read, speak, write and understand English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You do have to know English,&quot; said Sarah Dunn, a senior communications and public affairs associate of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dunn, too, cited the ICAO&rsquo;s rules. NATCA represents over 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and other safety-related professionals. She noted that some pilots&rsquo; English is better than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, as Balfour said, commercial pilots across nearly the entire world are required to speak some English. Since there are a few countries not on the list, we believe there is a little context that needs to be understood. We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-21T16:26:04.903122", "ruling_date": "2014-04-22T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lawmaker's pilot claim travels safe", "ruling_headline_slug": "lawmakers-pilot-claim-travels-safe", "ruling_link_text": "Claim doesn't veer from the truth", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>State Sen.
