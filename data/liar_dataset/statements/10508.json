Scott Walker, one he&rsquo;s taking national as he <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">charges up a potential presidential campaign</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He inherited a $3.6 billion budget shortfall from Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, but dug out of it by cutting costs and limiting union bargaining power with state and local government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker even dropped the figure into his well-received January 2015 &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4525006/wisconsin-governor-scott-walker-iowa-freedom-summit\">speech</a> at an Iowa cattle call for 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So our eyebrows went up Feb. 6, 2015 when Walker was questioned about his stewardship of the state budget by Fox News anchor Bret Baier in a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report-bret-baier/videos#p/86927/v/4037146201001\">profile</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">rising presidential hopes of the Wisconsin governor.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the interview, Baier said: &quot;You talk about $2 billion in (tax) savings for individuals and businesses, but you also have a $2.2 billion budget shortfall in the coming two years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker immediately questioned the credibility of the $2.2 billion number and portrayed it as a media creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would contend that&rsquo;s based on numbers from some of the Wisconsin media outlets as if everybody who asked for anything got it,&quot; Walker said. &quot;Even in your own household budget that never happens.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has Walker changed his view on the validity of these shortfall estimates now that he&rsquo;s in the governor&rsquo;s chair?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another one for the Flip-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to November 2010, shortly after his election to replace Doyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker pounced on the numbers from a statutorily required report by the state Department of Administration that showed -- in combination with other debts -- Walker would inherit a $3.6 billion shortfall six months after taking office in January 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time and again &hellip;. and again &hellip; Walker used that number to portray the state as broke, and to explain the cuts he proposed -- and which were ultimately made -- in public education funding and other programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, and other media outlets, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/25/mark-pocan/wisconsin-state-rep-mark-pocan-says-gov-scott-walk/\">examined the figure</a> then and declared it credible, as far as it goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve explained, it&rsquo;s not a &quot;deficit&quot; number as Walker and others in Madison often call it. It&rsquo;s a pre-budget estimate designed to illustrate the size of the shortfall or challenge the governor faces when putting together a budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shortfall figure includes all the requests from state departments, and also predictions of how much tax revenue the state will collect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward to the Fox interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said the report of a $2.2 billion shortfall heading into his budget was a media creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the fact is, it came from a <a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/November20Report.pdf\">report from his own budget shop in his Department of Administration.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, tax cuts pushed by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature play into some of the challenge that faced budget-makers, as projected revenues have fallen short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by far the biggest chunk of the $2.2 billion projection is -- as Walker alluded to on Fox -- the spending increases sought by state agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s always been the case. That&rsquo;s the purpose of the report -- to see how tax revenue projections are looking compared to what state agencies say they want and need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing&rsquo;s changed about the methodology behind the shortfall projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing that&rsquo;s changed is Walker&rsquo;s tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He still talks up the 2010 figures as if describing a budget-balancing miracle, but now dismisses their 2014 version as a big nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This merits a Full Flop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-13T15:31:15.508445", "ruling_date": "2015-02-13T18:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Scott Walker flip-flop on how budget shortfalls are measured??", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-scott-walker-flip-flip-budget-shortfall", "ruling_link_text": "No change in methods, only in view of them", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, Bret Baier interview with Gov.
