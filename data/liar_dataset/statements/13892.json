In a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-announces-campaign-convention-manager-paul-j.-manafort\">press release</a> announcing the hiring, Trump praised Manafort as &quot;a great asset and an important addition&quot; in consolidating the support Trump won during the primary season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party,&quot; Trump said in a statement that highlighted Manafort&rsquo;s extensive political experience in &quot;dozens of international political campaigns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a week later, Trump expanded Manafort&rsquo;s portfolio to include all functions related to the nomination process, as well as additional roles coordinating outreach efforts and establishing a new office in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am organizing these responsibilities under someone who has done this job successfully in many campaigns,&quot; Trump said in a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-announces-expansion-of-nomination-efforts-under-convention\">statement</a>. &quot;Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manafort also began appearing on&nbsp;national television to represent the campaign. Manafort&rsquo;s April 24 appearance on <em>Fox News Sunday</em> was posted on the Trump campaign&rsquo;s official website, for example. (The post has since been removed, but can be seen <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160731014947/http://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/trump-adviser-manafort-says-changing-the-setting-not-the-candidate\">here</a>.) In his Sunday show interview, Manafort defended Trump&rsquo;s campaign style and evolving strategy, and went on offense against then-Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, calling Trump&rsquo;s most formidable rival for the Republican nomination a &quot;liar.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manafort&rsquo;s promotion to Trump campaign chairman and chief strategist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 19, Trump promoted Manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said that Corey Lewandowski, who had been managing the Trump campaign, would &quot;continue overseeing day-to-day operations and will work with Manafort on political strategy and communications, among other things, through the general election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In weeks leading up to the July Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-announces-key-appointments\">announced</a> it had hired veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway to &quot;serve as senior advisor to the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roughly one month after the July GOP convention, with Trump&rsquo;s poll numbers in decline and the campaign dealing with ongoing controversy, Trump announced Manafort&rsquo;s resignation, concluding Manafort&rsquo;s 20-week tenure with the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,&quot; Trump said in an <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement1\">August 19 statement</a>.&quot; I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spicer said Manafort had a &quot;limited&quot; role with the Trump campaign, but even Spicer admitted himself that characterization wasn&rsquo;t correct. Not only did Manafort work to consolidate &nbsp;Trump&#39;s support ahead of the Republican National Convention, but he was later promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. He made multiple media appearances on behalf of Trump and worked alongside Trump&rsquo;s closest advisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Spicer&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-22T17:15:12.640228", "ruling_date": "2017-03-22T17:54:01", "ruling_headline": "Sean Spicer\u2019s False claim that Paul Manafort played a minor role in the Trump campaign", "ruling_headline_slug": "sean-spicers-false-claim-paul-manafort-played-mino", "ruling_link_text": "Other than being campaign chairman", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House press <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/20/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-3202017\">briefing</a>, March 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/?utm_term=.0ce8bffe2d00 Associated Press, &quot;Trump campaign chief linked to Putin interests,&quot; March 22, 2017 https://www.apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a/Manafort's-plan-to-'greatly-benefit-the-Putin-Government?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">Transcript</a>, House Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Election, March 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump Campaign <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-announces-campaign-convention-manager-paul-j.-manafort\">press release</a>, &quot;Donald J.
