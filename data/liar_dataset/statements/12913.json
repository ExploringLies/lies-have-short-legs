When called on to protect Israel, some legislators step up,&quot; states the mailer, showing photos of U.S. Reps.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://teddeutch.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398471\">Ted Deutch </a>and <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rep-lois-frankel-opposes-iran-deal/2244537\">Lois Frankel </a>of Palm Beach County and <a href=\"https://www.schumer.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/my-position-on-the-iran-deal\">Sen. Chuck Schumer</a> of New York. &quot;Others don&rsquo;t. Debbie Wasserman Schultz waffled back and forth before voting for the Iran nuclear deal, choosing party and personal political ambition over principle.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how would Canova have voted on the deal? His answers haven&rsquo;t been clear. In a <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article95614137.html\">debate </a>on CBS4, host Jim DeFede asked Canova to clarify his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to look at Canova&rsquo;s statements about the Iran deal and put them on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate&rsquo;s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes. We found that Canova hasn&rsquo;t really changed position, but he hasn&rsquo;t always provided full answers, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Canova isn&rsquo;t Jewish, but his stepfather is Jewish, and Canova said he has spent time in Israel including living on a kibbutz, a communal living area. Wasserman Schultz was the first Jewish woman from Florida elected to Congress.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Canova&rsquo;s statements about Iran nuclear deal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, Iran and five other world powers&nbsp;reached a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/08/politifact-sheet-6-things-know-about-iran-nuclear-/\">deal</a>. The agreement aims&nbsp;to extend the time it would take for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, subjects some of Iran&rsquo;s major nuclear facilities to constant monitoring and creates conditions for lifting economic sanctions against Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wasserman Schultz <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article34232778.html\">announced</a> she would support the deal, saying that it wasn&rsquo;t perfect but that it &quot;promotes the national security interests of the United States and our allies and merits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his <a href=\"https://timcanova.com/issues\">website</a>, Canova doesn&rsquo;t say how he would have voted; however, he says that he would not support scrapping it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While I have criticized several deficiencies in the Iran nuclear deal (no international agreement is ever perfect), now that it has been entered into, I support its full implementation,&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canova has repeatedly <a href=\"https://timcanova.com/issues\">outlined </a>his <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4ozqk9/hi_reddit_im_tim_canova_im_challenging_debbie/\">criticisms</a> of the deal, including that Iran &quot;can simply mothball rather than destroy the centrifuges, thereby allowing them to restart a nuclear program for military use in the future.&quot; He also criticizes the inspection protocols and the relief of sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canova&rsquo;s most complete statements about his position on the Iran deal stem came in an interview with the<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/video/originals/news/fl-sun-sentinel-editorial-tim-canova-panel-20160805-video-premiumvideo.html\"><em>Sun Sentinel </em>editorial board</a> in August 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I expressed reservations and criticism about the Iran agreement,&quot; Canova said. &quot;Now that it has been adopted, I am for strict implementation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When interviewed by <em>Sentinel </em>reporter Anthony Man, Canova acknowledged that he had made some conflicting statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man: &quot;You earlier this year said that you would have voted for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canova: &quot;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been quoted both ways.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man: &quot;You told me you would have voted for it. Is that accurate?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canova: &quot;I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s accurate. Look, I&rsquo;m not going to sort of play that game. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how I would have voted because I wasn&rsquo;t sitting in the seat, but I do know I criticized some aspects of it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man: &quot;In January, you said the deal wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but you would have voted for it under the circumstances. You don&rsquo;t believe that anymore?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canova: &quot;I don&rsquo;t know if I would have voted for it. ... In a conversation when you called me at home you caught me off guard, I was a candidate for about a week. Did I say that? Maybe. I honestly don&rsquo;t know how I would have voted for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Editorial page editor Rosemary O&rsquo;Hara asked Canova, if the deal was on the table today, how he would have voted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canova: &quot;I don&rsquo;t know. ... I&rsquo;m not a member of Congress, I didn&rsquo;t have any kind of briefings the way Debbie Wasserman Schultz did, so I don&rsquo;t think it&#39;s fair for me to say I would have voted for it, (or) I would have voted against it. I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a debate on CBS4&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/08/14/facing-south-florida-debbie-wasserman-schultz-debates-tim-canova/\">Facing South Florida</a> on Aug. 14, host Jim DeFede asked Canova if he would have voted for or against the agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When the question is asked as a hypothetical -- would I have seen classified information -- that&rsquo;s when I have said who knows,&quot; Canova said. &quot;But quite frankly I can say right here that was not a good agreement for a couple reasons. First of all, Iran is the biggest funder of Hezbollah and Hamas, (and) to release $100 billion in assets (to Iran) right away without doing it incrementally is what I found to be dangerous and unsettling. And quite frankly, my position is the same as dozens of other Democrats who voted against the agreement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked for other statements Canova made about his own position on the Iran deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She voted for the Iran deal, and I&rsquo;m against the agreement,&quot; he told <em><a href=\"http://forward.com/news/341210/bernie-sanders-takes-feud-with-democratic-establishment-to-debbie-wasserman/#ixzz4D5JMv6ix\">The Forward</a></em> in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Bell, Canova&rsquo;s campaign manager, told PolitiFact Florida that<em> The Forward</em> doesn&rsquo;t fully explain his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Aug. 1, according to the <em>Times of Israel,</em> Canova told the <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/florida-dems-wasserman-schultzs-challenger-flip-flopping-on-iran-deal/\">Sunny Isles Beach Democratic Club</a>: &quot;I was critical of the Iran agreement. How would I have voted? I can&rsquo;t tell you, I wasn&rsquo;t a member of Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bell told PolitiFact Florida that Canova&rsquo;s position on the Iran nuclear agreement has been consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He is critical of specific aspects of the Iran deal,&quot; Bell said. &quot;Now that it&rsquo;s been adopted, he is for its full and strict implementation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We agree that Canova has been consistent in his criticisms and in <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/insurgency-on-the-left/article/2002277\">bashing</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sanders-breathes-life-into-a-florida-professors-unlikely-bid-to-oust-the-dnc-chair/2016/05/29/3c7b7a4c-2434-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">Wasserman Schultz </a>for supporting the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canova has acknowledged that he has &quot;been quoted both ways&quot; on how he would have voted the Iran deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said in January that he would have voted for it, but later in the campaign said multiple times that he didn&rsquo;t know how he would have voted.
