It's clear he is referring to an annual survey done by\n <em>\n  Overdrive\n </em>\n magazine (\"The voice of the American trucker\"), which asks truck drivers to name the best and worst highways.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Huckabee took office in 1996,\n <em>\n  Overdrive's\n </em>\n survey said Arkansas' roads were fifth worst in the United States. The state kept slipping in the rankings and by 2000 it was indeed the worst in the nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The shoddy highways persuaded the Arkansas Legislature to raise gasoline and diesel taxes in 1999, which paid for major repairs to the state's road network.\n</p>\n<p>\n That helped.\n</p>\n<p>\n By 2004, Arkansas was rated the state with the most improved roads in\n <em>\n  Overdrive's\n </em>\n annual survey.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 2006, Huckabee's last full year in office,\n <em>\n  Overdrive\n </em>\n did not do overall rankings for the states, so it's a stretch for him to say they were most improved \"when I left.\" However, the truckers that year listed Interstate 40 in Arkansas as the most improved road in the nation. Interstate 30 in Arkansas was No. 4 on the list.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet despite the improvement that occurred under Huckabee, the state's roads still rate near the bottom overall.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the January 2008 issue, Arkansas is rated fifth worst &ndash; the same as when Huckabee took office.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"They have done a lot of work,\" said Andy Duncan, a senior editor for the magazine. \"Nevertheless, the consensus is that they have a ways to go.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n And so while Huckabee is right that the state earned the honor for the most improved roads at one point in his term, it's a stretch to say that was the case when he left office. And Arkansas still lags behind other states. So we rate Huckabee's claim Mostly True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:27.019787", "ruling_date": "2008-01-11T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "The roads are better - but still rank near the bottom", "ruling_headline_slug": "the-roads-are-better-but-still-rank-near-th", "ruling_link_text": "The roads are better - but still rank near the bottom", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n Overdrive,\n <a href=\"http://www.etrucker.com/apps/news/article.asp?id=56766\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Rougher than a corncob,\n </a>\n December 2006\n</p>\n<p>\n Overdrive,\n <a href=\"http://digitalmagazinetechnology.com/magazineV2.0/?KEY=overdrive-08-01january&amp;title=Overdrive+January+08\" target=\"_blank\">\n  2007 Highway Report Card,\n </a>\n January 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Interviews: Todd Dills and Andy Duncan, Overdrive senior editor\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "author", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 9, "home_state": "Arkansas", "id": 16, "last_name": "Huckabee", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "mike-huckabee", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Mike_Huckabee.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/16/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 8, "website": "http://www.explorehuckabee.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\"I took on the worst road system in the country, according to Trucker's magazine.
