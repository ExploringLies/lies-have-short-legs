The experts also said there are likely more than just 15 examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The question was never asked,&quot; said Clifford Rosky, a law professor at the University of Utah. &quot;(Olson&rsquo;s) correct to say that they&rsquo;ve never specifically said marriage is just a man and a woman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, until the Supreme Court&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/26/us/annotated-supreme-court-decision-on-doma.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2013 decision</u></a> to strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensuring same-sex couples get the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. In this case, Rosky said, the court had to address the definition of marriage and said homosexual couples can be considered married.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until recent decades, some experts told us, the court likely assumed that when they said &quot;marriage,&quot; others would interpret that as meaning a heterosexual union, not a homosexual one, due to societal norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not a single one of these cases (in Olson&rsquo;s list) would have been assuming anything but opposite-sex marriage,&quot; said Michael Klarman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. &quot;Before the 1990s, virtually nobody took the idea of same-sex marriage seriously.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, states began revising their laws to have more gender-neutral language, which raised questions about whether marriages should be extended to same-sex marriages if statutes do not specify otherwise, said Martha Umphrey, a professor of American government at Amherst College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers Smith, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania, said other Supreme Court decisions show the tendency of justices to assume marriage means a heterosexual relationship. For example, they have sometimes linked the right to marry with the right to bear children. And in the 1961 case <em>Poe vs. Ullman</em>, Justice John Harlan argued that &quot;although the right to privacy protected rights of marital couples, it did not protect rights of homosexuals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perkins&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.frc.org/marriageontrial\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Family Research Council</u></a>, says the fact that the Supreme Court has tied the &quot;right to marry&quot; to procreation is proof that this right only applies to opposite sex couples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith added that the examples in Olson&rsquo;s list up to the 1960s tend to link marriage to the survival of the species and family life. But over time, the justices started to discuss the right to marry more as a right of all individuals and essential to human dignity and happiness. He said this reflects changing norms and makes denying same-sex couples the right to marry seem much more unreasonable than it would have in years past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Umphrey compared the current debate to that of interracial marriage. Until the years leading up to the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 1967 decision that interracial marriages should be legal, most people -- including the justices -- assumed marriage meant a union between two people of the same race. Still, the Supreme Court used its own prior comments on marriage as a &quot;fundamental right&quot; as precedent for its decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olson said, the &quot;Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said marriage is a fundamental right&quot; and never said &quot;it had to be between a man and a woman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olson provided a list of 15 cases that addressed marriage as something like a &quot;fundamental right&quot; that did not specify marriage as a union between a man and woman. Several experts backed up his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until recent years, though, the Supreme Court never had to address the question of whether or not marriage should be limited to a man and woman. Because of societal norms, they assumed that the decision would be interpreted as referring to a heterosexual relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Olson&rsquo;s claim is on point.
