Now, his brash words have pushed him to correct the political record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot; radio show May 24, the Republican presidential hopeful tried to rebut accusations that in March he said he would not appoint Muslims to Cabinet positions or federal judgeships in a potential Cain administration. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing,&quot; Cain told Beck. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis statement, made just three days after Cain&rsquo;s May 21 announcement that he is running for president, was only his latest attempt to put the controversy to rest. Reporters have dogged him on the issue for two months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;People are trying to push me in a corner,&quot; he groused in April to The Daily Caller, a news website founded by conservatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo one puts Herman Cain in a corner. But fact-check him? We can&rsquo;t resist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat did he say in March about appointing Muslims to his Cabinet?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called and emailed the Cain campaign for comment. It did not respond, so we proceeded without it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMetro Atlantans are accustomed to Cain as an agitator. He&rsquo;s been goading liberals for years as a conservative talk show host on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain&rsquo;s comments about Muslims barely made news locally, but with the growth of his support, he faces more scrutiny than ever before.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow we&rsquo;re learning whether what plays with metro Atlanta conservatives works on the national stage. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe controversy began in February in a Milner church. Cain talked about his bout with stage four liver and colon cancer and suggested he was uncomfortable when he learned his surgeon&rsquo;s name was &quot;Abdallah.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe evangelical publication Christianity Today asked Cain about his comment in a March 21 article. Cain replied that Muslims should stop trying to convert others.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them,&quot; Cain said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFive days later, a blogger for liberal ThinkProgress.org questioned him at the Conservative Principles Conference in Des Moines, Iowa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Would you be comfortable appointing a Muslim either in your Cabinet or as a federal judge?&quot; the blogger asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No, I will not,&quot; Cain replied. &quot;And here&rsquo;s why. There is this creeping attempt, there&rsquo;s this attempt to gradually ease Sharia law and the Muslim faith into our government. It does not belong in our government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy that Monday, Cain was explaining his comments to national media outlets. He&rsquo;s been at it ever since.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis brings us back to Beck&rsquo;s radio show, where Cain said his statement was &quot;misconstrued.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;[The reporter] said, would you be comfortable with a Muslim in your Cabinet?&quot; Cain told Beck. &quot;And I immediately said, without thinking, &lsquo;No, I would not be comfortable.&rsquo; I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing. &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the question the ThinkProgress.org blogger asked Cain was whether he would be &quot;comfortable&quot; with a Muslim in his Cabinet, not whether he would appoint one. If you take the video on its face, the explanation Cain gave on Beck&rsquo;s show seems reasonable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe problem is that it contradicts what Cain said about his own comments. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Monday after the news broke, Cain recounted what he said on Fox News&rsquo; &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A reporter asked me &lsquo;Would I appoint a Muslim to my administration?&rsquo; I did say &lsquo;no,&rsquo; &quot; Cain told Cavuto.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And here&rsquo;s why ... I would have to have people totally committed to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. And many of the Muslims, they&rsquo;re not totally dedicated to this country,&quot; he said. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn April, Cain repeated he would not hire a Muslim to radio host Bryan Fischer, who is also a conservative. We found an excerpt from the show on a website critical of the political right:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;[T]he comment I made that became controversial, and my staff keeps hoping will die, is that I wouldn&rsquo;t have Muslims in my administration. And it&rsquo;s real simple. The Constitution does not have room for Sharia law ... and to introduce that element as part of an administration when we&rsquo;ve got all of these other issues, I think I have the right to say that I won&rsquo;t,&quot; Cain said. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain&rsquo;s opposition to Muslims in his Cabinet is not ironclad. After some prodding, he told Cavuto he might consider a Muslim who&rsquo;s loyal to the Constitution but never met one he would choose for his Cabinet.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, contrary to his claim on Beck&rsquo;s program, Cain did say he would not have Muslims in his Cabinet. Not once or twice, but three times in as many weeks to ThinkProgress.org, Cavuto and Fischer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen scrutiny grew stronger, Cain backtracked. During Beck&rsquo;s program, he parted ways with the truth. The heat is on, and Cain&rsquo;s Pants are on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-07T16:40:29.122800", "ruling_date": "2011-06-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cain denies claims he said he would not appoint Muslims", "ruling_headline_slug": "cain-denies-claims-he-said-he-would-not-appoint-mu", "ruling_link_text": "Oh yes he did.
