The red bars indicate the tenure of Republican presidents George W. Bush and Trump, while the blue bars indicate the tenure of President Barack Obama, a Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s first problem is a straightforward factual inaccuracy. He said that &quot;right now,&quot; growth was 3.2 percent. However, the most recent growth number, for the first quarter of 2018, wasn&rsquo;t 3.2 percent. It was considerably lower, at 2.0 percent. (The next growth number, for the second quarter of 2018, won&rsquo;t be available for several more weeks.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Trump&rsquo;s watch, the U.S. did see one quarter of 3.2 percent growth -- the third quarter of 2017. By now, that data point is three quarters old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably, the bigger problem with Trump&rsquo;s assertion is the idea that &quot;nobody thought that was possible.&quot; Here, Trump is confusing 3 percent growth during a single quarter with 3 percent growth sustained over an entire year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to normal variations in the economy, meeting the 3 percent threshold for a quarter is not uncommon. But it has been almost a decade and a half since the U.S. economy grew at a 3 percent pace over an entire year.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As the chart shows, the last time the economy as a whole grew at 3 percent for an entire year was in 2005, when it grew at 3.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Economists do not expect a consistent 3 percent annual growth from the U.S. economy given our demographics and our current productivity numbers,&quot; said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/may/26/why-economists-are-skeptical-us-can-grow-3-percent/\">Read our more detailed explanation of economists&rsquo; reasoning</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, quarterly increases of 3 percent are not rare -- in fact, they happened eight times under Obama, including levels Trump has not yet reached, such as 4.6 percent (twice) and 5.2 percent (once).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one caveat to keep in mind is that Trump&rsquo;s task in expanding GDP rapidly is harder than it was for Obama, said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. That&rsquo;s because the recovery has been going for so long -- since June 2009 -- that the economy has less &quot;slack&quot; in it that could feed quick growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Experience shows that it is easier to see quarters with relatively rapid real GDP growth when the economy can grow both because of a growing working-age population and rising productivity and because many of the involuntarily unemployed are finding jobs,&quot; Burtless said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Watch those GDP numbers. We started off at a very low number, and right now we hit a 3.2 (percent). Nobody thought that was possible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is inaccurate two ways. First, the most recent saw GDP growth of 2.0 percent, not 3.2 percent. And second, exceeding 3 percent GDP growth in a quarter is not an unusual achievement -- Obama accomplished it eight times. The real achievement would be a full year at 3 percent, which hasn&rsquo;t happened under Trump yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-06-29T15:08:04.542387", "ruling_date": "2018-07-02T11:03:34", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump off-base in describing GDP growth on his watch", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-base-describing-gdp-growth-his-watch", "ruling_link_text": "Confuses monthly growth for yearly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-foxconn-facility/\">remarks in Mount Pleasant, Wis.</a>, June 28, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Economic Analysis, <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;step=2#reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;1921=survey&amp;1903=1\">Table 1.1.1</a>, accessed June 29, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/may/26/why-economists-are-skeptical-us-can-grow-3-percent/\">, &quot;Why economists are skeptical that U.S. can grow by 3 percent</a>,&quot; May 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist, June 29, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gary Burtless, Brookings Institution senior fellow, June 29, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Watch those GDP numbers.
