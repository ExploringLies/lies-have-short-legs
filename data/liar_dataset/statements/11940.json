When adjusted for inflation, the median Missouri family brought home $56,360 in 2014, down more than $5,000 from the median family income of $61,995 in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers support Richardson&rsquo;s statement. But the median income number jumps around a fair bit from year to year. If Richardson had chosen just slightly different starting and end points, the result could create a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in 1998, the median household income in Missouri was $58,355. And in 2013, Missouri&rsquo;s median household income was $47,601 &ndash; significantly lower than the statistic for 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Saku Aura, associate professor of Public Economics at the University of Missouri, said even with those ups and downs, the overall trend is not debatable. &quot;Missouri&rsquo;s economy has undoubtedly had very little to no positive growth in the last 15 years or so,&quot; Aura said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aura gave us a couple of reasons for the swings in median income. The Census Bureau sample is small and the margin of error can be over $3,000. And he also noted that family size has been edging down<strong>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If there are less people in each family, it would make sense that perhaps there is less money being earned.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to measure income is to look at the average per person. By that yardstick, personal income has increased over the past 15 years. But big gains by a relative few earners at the high end pull up the average in ways that don&rsquo;t reflect the typical person&rsquo;s experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Macintosh HD:Users:katiemoeller:Library:Containers:com.apple.mail:Data:Library:Mail Downloads:D8555B5F-68EE-4217-BF33-1DB403CEC995:0209PolitiFact.pdf\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yJgmc6UA7oxLHSFIltZ4fbdbUi_Pd6O-nIekGAWcJhJKj47VaP8XTQjZebZFuUIGNNRPKjevy5PUv7L0qKQjoxMNEZoMF6vy_LHGzAfAUn4VjvdHKun6zS8Hh27YRyVJ7yGAW9P2376zkLZmfQ\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:404px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:350px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a trend we&rsquo;ve seen across the country almost since the &lsquo;70s,&quot; Aura said. &quot;Most economic growth comes for the highest quartile, not the middle class or poorer families.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richardson largely got his numbers right when he said that Missouri&rsquo;s families&rsquo; &quot;earning power is less today than it was at the start of the century.&quot; &nbsp;While his exact numbers could be off, the general trend holds up.
