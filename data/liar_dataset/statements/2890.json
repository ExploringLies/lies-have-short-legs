Bob McDonnell that a Virginia Tech student had called to complain about the rising cost of tuition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And he should,&quot; McDonnell responded. &quot;I have a daughter at Virginia Tech and two (sons) at U.Va. right now and I&rsquo;m saying I understand his pain. The tuitions in Virginia colleges, Mark, have doubled -- 100 percent -- in the last 10 years. It&rsquo;s unacceptable.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t challenge the governor on where his children are enrolled, but we did wonder whether tuition at all state schools had doubled.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell Press Secretary Stacey Johnson supported the claim with a July State Council of Higher Education for Virginia report. She pointed to a chart showing the average full-time in-state undergraduate tuition with mandatory teaching-related fees has risen from $2,192 in 2000-01 to $5,670 for 2010-11 -- significantly more than double.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we wondered if each public college and university had doubled its tuition over the decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we turn back to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia&rsquo;s report, which clearly shows that tuition and fees are on the rise. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor 2010-11, all of the state&rsquo;s 16 public schools show undergraduate tuition and mandatory teaching-related fees increasing by at least 5 percent from the previous year. Half of those increases are in the double digits, with Virginia Commonwealth University at the top of the list with a 23.9 percent hike from 2009-10. Old Dominion University had the smallest increase at 5.3 percent. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, we need to see how things looked a decade ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a 2000-01 State Council of Higher Education report, McDonnell&rsquo;s claim still holds up if we look at all the state&rsquo;s public four-year institutions. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly Richard Bland College -- a two-year junior college -- has not doubled its tuition, and even that school is only $256 shy of the mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe only way McDonnell&rsquo;s claim runs into trouble is if we look at tuition and all mandatory fees -- for non-instructional uses such as athletics and capital debt service. Even then, only two schools -- James Madison University and Old Dominion University -- have yet to double the 2000-01 figures, and both are short by less than $200.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn case you&rsquo;re curious, the average tuition including all mandatory fees and room and board for four-year state schools has risen from $8,813 in 2000-01 to $16,833 this year -- nearly double. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso of note: Tuition spiked sharply in fiscal 2002 after a tuition freeze instituted in fiscal 1997 was lifted. A mandatory tuition reduction was also implemented in fiscal 2000. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The freeze was lifted in Fiscal Year &lsquo;02 because of budget cuts to higher education. That&#39;s when tuition and E&amp;G &nbsp;(instructional) fees shot up by an average of 21.5 percent across the public institutions,&quot; said Kirsten Nelson with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore recent spikes were also caused by budget cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The reasons they have gone up fairly substantially in the past couple years is because they&rsquo;ve suffered budget cuts from the General Assembly,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;One of the reasons that higher education gets cut is because the institutions have an alternate source of income, which is tuition.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson said things could have been worse were it not for the almost $275 million state colleges and universities received from the 2009 Stimulus Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s review:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell&rsquo;s claim that Virginia tuition has doubled in the last 10 years is 100 percent true using the average. If we look individually at each of the state&rsquo;s four-year schools, it&rsquo;s still true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly if we include Richard Bland, the state&rsquo;s only two-year junior college, is it not entirely true to say that all state colleges and universities have doubled tuition, but even then it&rsquo;s off just a tad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we find the claim to be True.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-02T11:25:44.439163", "ruling_date": "2010-12-02T11:35:22", "ruling_headline": "Bob McDonnell says Virginia college tuitions have doubled in 10 years ", "ruling_headline_slug": "bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-college-tuitions-have-", "ruling_link_text": "With three kids in college, he knows the facts.
