Also, McDonald writes, voter registration rolls include double entries because the records don&rsquo;t always catch up to voters changing residences and they often list voters who have left the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Americans could vote but don&rsquo;t bother to register. Al Jazeera America <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/11/5/why-the-real-electionturnoutwasfarlowerthanreported.html#alabama\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reported</u></a> on Nov. 5, 2014, that 70 million Americans who qualified to vote did not register for the 2014 election and, hence, were excluded from voter turnout calculations based on the share of registered voters who cast ballots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his analysis of each state, McDonald said, he reached his turnout estimates by considering the number of votes cast in the statewide race generating the highest participation -- which in Texas was the governor&rsquo;s race (also the race used by the Texas Secretary of State to calculate turnout, office spokeswoman Alicia Pierce told us by phone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, <em>Observer </em>reporter Stephen Young told us he declared Texas&rsquo; voter turnout the nation&rsquo;s lowest for the year because that appears to hold for<strong> </strong>the 36 states that had <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/2014-election/results/map/governor/#.VG9oZWcdiAo\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>gubernatorial elections</u></a>, which he said draw more voters in non-presidential election years than balloting in states lacking those marquee races. Indiana (the state with lower turnout than Texas) was among the 14 states lacking a vote for governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Calculating voter turnout</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research showed there is no universally agreed-upon method of calculating voter turnout. <a href=\"http://www.texasalmanac.com/sites/default/files/images/topics/prezturnout.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Some</u></a> <a href=\"http://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/vce/features/0302_01/turnout.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>groups</u></a> use a state&rsquo;s voting-age population to determine turnout; others, like the Elections Project and the Census Bureau, start from adults eligible to vote by estimating and subtracting adults legally ineligible to vote including felons and non-citizens. Others, like <a href=\"http://www.ncsbe.gov/ncsbe/voter-turnout\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>many</u></a> <a href=\"http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/current/Turnout.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>state</u></a> <a href=\"http://sos.mt.gov/elections/Voter_Turnout/index.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>governments</u></a>, calculate the portion of registered voters who voted in a given race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Page/990-050%20EAC%20VoterSurvey_508Compliant.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2012 survey</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. Election Assistance Commission</u></a>,<strong> </strong>an independent clearinghouse of elections information, asked each state to report its voting statistics.<strong> </strong>The EAC compiled the responses and ranked Texas 47th in turnout among voting-age citizens (ahead of West Virginia, Hawaii, New Mexico and Mississippi).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A wrinkle to consider when talking turnout is that voters participate in voting for some offices more than others. Of Texas&rsquo; 14,025,441 registered voters as of November 2014, about 4.7 million voters participated in the gubernatorial election while about 4.6 million made a choice in the race for U.S. senator (even though it topped the ballot);<strong> </strong>down the ballot, a little more than 3.7 million votes were cast for one of the Texas Supreme Court<strong> </strong>seats, <a href=\"https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/nov04_175_state.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to</u></a><strong> </strong>unofficial results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, the Texas Secretary of State <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/historical/70-92.shtml\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reports</u></a> the turnout of registered voters and turnout of the voting-age population<strong>, </strong>though the state has yet to calculate the latter figure for the 2014 elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Strauss Institute report was based on census bureau <a href=\"http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/TheDataWeb_HotReport2/voting/cache/683CD1444A5BB1FF71F4B9D31059D513.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>data</u></a> gathered by a phone survey in which residents were asked questions to determine if they were eligible to vote, then were asked if they&rsquo;d voted. The report said: &quot;While other ways of measuring voting rates are available, each calculates the &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; population&mdash;the denominator in the fraction&mdash;differently.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked McDonald precisely how he whittles Census Bureau population estimates down to the estimated number of adults eligible to vote in each state and then how he quickly establishes turnout percentages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, McDonald said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-He begins with the voting-age population and subtracts population estimates for demographics that are ineligible to vote, like felons and non-citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-He calculates each state&rsquo;s number of eligible voters in the months before an election, then uses vote counts reported by the Associated Press after election night and historical data from past elections to call voter turnout before all votes are counted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-He cautions that no turnout numbers will be official until states report total ballots cast to the Election Assistance Commission--probably by late 2015--so for now, the Texas numbers are an estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Independent confirmation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sought to compare the Elections Project estimates of voter turnout with other analyses, nearly coming up empty. Officials with groups we queried--the Pew Research Center, the Voter Participation Project, the Election Assistance Commission and the Texas Tribune--said they relied on the project&rsquo;s figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Curtis Gans,<strong> </strong>who has led the <a href=\"http://www.american.edu/spa/cdem/csae.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Center for the Study of the American Electorate</u></a> at American University in Washington, D.C, since <a href=\"http://www.archives.nd.edu/Observer/1976-11-04_v11_041.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>at least 1976</u></a>, told us preliminary data collected by the center for 2014 didn&rsquo;t conclusively show Texas, which hasn&rsquo;t yet finished counting ballots, would have the nation&rsquo;s worst voter turnout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Texas has been near the bottom for many years, but I&rsquo;m not sure if<strong> </strong>it&rsquo;s at the bottom this year,&quot; Gans said. &quot;In any case, it will be near the bottom.&quot; He said the center would release its voter turnout data within weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said other states with historically low turnout, like New York and California, also haven&rsquo;t finished counting ballots. As of Nov. 7, 2014, three days after the elections, the Elections Project said, 31.8 percent of California&rsquo;s 24,408,163 eligible-to-vote citizens had turned out for the 2014 election, while 28.8 percent of New York&rsquo;s 13,563,172 had voted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stanford said that in November 2014, &quot;Texas had the worst voter participation in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the respected Elections Project, Texas appears to have had the lowest voter participation among states with a governor&rsquo;s race. Among all states, though, Indiana appears to have had lower turnout--and besides, voting statistics aren&rsquo;t final.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Stanford&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong> </em><em>&ndash;
