Charlene Lima, a Cranston Democrat.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn her speech on the House floor, carried live on television, she spoke of the &quot;fiercely independent&quot; history of Rhode Island and offered this example: &quot;We didn&#39;t ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn&#39;t even have to pay federal income taxes. We never ratified that.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Rhode Island did a double-take.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we don&#39;t have to pay our federal income taxes?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore we wrote to the government to demand a big refund, we called Lima.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we couldn&#39;t get through to her right away, we checked some history.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt turns out that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">13th Amendment</a> abolished slavery. It had nothing to do with the federal income tax.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRhode Island not only ratified that amendment, we were the second state to do so, on Feb. 2, 1865.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe amendment that created the federal income tax was the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">16th Amendment</a>. It was ratified by 42 of the 48 states in 1911, 1912 and 1913. (Alaska and Hawaii were not states at the time). Rhode Island rejected it, so Lima is correct about that element of her statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen we got to the big question: If Rhode Island didn&#39;t ratify it, is Lima correct to say that Rhode Islanders don&#39;t have to pay income taxes?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNo more than Mississippi residents could continue to own slaves after it rejected the 13th Amendment in 1865. (It would take Mississippi another 130 years to formally approve that amendment.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLima&#39;s statement &quot;is wrong in so many different ways,&quot; said <a href=\"http://law.rwu.edu/jared-goldstein\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Jared Goldstein</a>, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the issue of paying taxes, the fact that Rhode Island did not ratify the 16th Amendment &quot;does not matter in the least,&quot; he said. &quot;Under the Constitution, an amendment becomes part of the Constitution upon the ratification by three-quarters of the states. Under the Supremacy Clause, the U.S. Constitution trumps any contrary state law, which means that states are bound by the Constitution regardless of whether they ratified every part of it. Otherwise, each state would only be bound by the parts of the Constitution that it agrees with, and there would be chaos.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo it doesn&#39;t look as if we&#39;re going to get that refund.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we heard back from Lima, she said she might have named the wrong amendment, she does pay her federal income taxes and &quot;I think people have to pay them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe said her comment was &quot;kinda more tongue in cheek.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter her statement on the House floor, she said, the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Helio Melo approached her. &quot;He said, &#39;I wanted to get up on the floor and say, Don&#39;t listen to Rep. Lima,&#39;&quot; Lima said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn this issue, we agree.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRep. Charlene Lima had the wrong amendment and the wrong lesson from history when she said Rhode Island &quot;didn&#39;t ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn&#39;t even have to pay federal income taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause her statement falls into the realm of ridiculous, we rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Pants on Fire</a>!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
