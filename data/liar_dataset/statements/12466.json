He said it on April 29 at the state&rsquo;s Republican Party Convention when he was <em>on pace</em> to break the record but was still short at the time.

Bush&rsquo;s previous mark set in 2000, which tallied 11.54 million direct primary and caucus votes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign had not responded to a request for comment as of Wednesday night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining contests include California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, all on June 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ostermeier is not the only one tracking vote tallies. <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/republican_vote_count.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>RealClearPolitics.com</u></a> shows Trump at 11.53 million popular votes -- slightly behind Bush&rsquo;s 2000 vote total, certainly not &quot;millions&quot; ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s 2016 vote count has benefitted, Ostermeier said, from a larger national population, a more competitive race and from lasting nearly two months longer than Bush&rsquo;s contest against Arizona Sen. John McCain. Ostermeier added that Trump also &quot;lost votes&quot; to this year&rsquo;s crowded field of GOP candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said he&rsquo;s broken &quot;by millions&quot; the record for GOP&nbsp;presidential primary votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With victories on June 7th, including in California, he may well smash the record. &nbsp;But he&rsquo;s not there yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim False again &hellip; for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(63, 99, 158); transition: color 0.15s ease-in-out, border 0.15s ease-in-out; text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(63, 99, 158); transition: color 0.15s ease-in-out, border 0.15s ease-in-out; text-decoration: none;\">more</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(63, 99, 158); transition: color 0.15s ease-in-out, border 0.15s ease-in-out; text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e69aa63-1805-4e12-87c5-4c8a5f49be9a\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e69aa63-1805-4e12-87c5-4c8a5f49be9a</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-02T01:13:59.349648", "ruling_date": "2016-06-01T22:23:35", "ruling_headline": "No, Donald Trump.
