Tillerson&rsquo;s lawyer also <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304899704579391181466603804\">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that Tillerson himself cared the most about property devaluation.

The tower would, in part, supply water for hydraulic fracturing &mdash; which injects pressurized water as well as sand and chemicals under shale rock formations to extract natural gas. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lawsuit contended the project violates the town&rsquo;s zoning ordinance and will also be an &quot;unbearable nuisance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A water tower will have lights on at all hours of the night, traffic to and from the tower at unknown and unreasonable hours, noise from mechanical and electrical equipment needed to maintain and operate the water tower, and creates and (sic) unsafe and unattractive nuisance to the children of the area,&quot; the suit <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/water20140220.pdf\">reads</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Furthermore, upon information and belief, (the Bartonville Water Supply Corporation) will sell water to oil and gas explorers for fracing shale formations leading to traffic with heavy trucks on FM 407, creating a noise nuisance and traffic hazards,&quot; it continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to joining the lawsuit, Tillerson sat for a three-hour deposition in May 2013 and protested the project at a town council meeting that November, according to the <em>Journal&rsquo;s </em>report in February 2014. But the newspaper noted that Tillerson wasn&rsquo;t &quot;the most vocal or well-known opponent of the tower.&quot; That distinction belonged to the lead plaintiffs, former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Environmentalists jumped on the story, with plenty pointing out the irony and hypocrisy but embracing Tillerson into their ranks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A former oil executive penned an open <a href=\"http://www.nofrackingway.us/2014/02/26/lou-allstadt-letter-to-rex-tillerson/\">letter</a> to Tillerson on NoFrackingWay.Us decrying the environmental impacts of the practice and wishing him &quot;good luck with that fracking water tank.&quot; Credo Action, an online hub of progressive activists, dubbed Tillerson <a href=\"http://act.credoaction.com/sign/rex_tillerson_fracking\">&quot;the highest-profile anti-fracking activist in the world.</a>&quot; And MoveOn.org offered Tillerson its <a href=\"http://front.moveon.org/in-wake-of-exxon-ceos-lawsuit-against-local-fracking-infrastructure-moveon-org-offers-tillerson-frackingfighter-award-to-help-stop-fracking-in-his-community/#.WFGwH1MrK70\">&quot;FrackingFighter&quot; award</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under pressure and after a judge dismissed the claims, Tillerson dropped out of the lawsuit two months later in April 2014, the <em>Dallas Business Journal </em><a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2014/04/21/rex-tillerson-dropsout-of-water-tower-lawsuit-in.html\">reported</a>.
