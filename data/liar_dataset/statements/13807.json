The post includes a reference to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/us/politics/stephen-bannon-trump-campaign.html\">real charges Bannon faced in 1996</a>, when his then-wife Mary Louise Piccard accused him of domestic abuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness. Those charges were <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-case-police-report-227432\">dropped in August 1996</a> when Piccard did not appear in court. The couple divorced in 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post cites a Politico interview (which is fake), quoting Bannon as saying that marriage is great because &quot;you get to do all the things you&rsquo;re not supposed to in a relationship.&quot; The quote isn&rsquo;t worded the same way as the headline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And just like there&rsquo;s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you&rsquo;re doing it out of love,&quot; Bannon is quoted as saying. &quot;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don&rsquo;t mean that in everyday life. I&rsquo;m talking about when they&rsquo;re performing their marital duties.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, Bannon did not say these things. They&rsquo;re made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com, which <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/22/blog-posting/mega-pastor-john-hagee-wants-jail-women-who-use-go/\">we&rsquo;ve written about</a> before, <a href=\"http://uspoln.com/contact/\">identifies itself</a> as &quot;a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.&quot; The domain is registered to an <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/uspoln.com\">address in Kosovo</a>. The site didn&rsquo;t respond to our attempts to contact them via email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the story actually comes from yet another joke site, in an <a href=\"http://politicops.com/stephen-bannon-nobody-can-blame-beating-wife-love/\">Aug. 26, 2016, post</a> on Politicops.com. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which <a href=\"http://politicops.com/about-us/\">refers to itself in a disclaimer</a> as &quot;the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same story also appears on <a href=\"http://politicalo.com/stephen-bannon-nobody-can-blame-beating-wife-love/\">other sites in</a> <a href=\"http://politicot.com/stephen-bannon-nobody-can-blame-beating-wife-love/\">the Newslo family</a>, like Politicalo.com and Politicot.com. The articles were posted the day after stories recounting Bannon&rsquo;s 1996 ran in outlets like <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/steve-bannon-domestic-violence-case-police-report-227432\">Politico</a> and the <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/us/politics/stephen-bannon-trump-campaign.html\">New York Times</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newslo.com stories take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them.
