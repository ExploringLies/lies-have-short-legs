Is he halfway there in deporting thousands of MS-13 gang members?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The latest data shows immigration officials have deported 2,798 gang members in fiscal year 2017 &mdash; that&rsquo;s members of all gangs and includes several months when former President Barack Obama was in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">MS-13 in the United States</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s June 28 remarks weren&rsquo;t the first he&rsquo;s made about MS-13 and his administration&rsquo;s efforts against them. At a rally this month in Iowa, he <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jun/22/fact-checking-nine-things-trump-overstated-got-wro/\">told supporters</a> his administration was &quot;moving them out of the country by the thousands.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, he <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/18/donald-trump/trump-falsely-claims-obama-policies-blame-growth-m/\">falsely</a> tweeted that Obama&rsquo;s policies allowed MS-13 to form across the United States, and again that his administration was removing them fast. But multiple experts told us there is no evidence Obama&rsquo;s policies caused the gang&rsquo;s growth in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000 members worldwide, the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/958481/download\">said</a> in an April 18, 2017, fact sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to peg down exactly how many MS-13 gang members there are in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s Justice Department in April <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/958481/download\">said</a> there were more than 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. FactCheck.org <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/ms-13-gang-nonsense/\">noted</a> that for years the 10,000 figure has been a consistent estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">MS-13 deportations under Trump</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the White House for evidence backing Trump&rsquo;s claim, but did not get an on-the-record response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A specific number of MS-13 gang members deported is not available because <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jun/22/fact-checking-nine-things-trump-overstated-got-wro/\">officials don&rsquo;t track removals by specific gang</a>, Dani Bennett, spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement previously told us. (The FBI <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/gangs\">says</a> there&rsquo;s around 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs criminally active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico &mdash; with an estimated 1.4 million members.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ICE &quot;does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations,&quot; Bennett said, adding that deportations include foreign fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad and who are removable under U.S. immigration law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far in fiscal year 2017, ICE said it has removed 2,798 gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if all of them were MS-13 gang members, that would still be short of Trump&rsquo;s claim that &quot;we&#39;re pretty much at the 50 percent mark&quot; &mdash; since the Justice Department in April said there&rsquo;s an estimated 10,000 gang members in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;We&#39;re pretty much at the 50 percent mark&quot; on deportations of MS-13 gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s Justice Department has said there&rsquo;s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest available data from ICE shows 2,798 gang members have been removed in fiscal year 2017. But that includes members of all gangs, not just MS-13. Even if all were MS-13, that would not be half of the estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the country. And fiscal year 2017 includes more than three months that Obama was in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s statement is not accurate.
