So, one thing to make clear upfront is that in his Wisconsin remarks, the president singled out wages -- the paycheck you get from your job. That&rsquo;s a narrower category than income, which can include money taken in from other sources such as investments or government benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked for evidence to back the president&rsquo;s wages claim, a White House spokesman cited <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswktabs.htm\"><u>a database</u></a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows the median weekly earnings for full-time workers in the final quarter of each year from 1999 through 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The median wage means half of workers earned more than that amount and half earned less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the database, we assembled the following table.
