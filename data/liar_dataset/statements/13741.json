It simply measures consistency in positions over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some argue a change demonstrates an openness to new facts or a willingness to compromise. Others say it is evidence of inconsistent principles or lack of backbone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, where does Holtz stand?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz is a former Wisconsin principal of the year at Peshtigo Elementary School. He served 13 years as a school district administrator in the Palmyra, Beloit and Whitnall districts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was running Whitnall in 2010 when Evers determined to put Common Core in place in Wisconsin after the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices led the drafting process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, a CNI NOW newspaper story quoted Holtz saying he supported the standards. Holtz told the publication the standards concentrate on facts as related to real life rather than the traditional straight ahead factual approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, the same publication quoted Holtz this way:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The change is absolutely in the best interests of the kids of Wisconsin. Raising the bar will make our kids more competitive not only at the state level but at the national level.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He called it a &quot;fun, exciting time to be involved in education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By July 2016, when he announced his bid, it was clear Holtz was taking a different tack. He stressed local control and said Common Core was not necessarily effective because each community is different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beloitdailynews.com/archive/article-d0cdd42c-484e-11e6-9c03-ef6486d8a255.html\">The Beloit Daily News quoted Holtz</a> as saying the Common Core must be fought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Happy to be part of a panel discussing Education Reform and the dangers of Common Core,&quot; he tweeted in November 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz explained the switch in a Feb. 6, 2017 <a href=\"http://www.kidservative.org/holtz-outlines-plan-to-immediately-eliminate-common-core-in-wisconsin/\">blog post</a> about his plan to work with the governor and legislators to wipe out Common Core if elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State and school leaders, he said, were misled through &quot;high pressure marketing&quot; to adopt Common Core at the risk of politicizing curriculum decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His new position won support from conservatives including former state Rep. Don Pridemore, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully in 2013 for state school superintendent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Dr. Holtz will fight for local control and against Federal takeover programs like Common Core,&quot; Pridemore is quoted on Holtz&rsquo;s campaign <a href=\"http://www.kidservative.org/\">web site</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz campaign spokesman Brit Schiel acknowledged that Holtz&rsquo;s position has changed. He said it had evolved in line with Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated as a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/16/scott-walker/scott-walkers-shifting-position-common-core-educat/\">Half Flip</a> Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s change in position to oppose Common Core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During most of his first term, the governor showed tacit support. By mid-2013, he was hitting the pause button on further implementation of the standards. In mid-2014, Walker called for an outright repeal. But by January 2015, he was saying only that he didn&rsquo;t want school districts required to use Common Core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz, Schiel said, &quot;grew uncomfortable with Common Core&rsquo;s inefficiencies, its one-size-fits-all approach to education, and the fact that the standards were coming from Washington, not from the local school boards.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz definitely was for Common Core before he was against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change is stark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This major reversal of position merits a Full Flop.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\">\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">Politifact</a></div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com/mediapage/jpgs/politifact-logo-big.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\">\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">8</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">6</div>\r\n<img alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/fom-fullflop-pf.jpg\" style=\"display:none\" /> Politifact Rating:\r\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\">On using the Common Core standards for English and math instruction</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>Lowell Holtz</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Wisconsin state school superintendent candidate</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<img src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT__Holtz.jpg\" style=\"display:none\" />\r\n<div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\">In a campaign statement</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Thursday, February 2, 2017</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display: none;\">02/02/2017</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/15/lowell-holtz/holtz-turned-around-common-core-standards/\">Read More</a>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: right\"><a href=\"#\">info</a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-14T12:15:49.566052", "ruling_date": "2017-02-15T05:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Holtz turned around on Common Core standards", "ruling_headline_slug": "holtz-turned-around-common-core-standards", "ruling_link_text": "Praised it, now pans it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Tom McCarthy, spokesman, Department of Public Instruction, Feb. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Briton Schiel, spokesman, Holtz campaign, Feb. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holtz campaign blog post, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kidservative.org/holtz-outlines-plan-to-immediately-eliminate-common-core-in-wisconsin/\">Holtz Outlines Plan to Immediately Eliminate Common Core in Wisconsin</a>, Feb. 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beloit Daily News, <a href=\"http://www.beloitdailynews.com/archive/article-d0cdd42c-484e-11e6-9c03-ef6486d8a255.html\">&quot;Ex Beloit Superintendent Will Run for State Position,&quot;</a> July 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Wisconsin Now, <a href=\"http://onewisconsinnow.org/press/lowell-holtz-going-flip-for-flop-with-john-humphries-in-race-for-state-superintendent-of-public-instruction/\">press release</a>, Jan. 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Wisconsin Now, <a href=\"http://onewisconsinnow.org/press/john-humphries-takes-all-sides-on-school-funding-issue/\">press release</a>, Feb. 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNI NOW, &nbsp;&quot;Whitnall shares WKCE reality/Proficiency tumble is shared by other districts in state due to new higher standards,&quot; May 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNI NOW, &quot;Whitnall gets a later start, but that wasn&#39;t an issue/Rather, early dismissal will cause some headaches, January 26, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/16/scott-walker/scott-walkers-shifting-position-common-core-educat/\">Flip-O-Meter item</a> on Gov.
