Kamala Harris has condemned President Donald Trump on numerous occasions. Recently, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/1018902355431944192\">called out</a> Trump for not standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Not long ago, she <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KamalaHarris/posts/10156929894387923\">denounced</a> his administration&rsquo;s handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Harris, who has been mentioned as a potential <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/07/06/the-top-15-democratic-presidential-candidates-for-2020-ranked-3/?utm_term=.ec9d72ff9b25\">2020 presidential candidate</a>, has saved some of her sharpest criticism for Trump&rsquo;s policy that separated thousands of migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border this spring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every single day these families are separated, another child goes to sleep terrified because they don&rsquo;t know where their parents are,&quot; Harris <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KamalaHarris/posts/10156934714347923\">wrote</a> in a recent Facebook post. &quot;All because of a policy used to punish immigrants fleeing violence. This is not reflective of a civil society.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a different <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KamalaHarris/posts/10156932174332923\">post</a>, she wrote that &quot;these children are in prison.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, Harris and two other Democratic senators introduced the <a href=\"https://www.harris.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/REUNITE%20Act.pdf\">Reunite Act</a> during a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKamalaHarris/videos/735319510144518/\">press conference</a> at the U.S. Capitol. The bill would require the immediate reunification of families along with access to legal counsel and child advocates for those who have been separated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said the legislation is necessary to reunify the many children still separated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s talk about the facts and where we are today: There are still nearly 2,600 children who are separated from their parents,&quot; Harris said on July 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The separations stem from Trump&rsquo;s &quot;zero-tolerance&quot; policy calling for the prosecution of all immigrants who illegally crossed into the United States at the southwest border. Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-announces-zero-tolerance-policy-criminal-illegal-entry?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">announced</a> <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1049751/download\">the policy</a> April 6 as a deterrent to illegal immigration. Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/06/20/622095441/trump-executive-order-on-family-separation-what-it-does-and-doesnt-do\">executive order to end</a> family separations on June 20 after a backlash against that part of his policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know, weeks after the Trump administration ended that policy, did Harris get her numbers right on how many children remain separated?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/11884644/061818ImmigrationFamilySeparation-p.jpg\" style=\"height:1500px; width:2000px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In this June 1, 2018, file photo, children hold signs during a demonstration against the Trump administration&#39;s family separation policy in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices in Miramar, Fla.&nbsp;Wilfredo Lee / AP Photo</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for evidence, Harris&rsquo; spokesman pointed to testimony in a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/384260468/107-1-Ms-L-Status-Report-Meekins-Declaration\">July 13 court filing</a>&nbsp;from Chris Meekins, the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meekins testified that 2,551 separated children ages five and up remained in the agency&rsquo;s custody. Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/13/trump-administration-family-separations-reunifications-722196\">reported</a> it was the first time the Trump administration had specified the exact number of separated children. It added the &quot;health department earlier had estimated only that &lsquo;under 3,000 children&rsquo; were separated from their parents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One week ago, HHS reported it had <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/07/12/trump-administration-completes-reunification-for-eligible-children-under-age-5.html\">reunited 57 of 103 children</a> under the age of five with their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding those remaining young children, 46 as of last week, with the 2,551 children ages five and up, fits with Harris&rsquo; statement that &quot;nearly 2,600&quot; children remained separated as of mid-July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump administration said late last week it would speed up the reunification process. But it&rsquo;s not clear whether that&rsquo;s resulted in a major change this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An HHS spokeswoman on July 19 said she could not immediately provide a current figure for the total number of children that remain separated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/07/18/the-trump-administration-plan-for-reunifying-children.html\">press release</a> on the agency&rsquo;s website says HHS and other federal agencies are &quot;working rapidly&quot; to reunify eligible children with their parents under the orders of a U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw of San Diego.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HHS is facing a July 26 court-ordered deadline to reunify all the children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not all children will be reunified</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a family reunification report issued this week, HHS said the 2,551 figure &quot;represents the total possible 5-and-up cohort of minors who could be subject to the court order. Based on past experience, it is likely to include a significant number of minors who are not eligible for reunification under the court&rsquo;s order. Not all of the 2,551 minors in HHS care will necessarily be reunified, because some adults claiming parentage may not actually be the parents or may be unfit or a danger to the children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Kamala Harris claimed there &quot;are still nearly 2,600 children who are separated from their parents,&quot; speaking on July 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Trump administration official testified four days earlier that 2,551 children ages 5 and up remained separated. That figure along with the 46 youngest children that the administration said remained separated as of mid July equates to &quot;nearly 2,600.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department could not provide a current total this week for the number of remaining separated children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Harris appears to have accurately described the total based on the publicly available information at the time of her statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>UPDATE: After we published on July 19, 2018, and two days after Harris&#39; statement, the Trump administration updated its figures, saying&nbsp;364 of 2,551 children age five&nbsp;and older had been reunified with their parents, according to <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/sd-me-reunification-update-20180719-story.html\">news reports</a>.
