Joint Committee on Taxation, which is staffed by <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/about-us/overview.html\">independent</a> professionals. That&rsquo;s the value over 10 years (2017 through 2026) of repealing <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/07/health-bills-tax-cuts-worth-600-billion-mostly-corporations-and-rich/98866386/\">nearly all</a> the taxes contained in Obamacare and making other tax changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To evaluate Pocan&rsquo;s characterization of the $600 billion, we relied on <a href=\"http://www.crfb.org/blogs/jct-aca-repeal-will-cut-taxes-least-600-billion\">analyses</a> <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/house-gops-proposals-repeal-aca-taxes-would-largely-benefit-high-income-households\">done by</a> two expert nonprofit organizations -- the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Tax Policy Center.

And more than 99 percent of people would get no benefit from repeal of the Medicare surtax, while those in the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/repealing-affordable-care-act-would-cut-taxes-high-income-households-raise-taxes-many-others\">top 1 percent</a> would get three-quarters of the benefit&mdash;an average tax cut of $7,300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the $600 billion can be broken into two categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>$190 billion to businesses by repealing three taxes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>$145 billion: <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4982\">A tax</a> on health insurance companies based on their market share.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>$25 billion: <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-03-07/house-gop-health-bill-adds-up-to-big-tax-cut-for-the-rich\">Annual fee</a> paid by prescription drugmakers and importers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>$20 billion: <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-03-07/house-gop-health-bill-adds-up-to-big-tax-cut-for-the-rich\">A 2.3 percent excise tax</a> on medical device makers and importers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Both <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/author/howard-gleckman\">Howard Gleckman</a> of the Tax Policy Center and <a href=\"http://crfb.org/biography/marc-goldwein\">Marc Goldwein</a> of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us these are a mixed bag.
