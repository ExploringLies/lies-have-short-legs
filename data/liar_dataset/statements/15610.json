(<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">Read more</a> about our partnership with Facebook.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Fake text</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the city about it, a health department spokeswoman Carolina Rodriguez said, &quot;The only giant mutant rat in New York City is Master Splinter, and we all know he is partial to pizza just like another famous New York City rat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/42afJcK.gif?noredirect\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>She explained that most rats in the city are Norway rats, which grow between 12 to 18 inches, with 5- to 6-inch tails. At most, they weigh about a pound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Rodriguez, the health department has not received any reports of rat attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Fake Pics</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This article also includes three pictures, all of which are gross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first picture shows seven huge rats, laying dead on a table. When reverse-image searched, this photograph can be traced back to a <a href=\"https://www.natgeotv.com/za/invaders/galleries/giant-swamp-ants\">National Geographic photo gallery</a> on giant swamp rats. Also known as <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/n/nutria/\">nutrias</a>, these rodents weigh about 17 pounds and have been introduced to coastal regions in the United States. In Louisiana, they&rsquo;ve become so prevalent that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/31/louisiana-swamp-rat-hunters-rodents-of-unusual-size\">the government will pay hunters $5 per kill</a> in an attempt to prevent overgrazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These rodents do not live in New York, and they are unlikely to ever make the move. A <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268806352_Distribution_spread_and_habitat_preferences_of_nutria_Myocastor_coypus_invading_the_lower_Nakdong_River_South_Korea\">2014 study</a> shows that nutrias prefer warmer climates, where only a few days per year are lower than 24 degrees Fahrenheit. New York&rsquo;s sewer systems certainly don&rsquo;t fit the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image is reposted a second time within the article, although this time altered to make it appear that it was broadcast on the news. A breaking news runner gives the image an authentic look, but the fake &quot;5 NEWS&quot; logo and the &quot;smhwtfnews.com&quot; link make it clear that the screenshot was fabricated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third image, in which a man in a green shirt appears to be holding a giant rat, is an old internet hoax. Reverse-image searches reveal that the man is demonstrating forced perspective: the rat isn&rsquo;t bigger, it&rsquo;s just closer to the camera. An accompanying <a href=\"https://www.wheninmanila.com/another-photo-reveals-actual-size-of-jumbo-rat/\">image</a>, which was omitted from the giant rat article, shows the same man and the same rat, but in the proper perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the giant swamp rat and the forced perspective images have been shared widely across fake news sites to &quot;prove&quot; that giant rats were caught in London, Hong Kong, and other urban areas across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This article alleges that four men have died after being eaten by giant-sized rats. However, the story is completely fictional. There are no mutant, man-eating rats in New York, and the pictures have been stolen from various other giant rat hoaxes over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-16T10:43:09.748184", "ruling_date": "2018-07-16T16:00:27", "ruling_headline": "Good news: No man-eating rats in NYC", "ruling_headline_slug": "good-news-no-man-eating-rats-nyc", "ruling_link_text": "Reports of 40-lb rats a hoax", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>National Geographic,&nbsp;</em>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/n/nutria/\">About the nutria</a>,&quot; November 11, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Guardian,&nbsp;</em>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/31/louisiana-swamp-rat-hunters-rodents-of-unusual-size\">Louisiana&#39;s quest to hunt the swamp rat,</a>&quot; October 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pusan National University, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268806352_Distribution_spread_and_habitat_preferences_of_nutria_Myocastor_coypus_invading_the_lower_Nakdong_River_South_Korea\">Distribution, spread and habitat preferences of nutria (Myocastor coypus) invading the lower Nakdong River, South Korea</a>,&quot; October 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When in Manila, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.wheninmanila.com/another-photo-reveals-actual-size-of-jumbo-rat/\">Another Photo Reveals &#39;Actual&#39; Size of &#39;Jumbo&#39; Rat</a>,&quot; May 26, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Giant rats&nbsp;plague New York City as 4 homeless men found eaten alive&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-07-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 210, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/210/", "subject": "Animals", "subject_slug": "animals", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/6/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Good news: No man-eating rats in NYC"}
