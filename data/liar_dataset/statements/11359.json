We changed the welfare system, which had been in place for about 40 years. We balanced the budget, of which I was chief architect. And we cut taxes. The economy was growing and we were doing great. And when I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader asked us about the $5 trillion number, and we didn&rsquo;t recall the surplus ever having been that high. So we looked back at the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kasich, now the second-term governor of Ohio, last served in the House in 2000, a year when Bill Clinton was ending his tenure in the White House and the Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That year, the federal government registered a $236 billion surplus. In raw dollars, that&rsquo;s the biggest one-year surplus in American history, but it&rsquo;s not anywhere near the $5-trillion number that Kasich mentioned. So what&rsquo;s going on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kasich campaign said it came from a 10-year figure for the size of the future surplus as determined by the Clinton administration in 2000. The administration <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/us/10-year-estimate-of-budget-surplus-surges-once-more.html\">projected</a> a cumulative $5 trillion surplus over 10 years, 2001 through 2010. (We should note the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/106th-congress-1999-2000/reports/long-term%20budget%20outlook.pdf\">projected</a> a lower surplus over the same time period of $4.6 trillion.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this never actually panned out, for a variety of reasons, including the technology bust, the post-9/11 attack recession and the Bush tax cuts, which decreased tax revenues collected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bigger problem with Kasich&rsquo;s claim is the shorthand terminology used to describe that number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Kasich said, &quot;When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus,&quot; the government never actually had a $5 trillion surplus in hand -- it had a projected $5 trillion surplus (and it was over 10 years, not one). That projection was also subject to numerous assumptions about future growth in spending and revenues -- assumptions that, as it turned out, didn&rsquo;t hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kasich&rsquo;s campaign acknowledged that his phrasing was somewhat elliptical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a bit of budget jargon to shorthand it to a &lsquo;$5 trillion surplus&rsquo; and leave off the &lsquo;projected,&rsquo; but it reflects the way these types of projections are used in policy and budget planning,&quot; said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Kasich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kasich &quot;typically notes that the $5 trillion was a projected surplus, but failed to do so in this instance,&quot; added Rob Nichols, another Kasich spokesman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kasich said, &quot;When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus.&quot; His rationale for the $5 trillion figure is reasonably sound, but he was inaccurate in how he referred to it. It was a 10-year cumulative projection for future surpluses, rather than a one-year actual surplus, and the savings turned out to be ephemeral due to unforeseen events. We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-28T13:22:55.751591", "ruling_date": "2015-09-29T15:56:27", "ruling_headline": "John Kasich says when he left the U.S. House, 'we had a $5 trillion surplus'", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-kasich-says-when-he-left-us-house-we-had-5-tr", "ruling_link_text": "That was the projected, 10-year figure that didn't come to pass", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>John Kasich, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4761601?5\">interview</a> on CBS&rsquo; <em>Face the Nation</em>, Sept. 27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/hist01z1.xls\">Table 1.1&mdash;Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789&ndash;2020</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/106th-congress-1999-2000/reports/long-term%20budget%20outlook.pdf\">Long Term Budget Outlook</a>,&quot; October 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/us/10-year-estimate-of-budget-surplus-surges-once-more.html\">10-Year Estimate of Budget Surplus Surges Once More</a>,&quot; Dec. 29, 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Sept. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interviews with Chris Schrimpf and Rob Nichols, spokesmen for John Kasich, Sept. 28, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "Governor of Ohio as of Jan. 10, 2011", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 533, "last_name": "Kasich", "mostly_true_count": 18, "name_slug": "john-kasich", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/John_Kasich_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/533/", "total_count": 67, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://ohio.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\"", "statement_date": "2015-09-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
