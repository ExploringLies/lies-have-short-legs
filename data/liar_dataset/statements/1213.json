Now all is forgiven.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n \"That's why you like Obama so much now?\" Moore asked.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I don't like Obama so much,\" Colbert said. \"On this, I do. And your film is helping me like Obama, because you're a critic of his. You think he's in the pocket of guys like Goldman Sachs.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I point out in the film that Goldman Sachs is his No. 1 private contributor,\" Moore answered. \"But I voted for the guy. I'm still hopeful that he's going to do the right thing and side with us, and not Wall Street. But the jury's out on that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We'll let you draw your own conclusions on their debate. We wanted to check Moore's statement about Obama's contributors and the financial services firm Goldman Sachs.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama made a big deal during the election that he didn't accept money from federal political action committees or lobbyists.\n</p>\n<p>\n But laws require individuals  to disclose their occupation and their employer when they donate to federal political candidates. We checked with the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data. Their numbers include contributions from employees and their immediate families.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their analysis of the 2008 presidential campaign found that University of California employees were Obama's top donor, giving a collective $1.6 million. That system is run by the state of California, and hence is a public employer.\n</p>\n<p>\n No. 2 was Goldman Sachs. Goldman employees gave Obama $994,795.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama's next biggest donors were the employees of Harvard University, Microsoft, Google, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase,&nbsp; Time Warner, the law firm Sidley Austin, and Stanford University.
