And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n We wondered if that was true and checked the latest\n <a href=\"http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/oefmonth.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Pentagon statistics\n </a>\n . Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary &mdash; it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that).\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching \"ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions.\"\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n \"I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan,\" Mullen said.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. \"We don't have a single adversary,\" he said. \"We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan.
