In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AH95oN-c_E\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"a YouTube video\">a YouTube video</a> available through <a href=\"http://www.ginaraimondo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"her website\">her  website</a>, she talks about wanting to come back to the state to start a  business.<br /><br />\"I wanted to create a company, create a business, in  Rhode Island. I could have chosen to put it elsewhere, but I wanted it  in Providence. So I came home and created it. It's called <a href=\"http://www.pointjudithcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Point Judith  Capital\">Point Judith Capital</a>, and it's the only venture capital  firm in Rhode Island. I'm very proud of what we've built.\"<br /><br />Venture  capitalists are people who raise money from <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">entities such as</span></span> private investors and public pension funds, and then invest it in  start-up companies, hoping for a big return if those companies take off.  It's a risky proposition, which is why there are not a lot of them  around.<br /><br />But we thought Rhode Island <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">had</span></span><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">&nbsp;</span></span>others  besides Point Judith.<br /><br />So we called Richard G. Horan, senior  managing director of the <a href=\"http://www.slaterfund.com/cms/index_new.asp\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Slater Technology Fund\">Slater Technology Fund</a>, which also  gives money to start-up companies. It turns out that there are other  groups in Rhode Island that serve a similar function, but they are not truly venture capital firms in the strict sense, which supports Raimondo's claim.<br /><br />\"There are others engaged in  venture investment, but they have a different orientation,\" said Horan.<br /><br />Slater,  for example, is publicly funded.&nbsp;<span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">It was created</span></span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"> by the state in 1997 to  stimulate the creation of new companies that focus on technology and is  financed annually by the General Assembl</span></span>y.<br /><br /></span>The  Slater Fund typically invests up to a million dollars in<strong>&nbsp;</strong> \"seed\"  money at the earliest stage of <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\"><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">a company's </span></span></span></span><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">d</span></span><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">e</span></span>velopment,  with the expectation that a traditional venture capital firm, such as  Raimondo's, will make a play to be involved in the company and provide  the next round of funding.<br /><br />Another class, known as angel  investors, also provides start<span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">-</span></span>up money for promising businesses.  They are represented in the state by the <a href=\"http://cherrystoneangelgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cherrystone Angel  Group\">Cherrystone Angel Group</a>. \"They tend to be individual  investors acting like investment clubs\" and think of themselves as being  in a separate class from venture capital firms, said Horan.<br /><br />Peter  Dorsey, executive director of Cherrystone, agreed, explaining that his  group, with 50 members, differs from a venture capital firm because it  is not a committed fund, not <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\"><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">professionally </span></span></span></span>managed and doesn't  have a paid staff.<br /><br />Finally, people often think of private equity  firms, such as Providence Equity Partners, as being involved in venture  capital, but they invest only in mature companies, he said. <a href=\"http://www.provequity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Providence Equity\">Providence  Equity</a>, for example, specializes in enterprises that deal with  media, communications and information.<br /><br />So both Dorsey and Horan  agree with Raimondo, who <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/RAIMONDO_TREASURER_01-21-10_66H6A07_v94.421a38b.html\" target=\"_blank\">told The Providence Journal</a> on Jan. 20 that she would quit Point Judith Capital if  she is elected.<br /><br />Point Judith is \"the one capital venture fund  based here in Rhode Island,\" Horan said, adding that, \"We need more. The  Rhode Island entrepreneurial community would benefit greatly if other  firms like Point Judith were established and operating here.\"<br /><br />So  we rate Raimondo's claim as True.</span></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-07T15:21:32.837312", "ruling_date": "2010-07-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Raimondo says hers is the only venture capital company in Rhode Island", "ruling_headline_slug": "raimondo-says-hers-only-venture-capital-company-rh", "ruling_link_text": "We venture that she's right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><a href=\"http://www.ginaraimondo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gina Raimondo for General Treasurer website\">Gina Raimondo for  General Treasurer website</a>, accessed July 1, 2010 <br /><br />YouTube.com  video, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AH95oN-c_E\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gina Raimondo for RI General Treasurer\">Gina Raimondo for RI  General Treasurer</a>, accessed July 1, 2010&nbsp; <br /><br />Interview, Richard  Horan, senior managing director, Slater Technology Fund, July 2, 2010<br /><br />Interview,  Peter Dorsey, executive director, Cherrystone Angel Group, July 6, 2010<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.slaterfund.com/cms/index_new.asp\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Slater Technology Fund website\">Slater Technology Fund website</a>,  accessed July 2, 2010 <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.pointjudithcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Point Judith  Capital website\">Point Judith Capital website</a>, accessed July 6, 2010  <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.provequity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Providence Equity Partners website\">Providence Equity Partners  website</a>, accessed July 6, 2010 <br /><br /><a href=\"http://cherrystoneangelgroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cherrystone  Angel Group website\">Cherrystone Angel Group website</a>, accessed July  6, 2010<br /><br />The Providence Journal, <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/RAIMONDO_TREASURER_01-21-10_66H6A07_v94.421a38b.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"Investment firm founder to run for state treasurer,\"</a> Jan. 21, 2010 <br /></span></p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "venture capital company founder", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Gina", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Rhode Island", "id": 501, "last_name": "Raimondo", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "gina-raimondo", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/raimondo.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Rhode Island", "edition": "Rhode Island", "edition_slug": "rhode-island", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 6, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Rhode Island Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/6/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/501/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.ginaraimondo.com/"}, "statement": "<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">The company I created, Point Judith Capital, \"is the only  venture capital firm in Rhode Island.\"</span></p>", "statement_context": "a video on her web page", "statement_date": "2010-07-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
