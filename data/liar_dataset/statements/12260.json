Jim Kenney was not one of them. He didn&rsquo;t use DROP and was outspoken against it as a councilman, calling for the program<a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/politics/90211-a-drop-foe-as-city-councilman-mayor-kenney-no-longer-wants-to-eliminate-pension-perk\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(38, 138, 140); line-height: inherit; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;to be eliminated</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it appears Kenney is cool with DROP &mdash; for the right employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>Inquirer</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160414_City_employees_take_DROP_money_and_return.html\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(38, 138, 140); line-height: inherit; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">revealed&nbsp;</a>last week Kenney&rsquo;s chief tech officer, Charles Brennan, took a DROP payment of $337,695 in 2006 when he retired from the police department. He now makes $165,000 a year in his current position. Mitchell J. Yanak retired from the police department in 2003, took a $99,537 DROP payment and now makes $142,800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim Kenney&rsquo;s director of communications, Lauren Hitt, told the newspaper &quot;It was decided that their decision to take DROP was not a disqualification because they both retired from the city many years ago and clearly did not intend to abuse DROP. While Mayor Kenney personally doesn&rsquo;t support DROP, he can&rsquo;t fault highly qualified city employees for appropriately utilizing a benefit that&rsquo;s available to them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement stands in stark contrast with what Hitt said in January while expressing Kenney&rsquo;s thoughts about City Commissioner Anthony Clark. Clark, who&rsquo;s been accused of rarely going to work and didn&rsquo;t vote in several elections despite being in charge of them, filed for DROP. He&rsquo;ll be able to receive $495,000 when his current four-year term ends. The&nbsp;<em>Inquirer</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2016-01-09/news/69617999_1_drop-payout-city-pension-board-city-commissioner-anthony-clark\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(38, 138, 140); line-height: inherit; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">wrote&nbsp;</a>of the Kenney administration&rsquo;s reactions like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Word of his signing on for DROP drew a swift rebuke from the new mayor. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a slap in the face to all Philadelphians,&rsquo; Mayor Kenney said Thursday night through spokeswoman Lauren Hitt, &lsquo;especially all our city workers who show up and do their jobs well every day.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitt confirmed to&nbsp;<em>Billy Penn</em>&nbsp;the above quote was intended to be about Clark&rsquo;s decision to apply for DROP. But she doesn&rsquo;t see this as a change in stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brennan and Yanak retired from the PPD 10 and 13 years ago, respectively, where they did excellent work,&quot; Hitt said. &quot;Clark is regularly absent from work and despite being in charge of the City&rsquo;s elections, didn&rsquo;t even vote &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure you could find many Philadelphians who would classify him as a &quot;highly-qualified city employee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We followed up by asking whether Kenney is of the opinion it&rsquo;s OK for people to take DROP if they are good employees and don&rsquo;t work for the city for a while? She responded, &quot;What Clark did is a slap in the face because he added insult to injury. He doesn&rsquo;t show up to vote, he doesn&rsquo;t show up to work and now he&rsquo;s going to collect the DROP. If you don&rsquo;t show up to work, you shouldn&rsquo;t get a salary let alone a retirement package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a result, there&rsquo;s no contradiction with what I send this week regarding Brennan and Yanak. Clark isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;high-quality employee,&rsquo; he&rsquo;s an elected official with an abysmal attendance record, and he&rsquo;s not &lsquo;appropriately utilizing&rsquo; DROP.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kenney&rsquo;s position on DROP for Brennan and Yanak doesn&rsquo;t square with his past statements, either during his time on Council and or on the campaign trail.
