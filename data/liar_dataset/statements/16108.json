Peter Roskam of Wheaton and Democratic challenger Sean Casten tussled over a wide range of disagreements and accusations, but one about health care policy stood out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roskam, seeking a seventh term in his west suburban district, was asked by debate moderator Carol Marin of WTTW to reconcile repeated votes to repeal Obamacare with his claim that he strongly supports insurance safeguards for those with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, like many people have said, let&rsquo;s take the good things out of it and embrace those and shun the bad things. And that&rsquo;s exactly what we did,&quot; Roskam responded, referring to a Republican substitute for Obamacare that was narrowly defeated. &quot;Sean has falsely accused me of being against protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and that was fact-checked by the Washington Post who gave that four Pinocchios.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did fact checkers at the Washington Post indeed side with Roskam? And has Roskam always championed those pre-existing protections, as he claimed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is &quot;no.&quot; No such fact check exists. PolitiFact and Washington Post fact checkers have also determined that the Republican health plan Roskam backed would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longer answer involves a concerted effort by several congressional Republicans, as well as <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/05/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-about-democrats-pre/\">President Donald</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055077740792160256\">Trump,</a> to misleadingly recast the GOP as defenders of one of the most popular elements of the very health care law that they have attempted to dismantle for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Playing with Pinocchios</div>\r\n\r\n<p>First a word about Pinocchios.

At the same time, he pointed to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/19/hey-attack-ad-honchos-stop-stealing-our-pinocchios/?utm_term=.f3894f818da2\">recent Four</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/16/virginia-congressman-misrepresents-washington-post-fact-check-debate/?utm_term=.9beef6e4e177\">Pinocchio ratings</a> he had given to Rep. Jeff Denham, a Republican from California, and Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, for making essentially the same claim Roskam made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we first contacted Kessler, he has told followers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlennKesslerWP/status/1055444277763817472?s=09\">on Twitter</a> that at least three other Republican House members have joined Denham, Brat and Roskam in repeating the false assertion, among them Rep. Rodney Davis, who is locked in a tight re-election battle in the central Illinois 13th District.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kessler called them all out on Twitter following our inquiry. &quot;Lawmakers, if you voted for AHCA, defend your decision, but do not try to hide behind our Pinocchios,&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlennKesslerWP/status/1055224432636149763\">he wrote </a>after quoting Roskam specifically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>[From the Washington Post: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/29/these-republicans-are-misleading-voters-about-our-obamacare-fact-checks/?utm_term=.66930fe357f2\">These Republicans are misleading voters about our Obamacare fact checks</a>]</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support of Roskam&rsquo;s claim, the Republican&rsquo;s campaign pointed us to a Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/05/10/kamala-harriss-claim-that-129-million-people-with-preexisting-conditions-could-be-denied-coverage/?utm_term=.ccfd171700b9\">fact check</a> of a statement from Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California that took her to task for significantly inflating the number of people with pre-existing conditions that would be put at risk by the GOP plan, called the American Health Care Act. It passed the House but died in the Senate last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the same fact check Denham erroneously cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowhere does the piece about Harris credit the Republican substitute health plan backed by Roskam and the others with protecting pre-existing conditions.

But it would allow for insurers to charge some with pre-existing conditions significantly more for coverage, potentially making policies too expensive to afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Roskam said his Democratic opponent had falsely accused him &quot;of being against protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and that was fact-checked by the Washington Post who gave that four Pinocchios.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No such fact check exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roskam&rsquo;s campaign did point us to a fact check of a claim made by a Senate Democrat that greatly overestimated the number of Americans with pre-existing conditions who might not be able to access coverage if Obamacare were replaced by GOP substitute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that fact check had nothing to do with Roskam or his stance. Roskam voted for the substitute, which would have weakened the pre-existing condition protections of Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t hand out Pinocchios, but we have a similar measure for whoppers like Roskam&rsquo;s.
