Child Care Aware, a trade and advocacy group, found that it cost on average <a href=\"http://usa.childcareaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-Fact-Sheets-Full-Report-02-27-17.pdf\">over $17,000 a year</a> for infant day care in Massachusetts. The question is, does paying for child care top all the other expenses that half of the households have to cover, such as housing and food?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government data suggests it does not. For most families, the No. 1 cost is housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest data on child care comes from a <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2013/demo/p70-135.pdf\">2011 survey</a> by the U.S. Census Bureau. It found that for all families with children under 15-years-old, child care costs 7 percent of their monthly income. The fraction was highest for families making less than $1,500 a month. They represented about 10 percent of the sample and paid nearly 40% of their income for child care. (However, the margin of error was quite large.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So then we looked at what Americans spend on their other needs. The <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> found that in 2015, the average married couple with children spent about 31 percent on housing, followed by about 18 percent on transportation. For single parents, housing ate up about 37 percent of their budget, and transportation, about 17 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health care was the only category that took up a lower fraction than child care (which this&nbsp;expenditure report did not highlight). Married couples with children spent about 6.8 percent and single parents about 5.2 percent on health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two bits of information that add a bit of support for Trump&rsquo;s assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New America Foundation, a center-left think tank in Washington, <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/care-report/explore-care-index/\">reported in 2016</a> that in a handful of states, including West Virginia, Mississippi, New York and Nevada, costs can rise above 30 percent of the state&rsquo;s median income. But the underlying calculation used an expected cost of child care, not actual spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2015 article in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/annabahney/2015/06/29/child-care-is-biggest-expense-for-a-growing-number-of-families/#3fa570eee8ad\">Forbes</a> reported, &quot;For many parents the cost (of child care) is greater than housing, transportation or utilities.&quot; However, the source behind that was a survey from the Child Care Aware organization. That group&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://usa.childcareaware.org/advocacy-public-policy/resources/reports-and-research/statefactsheets/\">latest report </a>is more restrained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said the price tag in every state &quot;rivals families&rsquo; annual expenditures on housing, transportation and the cost of tuition at a four-year, public university.&quot; It went on to say &quot;in 38 states, the cost of infant care exceeds 10 percent of the state&rsquo;s median income for a two-parent family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But neither statistic puts the cost of child care above all other expenses for half of all households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the White House and as of publication, were still waiting for numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that child care is the single largest expense faced by half of American families. We could find no data to support that. The number we did find suggests it isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A government survey in 2011 found that the average family spends about 7 percent of its monthly income on child care. For the poorest households, the number rises to nearly 40 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the government&rsquo;s consumer expenditure survey found households with children spend at least 30 percent of their money on housing and at least 17 percent on transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two data sets are not perfectly comparable, but they don&rsquo;t suggest that child care tops the list of expenses for half of all families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Child care is a staggering burden for lower income households. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-25T21:01:09.314086", "ruling_date": "2017-04-26T09:38:15", "ruling_headline": "Ivanka Trump wrongly says child care single largest expense for half of households", "ruling_headline_slug": "ivanka-trump-wrongly-says-child-care-costs-top-oth", "ruling_link_text": "UPDATED: Evidence suggests otherwise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Internet Archive, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/CSPAN2_20170426_000900_Ivanka_Trump_Speaks_at_Womens_Leadership_Forum_in_Berlin/start/4260.5/end/4275\">Ivanka Trump speaks at Women&#39;s Leadership Forum in Berlin</a>, April 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BuzzFeed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsjina/status/856843969614970880\">tweet</a>, April 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2017/04/25/ivanka-visits-germany-to-talk-economic-empowerment/\">Ivanka visits Germany to talk economic empowerment</a>, April 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/25/525533779/ivanka-trump-discusses-female-entrepreneurs-and-her-father-at-w20-summit-in-berl\">Ivanka Trump Talks Female Entrepreneurs And Her Father At W20 Summit In Berlin</a>, April 25, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Care.com, <a href=\"https://www.care.com/c/stories/2423/how-much-does-child-care-cost/\">How Much Does Child Care Cost?</a>, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2013/demo/p70-135.pdf\">Who&rsquo;s Minding the Kids?
