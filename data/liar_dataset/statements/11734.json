She said Obama and Clinton have left the United States &quot;woefully uprepared for cyberterrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina said cybersecurity is &quot;a critical piece of our strategy to defeat ISIS and restore American leadership in the world.&quot; She made a number of assertions in that column; here we&rsquo;ll look at one she made about the United States&rsquo; efforts to prevent cyber attacks from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When we held recent economic dialogues with China,&quot; Fiorina wrote, &quot;we agreed on over 100 different things\u200a&mdash; \u200aincluding wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China has been implicated in past data breaches, including perhaps the most far-reaching hacking incident so far, which accessed a large cache of sensitive personal data held by the federal Office of Personnel Management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign spokeswoman Anna Epstein told us that Fiorina was referring to a news release in which the White House <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/06/244205.htm\">summarized</a> 127 areas of agreement reached in June 2015 at the <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Pages/china.aspx\">Strategic &amp; Economic Dialogue</a>, a periodic summit between high-level representatives of the United States and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina has a point that none of the 127 items on that list explicitly addressed cybersecurity. However, her argument is weaker if one looks beyond that list of 127 items: Fiorina ignored a subsequent agreement between the United States and China that dealt directly with cybersecurity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s start with the summit. In their <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/06/244120.htm\">public addresses at the summit&rsquo;s opening</a>, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew each said that cybersecurity was an important issue for U.S.-China relations, and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang agreed in his speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cybersecurity discussion -- a thorny one -- apparently did not lead to an agreement by the end of the summit, though experts told PolitiFact it may have been covered within the 127-point list by point 4, which confirmed the existence of &quot;candid, constructive discussions between the two sides on strategic security issues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest problem with Fiorina&rsquo;s claim, though, is that it fails to account for significant developments later in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important of these is an agreement on cybersecurity between the United States and China announced in September. That came almost three months before Fiorina posted her column.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sept. 24 and 25, Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China for a state visit. During that visit, the two leaders announced an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states\">agreement</a> on cybersecurity. Here are some of the key elements the two countries agreed on:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Cooperation on investigating malicious cyber-activities coming from their territory;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; A pledge not to conduct or knowingly support cyber-theft of confidential business information to aid companies or industries;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Efforts to promote international consensus on norms for state behavior in cyberspace;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Creation of a &quot;high-level joint dialogue&quot; on cybercrime with regular meetings, as well as a &quot;hotline&quot; to prevent the escalation of issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This was important, because China accepted that states should not conduct cyber espionage against commercial entities to create competitive advantage,&quot; said Adam Segal, senior fellow for China studies and director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there have been notable developments since then, Segal <a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2016/01/04/top-5-us-china-cyber-agreement/\">has written</a>: &quot;There was positive follow up in the<a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/news/2015/12/02/first-us-china-high-level-joint-dialogue-cybercrime-and-related-issues-summary\"> first round of cyber talks</a> between the Department of Homeland Security and Chinese Ministry of Public Security in December 2015&quot; when the two sides &quot;agreed on guidelines for requesting assistance on cybercrime or other malicious cyber activities, as well as to conduct &lsquo;tabletop exercises&rsquo; in spring 2016 and to define procedures for use of the hotline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, since Xi&rsquo;s visit, the White House has worked to advance cybersecurity policies with other countries. A similar agreement between the<a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257602-uk-china-mirror-us-anti-hacking-pact\"> United Kingdom and China</a> has been struck, and there are indications that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/1877288/china-and-germany-aim-reach-commercial-cyberspying-deal\">Germany</a> would sign a &quot;no cyber theft&quot; deal with Beijing in 2016, Segal wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, during the G-20 summit in November 2015, the White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/16/fact-sheet-2015-g-20-summit-antalya-turkey\">announced</a> that the leaders in attendance reached a notable consensus that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace, including pledges not to &quot;conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that experts acknowledge significant difficulties in enforcing cybersecurity agreements. &quot;Just three weeks after the agreement, cybersecurity companies reported new attacks on<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-cybersecurity-idUSKCN0SD0AT20151020\"> pharmaceutical companies</a>,&quot; Segal wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina said, &quot;When we held recent economic dialogues with China, we agreed on over 100 different things\u200a&mdash;\u200aincluding wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One document listing agreements struck during a June 2015 U.S.-China summit supports Fiorina&rsquo;s point, but citing that one document is a case of extreme cherry-picking. Three months later -- and three months before Fiorina published her article -- the United States and China struck a significant cybersecurity agreement, and since then, the countries have taken steps to implement the agreement and forge cybersecurity agreements with other nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-07T11:48:26.806239", "ruling_date": "2016-01-07T13:54:53", "ruling_headline": "Carly Fiorina says U.S. didn't address cybersecurity in economic dialogues with China", "ruling_headline_slug": "carly-fiorina-says-us-didnt-address-cybersecurity-", "ruling_link_text": "Major agreement came three months later", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Carly Fiorina, &quot;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@CarlyFiorina/cybersecurity-234e2aa2a007#.bwucg9kaj\">Cybersecurity</a>&quot; (on Medium), Dec 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/06/244205.htm\">U.S.-China Strategic &amp; Economic Dialogue Outcomes of the Strategic Track</a>,&quot; June 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/06/244120.htm\">The U.S.-China Strategic &amp; Economic Dialogue / Consultation on People-to-People Exchange</a>,&quot; June 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Department of Homeland Security, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/news/2015/12/02/first-us-china-high-level-joint-dialogue-cybercrime-and-related-issues-summary\">First U.S.-China High-Level Joint Dialogue On Cybercrime And Related Issues Summary Of Outcomes</a>,&quot; Dec. 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states\">Fact sheet: President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s State Visit to the United States</a>,&quot; Sept. 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/16/fact-sheet-2015-g-20-summit-antalya-turkey\">Fact Sheet: The 2015 G-20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey</a>,&quot; Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justice Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor\">U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage</a>,&quot; May 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam Segal, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/author/asegal/\">The Top Five Cyber Policy Developments of 2015: United States-China Cyber Agreement</a>,&quot; Jan. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html\">&quot;Chinese breach data of 4 million federal workers</a>,&quot; June 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257602-uk-china-mirror-us-anti-hacking-pact\">UK, China mirror US anti-hacking pact</a>,&quot; Oct. 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South China Morning Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/1877288/china-and-germany-aim-reach-commercial-cyberspying-deal\">Handshake to end the hacking: China and Germany pledge for peace in cyberspace by 2016</a>,&quot; Nov. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-cybersecurity-idUSKCN0SD0AT20151020\">China tried to hack U.S. firms even after cyber pact: CrowdStrike</a>,&quot; Oct. 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/world/asia/us-and-china-seek-arms-deal-for-cyberspace.html?_r=1\">U.S. and China Seek Arms Deal for Cyberspace</a>,&quot; Sept. 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Malcolm Lee, senior fellow at the John L.
