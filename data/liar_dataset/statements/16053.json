But the bigger problem was that Evers blamed the cost difference on Walker&rsquo;s refusal to accept additional federal aid to do an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), when many factors were at work, as experts told us then:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Other factors that determine premiums include reinsurance, risk pool differences and competition between insurers and providers, said a health care expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. </strong>&quot;It is just challenging to draw hard and fast conclusions when you&rsquo;re just comparing one state to another, because states can have very different policy and market dynamics,&quot; a Georgetown University expert said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers has similar problems with the statement we&rsquo;re checking now.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">New Evers claim</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As he did in his earlier claim, Evers in his new claim relies on data from a gold-standard source on health care, the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation.

And many people, including the elderly, are covered by programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broader measures can paint a different picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Walker&rsquo;s campaign also cites Kaiser research, but on a measure involving more people &mdash; the average annual family premium per enrolled employee for employer-based health insurance. For 2017, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/family-coverage/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22wisconsin%22:%7B%7D,%22minnesota%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">the employee contribution</a> in Minnesota was $4,998, slightly higher than the $4,842 in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our rating</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers says: &quot;Wisconsin pays 50% more than Minnesota for the same health care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one measure &mdash; how much 40-year-old individuals pay for health insurance they buy on their own &mdash; the annual average premium is nearly 50 percent higher in Wisconsin than in Minnesota.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Evers&rsquo; statement is broad, and that measure is narrow, given that the vast majority of people get their health insurance through an employer or from the government. By one measure of employer-provided health insurance, the average annual premium paid by employees was actually 3 percent higher in Minnesota than in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Evers suggests Walker has failed to address health care costs, when many factors are involved, especially in an apples-to-oranges comparison of two states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers&rsquo; statement has only an element of truth and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression &mdash; our definition of Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-22T15:58:26.498542", "ruling_date": "2018-10-22T15:58:25", "ruling_headline": "In attack on Scott Walker, Tony Evers misleads in claiming health care costs 50% more in Wisconsin", "ruling_headline_slug": "attack-scott-walker-tony-evers-misleads-claiming-h", "ruling_link_text": "Cites one narrow measure", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxG67romNho&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Tony Evers TV ad</a>, Oct. 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Tony Evers campaign spokesman Sam Lau, Oct. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Scott Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg, Oct. 19, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/07/tony-evers/evers-base-attacking-walker-health-care/\">&quot;Tony Evers wrong to blame Scott Walker&#39;s rejection of Medicaid money for higher health costs,&quot;</a> Sept. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=2018&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">&quot;Marketplace Average Benchmark Premiums, 2014-2018,&quot;</a> accessed Oct. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/trends-in-employer-sponsored-insurance-offer-and-coverage-rates-1999-2014/\">&quot;Trends in Employer-Sponsored Insurance Offer and Coverage Rates, 1999-2014,&quot;</a> March 21, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Tony", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 2350, "last_name": "Evers", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "tony-evers", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 14, "party": "State official", "party_slug": "state-official", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/14/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Tony_Evers__PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2350/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Wisconsin pays 50% more than Minnesota for the same health care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV ad", "statement_date": "2018-10-09", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
