Here, we&#39;re looking at whether the district has&nbsp;graduation rates &quot;substantially higher than the state average&quot; and dropout rates &quot;below the state average.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe press release puts it this way: The district &quot;increased graduation rate of 88.5 percent (Florida calculation) and 85.5 percent (National Governors Association calculation), which are substantially higher than the state average.&quot; It also &quot;secured [a] dropout rate of 1.0 percent, which has plummeted below the state average.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tState reports show that Fiorentino rightly states the district&rsquo;s graduation rates, and that they are higher than state averages, which were 81.2 percent and 80.1 percent, according to the two different calculations. Pasco&rsquo;s rates are also up significantly from 2006-07 on both the state (73.7 percent) and governors association (67.8 percent) measures.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPasco also was among a small handful of districts that did not have significant gaps in the rates among its various demographic groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFiorentino accurately touts the district&rsquo;s improved dropout rate. State reports show the district dropout rate was 1.0 percent for 2010-11, down from 3.5 percent in 2006-07. The overall state rates were 3.3 percent in 2006-07 and 1.9 percent in 2010-11, so Pasco did show better improvement than the state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFiorentino is on solid ground in these two numeric claims about the district&rsquo;s academic performance. We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-02T15:57:27.059250", "ruling_date": "2012-03-04T12:43:13", "ruling_headline": "Pasco County schools have graduation rates above the state average and dropout rates below the state average, says Heather Fiorentino", "ruling_headline_slug": "pasco-county-schools-have-graduation-rates-above-s", "ruling_link_text": "Beating the state average", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Tampa Bay Times</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/k12/statements-by-pasco-superintendent-fiorentino-touting-her-record-are/1218289\">Statements by Pasco superintendent Fiorentino touting her record are mostly on the mark</a>, March 4, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Committee to re-elect Superintendent Heather Fiorentino, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/322241-fiorentino-press-releasepdf.html\">press release</a>, Jan. 6, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.fldoe.org/eias/eiaspubs/pubstudent.asp\">graduation and drop-out rates</a>, accessed March 2, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "superintendent of Pasco County's public schools", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Heather", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 1713, "last_name": "Fiorentino", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "heather-fiorentino", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Fiorentino.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1713/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.heatherfiorentino.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tPasco County schools have graduation rates &quot;substantially higher than the state average&quot; and dropout rates &quot;below the state average.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press release", "statement_date": "2012-01-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
