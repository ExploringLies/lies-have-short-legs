For crying out loud, this is not our grandfather&rsquo;s America, and we ought not act like it is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fifteenth wealthiest, out of 196 countries, sounds impressive and worth checking out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buying power of African-Americans</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder referred us to an annual report by Target Market News called <a href=\"http://targetmarketnews.com/storyid04251301.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;The Buying Power of Black America,</u></a>&quot; which publishes the only estimate we could find of the total earned income of African-Americans. In 2011, the report he provided us, Target Market News put the income spent by African-Americans at $836 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder got his talking point by comparing that figure to the <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/countries-with-the-highest-gdp/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>World Bank&rsquo;s list</u></a> of each country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp\">which is the&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp\">monetary value</a> of all the finished goods and services produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, &quot;black America&#39;s&quot; $836 billion would have put it in 16th, above Indonesia and below South Korea. (The Target Market News report is behind a paywall, so we can&rsquo;t see precisely how they reached their figure. We asked if&nbsp;Target Market News would provide us a copy, but we didn&#39;t hear back.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Target Market News hasn&rsquo;t published another estimate on African-American&rsquo;s earned income since 2011, but a <a href=\"http://www.terry.uga.edu/news/releases/minority-buying-power-grows-in-2013-according-to-selig-center-report\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2013 report</u></a> by the Selig Center for Economic Growth pegs their contribution to the market at $1 trillion. That would also rank <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>16th</u></a> -- above Indonesia and below Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case closed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not really. Experts told us that there are two major problems with Elder&rsquo;s methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Earned income vs. GDP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, earned income and GDP aren&#39;t quite the same thing. Comparing them isn&rsquo;t fair, said NYU economics professor Gian Luca Clementi, &quot;because GDP is a concept that applies to a jurisdiction, not a group of people living in a jurisdiction.&quot; GDP is &quot;a measure of the total income produced in a country,&quot; Clementi said, and factors like government expenditure and private investment mean that buying power and GDP aren&#39;t comparable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, Clementi said, &quot;a country&#39;s total GDP only gives a measure of the total income produced in the country. Anyone having the ambition of using GDP as a measure of average economic well-being, should start dividing by the number of residents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clementi used China as an example to better explain. While China has the world&#39;s second-highest GDP, &quot;its inhabitants are still a lot poorer than any Western country&rsquo;s residents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took Clementi&#39;s suggestion and divided the most recent estimate of black earned income, $1 trillion, by the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2014/sep/02/fact-checking-claims-about-islamic-state/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Census Bureau estimate</u></a> of 44.5 million African-Americans. That would create a per capita buying power of around $23,000 a year, which would translate to around 34th around the world on the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2013&amp;ey=2013&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=512%2C668%2C914%2C672%2C612%2C946%2C614%2C137%2C311%2C962%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C193%2C548%2C122%2C556%2C912%2C678%2C313%2C181%2C419%2C867%2C513%2C682%2C316%2C684%2C913%2C273%2C124%2C868%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C142%2C156%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C453%2C960%2C968%2C423%2C922%2C935%2C714%2C128%2C862%2C611%2C135%2C321%2C716%2C243%2C456%2C248%2C722%2C469%2C942%2C253%2C718%2C642%2C724%2C643%2C576%2C939%2C936%2C644%2C961%2C819%2C813%2C172%2C199%2C132%2C733%2C646%2C184%2C648%2C524%2C915%2C361%2C134%2C362%2C652%2C364%2C174%2C732%2C328%2C366%2C258%2C734%2C656%2C144%2C654%2C146%2C336%2C463%2C263%2C528%2C268%2C923%2C532%2C738%2C944%2C578%2C176%2C537%2C534%2C742%2C536%2C866%2C429%2C369%2C433%2C744%2C178%2C186%2C436%2C925%2C136%2C869%2C343%2C746%2C158%2C926%2C439%2C466%2C916%2C112%2C664%2C111%2C826%2C298%2C542%2C927%2C967%2C846%2C443%2C299%2C917%2C582%2C544%2C474%2C941%2C754%2C446%2C698%2C666&amp;s=NGDPDPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&amp;pr.x=41&amp;pr.y=13\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>list of countries by GDP per capita</u></a> (between the Bahamas and Malta).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But $23,000 doesn&rsquo;t go as far in the United States as, say, in Lithuania. Economists multiply GDP per capita by a conversion factor called purchasing power parity to account for the different values of goods and services in different countries. If you apply these factors, the African-American population&rsquo;s $23,000 a year <a href=\"https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/worlds-richest-and-poorest-countries\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>ranks 44th</u></a> (between Portugal and Lithuania).</p>\r\n\r\n<div>The United States as a whole, for comparison, ranks seventh.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguing that racism is &quot;not a major problem,&quot; Elder said that &quot;if black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elder took an estimate of African-Americans&#39;&nbsp;total earned income ($836 billion in 2011) and looked at how it compared to national GDPs (it was actually 16th). But comparing earned income for a group of people to national GDPs isn&rsquo;t a sound methodology, experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comparison falls more off the rails when you look at things on a per capita basis. In that scenario, black America&rsquo;s buying power would rank around 44th when compared to countries&rsquo; per capita GDPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Correction: Elder said racism was not a &quot;major&quot; problem.
