That&rsquo;s of interest because Republicans  seek to widen their 77-73 House edge on Democrats in November's general  election while Democrats hope they can win the three additional seats  they need to gain the majority.<br /><br /> In a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/texasgop\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter post\">Twitter  post</a> on the morning of March 10, the GOP states: &quot;War for the soul  of the TxDems: 57% of Dem incumbents for Tx House LOST their primary.&quot;<br /><br /> Hold the horses: Did nearly six in 10 House Democrats lose re-election  all of a hurry &mdash; and if so, where was <em>that</em> story told?<br /><br /> GOP  spokesman Bryan Preston told us the 57 percent figure, which the party  repeated in a second Twitter post that day, reflects the fact that four  of seven House Democrats who had opponents lost their primaries. The  losers were Reps. Terri Hodge of Dallas, Al Edwards of Houston, Dora  Olivo of Rosenberg and Tara Rios Ybarra of South Padre Island.<br /><br /> But that's an incomplete way of analyzing the results. It overlooks 64 Democratic incumbents who didn't have opponents and were renominated and Rep. Norma Chavez of El Paso, who faces an April runoff.  The 64 unopposed incumbents are set to stand for re-election in November. One Democratic incumbent, David Farabee of Wichita Falls,  didn&rsquo;t seek re-election.<br /><br />Punch line: Some 67 of 72 Democratic  incumbents on the March 2 ballot qualified for the November ballot. Take  them into account and the share of incumbents who lost their primary  drops to nearly 7 percent.<br /><br />Preston reminded us, correctly, that in  order to lose a primary \"one must face a primary challenge, and of those  state House Democrat incumbents who were challenged in the primary, 57  percent lost.\"&nbsp;<br /><br />If the party had included the word \"opposed\" in  front of \"incumbents,\" there'd be no confusion. It could have done  so within the 140-character limit set by Twitter.<br /><br />Preston said:  \"If I had it to do over again, I would certainly throw 'opposed' in  there.\" <br /><br />The GOP's item misrepresents the overall results for Democratic House  incumbents. We rate the party's statement as Barely True.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
