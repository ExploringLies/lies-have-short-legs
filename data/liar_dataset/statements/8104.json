During a &quot;Talking Points&quot; segment, the conservative white commentator took aim at the breakdown of the African-American family, drugs and the entertainment industry&rsquo;s promotion of &quot;gangsta culture.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then CNN anchor Don Lemon took O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s commentary a step further. Lemon, in a response that has since gone viral, launched <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2013/07/27/nr-lemon-no-talking-points.cnn\">his own rant</a> last weekend during an on-air &quot;No Talking Points&quot; segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemon, who is black, outlined five points for African-Americans to fix their problems, a kind of free self-help session. They included: pull up your pants, respect where you live and finish school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemon threw out a couple of statistics to cement his points. So we decided to check out his numbers referenced in his education argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You want to break the cycle of poverty?&quot; Lemon says in the rant. &quot;Stop telling kids they&#39;re acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That&#39;s a lot of money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of money, indeed. Enough money to warrant a check of the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CNN anchor&rsquo;s rant led immediately to a huge <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/views/start-man-mirror-don-lemon?wpisrc=root_lightbox\"><u>blowback</u></a> from people across the country, and much of it unfolded on social media. Atlanta political insider-turned MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor even referred to Lemon as a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/28/don-lemon-bill-oreilly-black-people_n_3666966.html?ir=Media\"><u>&quot;turncoat&quot;</u></a> in a series of fiery Twitter posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemon&rsquo;s opinions are his own and not up for checking. PolitiFact looks at statements of purported fact, not opinions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what of Lemon&rsquo;s educational attainment stats?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several sources that have examined Americans&rsquo; earnings by education level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm\"><u>found</u></a> that weekly median annual earnings in 2012 for a high school dropout were $471; $652 for a high school graduate; and $1,066 for a college graduate with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Multiplying those weekly figures by 52, and the annual earnings for a high school dropout were $24,492, compared with $33,904 for a high school graduate and $55,432 for a college graduate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BLS data, last modified in May, is for people age 25 and over, and earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/wages/?reader\"><u>study</u></a> by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal economics think tank, found that the average hourly wage in 2012 for people without a high school diploma was $11.75, compared with $15.78 for high school graduates and $28.28 for college graduates. In 2012, the BLS reported that Americans at private, nonfarm companies worked an average of <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm\"><u>34.5 hours</u></a> per week. Do the math on those numbers, and high school dropouts earned $21,080 for the year; high school graduates, $28,309; and college graduates, $50,734.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several university and economic studies have used 2010 census data of median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers age 25-64. The data, released in 2011, found that non-high school graduates made $25,705; high school graduates, $35,035; and college graduates with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, $55,864.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the course of a lifetime, a Georgetown University <a href=\"http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/collegepayoff-summary.pdf\"><u>study</u></a> found that high school graduates would make $1.3 million, while college graduates with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree would make $2.3 million. The report, and others, note that occupation, gender, race and ethnicity can influence outcomes. Those influences, along with a tough economy, have caused some researchers to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703822404575019082819966538.html\"><u>lower </u></a>the lifetime gap to between $280,000 and $450,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, does Lemon&rsquo;s claim pay off?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on what data is collected, how that data is collected and what data set you consider, Lemon&rsquo;s claim could be correct, or at least within a few thousand dollars for each educational level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But use other data, and his claim could be off by several thousand dollars. Also of note, several factors -- including gender, occupation, age and the economy -- can influence annual and lifetime earnings for workers at all education levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, his overall theme that higher educational attainment equals higher wages seems to be correct no matter which data set is considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated Lemon&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-01T17:13:16.137915", "ruling_date": "2013-08-02T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Educational levels generally make a difference in earnings", "ruling_headline_slug": "educational-levels-generally-make-difference-earni", "ruling_link_text": "More school usually means more pay", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, &quot;No Talking Points&quot; <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2013/07/27/nr-lemon-no-talking-points.cnn\"><u>segment</u></a>, Don Lemon, July 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Clear Politics <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/27/cnns_don_lemon_bill_oreillys_criticism_of_black_community_doesnt_go_far_enough.html\"><u>video and transcript,</u></a> &quot;CNN&#39;s Don Lemon: Bill O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Criticism Of Black Community &lsquo;Doesn&#39;t Go Far Enough,&rsquo;&quot; July 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox News, &quot;Talking Points: <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/2560422134001/president-obama-and-the-race-problem-/\"><u>President Obama and the race problem</u></a>,&quot; Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, July 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/don-lemon/cnns-don-lemon-says-more-72-percent-african-americ/\"><u>PolitiFact</u></a>, &quot;CNN&rsquo;s Don Lemon says more than 72 percent of African-American births are out of wedlock,&quot; Louis Jacobson, July 29, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic Policy Institute, <a href=\"http://stateofworkingamerica.org/subjects/wages/?reader\"><u>The State of Working America</u></a>,12th edition, Table 4-14, published November 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Earnings and unemployment rates by <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm\"><u>educational attainment</u></a>, modified May 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huffington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/28/don-lemon-bill-oreilly-black-people_n_3666966.html?ir=Media\"><u>Don Lemon: Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s &lsquo;got a point&rsquo; about black people,</u></a>&quot; Katherine Fung, July 28, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Root, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/views/start-man-mirror-don-lemon?wpisrc=root_lightbox\"><u>Start with the man in the mirror, Don Lemon</u></a>,&quot; Helena Andrews, July 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, &quot;<a href=\"http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/collegepayoff-summary.pdf\"><u>The College Payoff</u></a>: Education, Occupation and Lifetime Earnings,&quot; released Aug. 5, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703822404575019082819966538.html\"><u>What&rsquo;s a degree really worth</u></a>,&quot; Mary Pilon, Feb. 2, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "CNN anchor", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Don", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2381, "last_name": "Lemon", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "don-lemon", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 64, "party": "Journalist", "party_slug": "journalist", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/64/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/lemon.don.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2381/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "https://twitter.com/DonLemonCNN"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a commentary on CNN", "statement_date": "2013-07-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
