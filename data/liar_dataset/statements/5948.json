Daniel Webster. At this time, Grayson is the only Democrat in the race.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>From this moment on</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama signed the Affordable Care Act into law May 23, 2010. It&rsquo;s been a long and winding legal path ever since.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt issue, for most plaintiffs, is the individual mandate, which requires all citizens to buy health insurance and takes effect in 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ACA Litigation Blog, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/how-obamacare-got-the-supreme-court/2012/03/30/gIQAN3kzlS_blog.html\">launched by</a> Santa Clara University law professor Brad Joondeph, keeps a <a href=\"http://acalitigationblog.blogspot.com/\">spreadsheet </a>of all lawsuits against the reforms on its website. By its count, 31 parties have filed lawsuits against the law, 12 of which have been dropped. Eight have reached the Supreme Court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the same day Obama signed the law, then-Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum <a href=\"http://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/2426DBDB65C843D7852576EF005DB3A4\">filed a lawsuit </a>on behalf of 13 states challenging the law. (Ultimately, 26 governors and attorneys general joined the suit.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo months later, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli sued the government over the law&rsquo;s implementation. At the end of 2010, a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/policy/14health.html?gwh=7713D83038FA42F9E4581E8E6AA65A52\">Virginia district judge appointed by Ronald Reagan ruled</a> the individual mandate unconstitutional.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida re-entered the picture on <a href=\"about:blank\">Jan. 31, 2011</a>. Pensacola-based U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson went further than the Virginia judge, declaring in<em> Florida v. HHS</em>&nbsp;that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and &quot;inextricably bound&quot; to the rest of the law -- meaning the whole thing needed to be tossed out because of that faulty provision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker,&quot; Vinson wrote in <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/47905955/Vinson-opinion\">his opinion</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVinson&rsquo;s decision on the individual mandate was upheld by a three-person panel at the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/12/us-usa-healthcare-idUSTRE77B4J320110812\">in Atlanta on Aug. 12, 2011</a>, though they reversed his recommendation to throw out the law. The case then moved up to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen a district judge in Pennsylvania ruled <a href=\"http://healthcarelawsuits.org/detail.php?c=2276047&amp;t=Goudy-Bachman-v.-U.S.-Department-of-Health-and-Human-Services\">against the mandate</a> on Sept. 13, 2011, but said the rest of the law could stand.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis brings us to the first misleading aspect of the claim. The tone and visuals of the commercial may lead viewers to think that because a Florida judge ruled it unconstitutional, the fate of Obamacare has been decided.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat the commercial doesn&rsquo;t mention is that the Supreme Court has the final say.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe court heard three days of oral arguments in March and could release a verdict by the end of June.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Mandate upheld elsewhere</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJudicial decisions on various challenges have not all been negative on the individual mandate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree federal district judges -- all appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton -- have upheld the mandate since 2010. A <a href=\"http://www.medpagetoday.com/Washington-Watch/Reform/22624\">judge in Detroit</a> did so in an Oct. 7, 2010, decision. The next month, a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/images/stories/blogs/virginia.pdf\">federal judge in Virginia</a> followed suit over a challenge from Liberty University. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/health/policy/23health.html\">And on Feb. 22, 2012, a district judge in Washington</a>&nbsp;also deemed the individual mandate constitutional.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd even though the U.S. Appeals panel in Atlanta isn&rsquo;t keen on the insurance requirement, its counterpart in Cincinnati went the other way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals panel, by 2-to-1 approval, declared the provision a &quot;valid exercise of legislative power by Congress under the Commerce clause&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/58040.html\">on June 29, 2011</a>. That was consistent with a lower court&rsquo;s decision on a challenge by the conservative Thomas More Law Center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Fighting back</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGrayson pushed back against the Chamber ad in a May 17, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/os-ed-alan-grayson-tv-ads-myword-051712-20120516,0,5824361.story\"><em>Orlando Sentinel</em> column</a>. He referenced a D.C. newspaper report saying Republicans have no plan to present a health care alternative this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Which means that after almost four years of debate, the national Republican health care plan still is this: Don&#39;t get sick,&quot; he said, sticking by his old catchphrase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe turned the commercial of &quot;brazen lies&quot; into a fundraising appeal to supporters, asking them to contribute to his &quot;Fight Back&quot; Fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Chamber&#39;s ad says, &quot;A Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional.&quot; It&rsquo;s true that a Florida judge ruled parts of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. But the chamber fails to acknowledge that other judges have upheld it, and that the Supreme Court will have the final say this summer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTheir statement is accurate but needs additional clarification.
