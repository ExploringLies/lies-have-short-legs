Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. &hellip; Gov. Pence made the odd claim &mdash; he said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don&#39;t know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine hammered the point again later in the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Gov. Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence, the governor of Indiana, pounced, saying, &quot;That is absolutely inaccurate. &hellip; He said he&#39;s stronger -- he&#39;s been stronger on the world stage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So who was right? A close look at the original comment suggests that both have a point, but neither is fully accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding this claim requires going back to exchanges that occurred about a month earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On several occasions during the campaign, Trump had spoken admiringly of Putin. For instance, in NBC&rsquo;s Commander in Chief Forum on Sept. 7, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/07/donald-trump-promises-massive-increase-to-military-budget-and-sw/\">Trump said</a>, &quot;The man has very strong control over a country. It&#39;s a very different system and I don&#39;t happen to like the system, but certainly, in that system, he&#39;s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following day, Pence was asked about Trump&rsquo;s remark in an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/mike-pence-on-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html\">interview with CNN&#39;s Dana Bash</a> at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Pence supported what his ticket-mate had said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it&#39;s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,&quot; Pence said. &quot;And that&#39;s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Kaine has a point that Pence did say something seemingly favorable to Putin&rsquo;s leadership, saying he&rsquo;d been &quot;a stronger leader&quot; than Obama. But Kaine related the remark inaccurately, saying Pence had said Putin was &quot;a better leader than President Obama.&quot; Pence never used the term &quot;better.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, Trump himself had used the word &quot;better,&quot; at least twice.&nbsp;During a July 27 news conference in Florida, Trump said, &quot;Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn&#39;t know that?&quot; And on the July 28 edition of <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>, Trump did say Putin is &quot;a better leader than Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But during the debate, Kaine didn&rsquo;t say Trump said these things. He said Pence did.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Pence&rsquo;s response to Kaine&rsquo;s jab wasn&rsquo;t airtight, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Pence&rsquo;s counterpunch seemed to conflate his own comments on Putin with Trump&rsquo;s. And second, Trump was never explicit that he was referring to Putin&#39;s role on the &quot;world stage.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate, Kaine said that Pence had &quot;said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence did say something very similar -- but not exactly as Kaine said. Pence had said that Putin &quot;has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country.&quot; However, &quot;stronger&quot; is not identical to &quot;better.&quot; We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-05T13:49:10.200931", "ruling_date": "2016-10-05T17:01:20", "ruling_headline": "Tim Kaine recalls Mike Pence comment on Vladimir Putin", "ruling_headline_slug": "tim-kaine-recalls-mike-pence-comment-putin-stronge", "ruling_link_text": "Pence said 'stronger,' not 'better'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Tim Kaine, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/04/the-mike-pence-vs-tim-kaine-vice-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/\">remarks</a> in the vice presidential debate, Oct. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Telegraph</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/07/donald-trump-promises-massive-increase-to-military-budget-and-sw/\">Donald Trump says Vladimir Putin more of a leader than President Obama</a>,&quot; Sept. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN. &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/politics/mike-pence-on-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html\">Mike Pence defends Donald Trump comments on Vladimir Putin: &#39;inarguable,&#39;</a> &quot; Sept. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steven Cheung, spokesman for Donald Trump, Oct. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Hillary Clinton, Oct. 5, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Tim", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 424, "last_name": "Kaine", "mostly_true_count": 15, "name_slug": "tim-kaine", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_NCCB111_CAMPAIGN_2016_KA.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/424/", "total_count": 57, "true_count": 12, "website": "http://www.kaine.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Gov.
