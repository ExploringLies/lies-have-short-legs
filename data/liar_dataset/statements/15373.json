We got 12,000 people off the street,&quot; Newsom said during a gubernatorial debate in San Jose on May 8, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event was broadcast statewide on NBC and NPR stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom is a Democrat and California&rsquo;s lieutenant governor. He was San Francisco&rsquo;s mayor from January 2004 through January 2011. Before that, he served eight years on the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors starting in January 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polls show Newsom is currently the favorite in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoever becomes California&rsquo;s next governor will be faced with a growing homeless crisis, one made worse by a lack of affordable housing. Homelessness in the state shot up nearly 14 percent in 2017, as it remained flat nationwide, according to federal data and our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/mar/27/travis-allen/has-californias-homeless-population-skyrocketed-an/\">recent fact check</a> on the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the importance of the issue, we wanted to know whether Newsom got his facts right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started by examining Newsom&rsquo;s claim about a 40 percent reduction in the city&rsquo;s &quot;street population,&quot; which includes people living outside, in abandoned buildings, tents, cars and storage structures. It&rsquo;s a subset of the city&rsquo;s overall homeless population, which includes people living in emergency shelters and transitional housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some might interpret Newsom&rsquo;s statement as meaning the city&rsquo;s <em>overall </em>homeless population dropped significantly during his time in office. That&rsquo;s not the case. But because Newsom twice referenced &quot;street population,&quot; we examined that category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though he doesn&rsquo;t give a timeframe, we assumed Newsom was speaking mainly about his tenure as mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan Click, Newsom&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, said the candidate&rsquo;s statement is supported when comparing street population totals from 2002 to 2009, or two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey does show the total dropped 40 percent, from 4,535 individuals to 2,709.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/10410425/screen%20shot%20Newsom%20homeless.JPG\" style=\"height:818px; width:1028px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2011, however, the city&rsquo;s street total climbed to 3,100, a gain of about 400 people over Newsom&rsquo;s final two years as mayor, according to the <a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2011SanFranciscoHomelessComprehensiveReport_FINAL.pdf\">city survey</a> from that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trent Rhorer, who served as Newsom&rsquo;s homeless czar, has worked as executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency since 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said the increase during the last part of Newsom&rsquo;s tenure took place &quot;in the context of a massive recession&quot; that forced many onto the streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rhorer said it was also driven by the shuttering of several nonprofit homeless programs, including two drop-in centers, a shelter and a treatment program when private landlords sold buildings housing those services. Even considering the uptick in the last two years of Newsom&rsquo;s term, the city&rsquo;s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011, he noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The executive director added that the city&rsquo;s overall homeless population held steady from 2009 to 2011, hovering near 6,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is homelessness solved? Absolutely not,&quot; Rhorer said, but Newsom &quot;got results.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12,000 people off the streets? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rohrer also explained the 12,000 figure. He said it represents the total number of people removed from the streets through two strategies from January 2004 through November 2010, a period that nearly spans Newsom&rsquo;s time as mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city placed about 7,000 in permanent housing programs, while the remainder left the streets with a bus ticket through Homeward Bound, a program that&rsquo;s been criticized by some homeless advocacy groups as simply moving the problem to another city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris Herring, a doctoral candidate of sociology at UC Berkeley who studies homelessness, <a href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-expanding-program-bused-10k-homeless-residents-town-past-decade/\">told <em>The San Francisco Examiner</em></a><em> </em>in June 2016 the program &quot;should not be used as a policy to boost up numbers or some vision that San Francisco is ending homelessness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rohrer described Homeward Bound as a well-vetted and voluntary program that connected homeless street people with caretakers who agreed to take them in. It included three follow-up phone calls by city officials, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Overall homeless numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s statement does not reflect the slight increase in San Francisco&rsquo;s overall homeless population during his time as mayor. The first available report during his tenure, from January 2005, shows a total of <a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/San_Francisco_Homeless_Count_2005_Final_Report.pdf\">6,248</a>. By January 2011, Newsom&rsquo;s final month in office, that number was <a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2011SanFranciscoHomelessComprehensiveReport_FINAL.pdf\">6,455</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s most recent overall count, from June 2017, places the total at <a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-SF-Point-in-Time-Count-General-FINAL-6.21.17.pdf\">7,499</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the homeless crisis continues in San Francisco, Newsom has been credited as a leader on the topic. A 2010&nbsp;<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Newsom-gets-homeless-off-streets-problems-linger-2454177.php\">article</a>&nbsp;said Newsom&nbsp;had &quot;moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city&#39;s history - and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yet many of San Francisco&#39;s neighborhoods,&quot; the article continued, &quot;remain plagued with panhandlers, and residents and tourists alike complain of feeling scared or just plain disgusted.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed at a gubernatorial debate that, &quot;In San Francisco, we were successful in reducing our street population 40 percent. We got 12,000 people off the street.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His campaign spokesman pointed to a city homeless survey that shows for one selective window of time, 2002 to 2009, San Francisco reduced its homeless street population by 40 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that report ignores the last two years of Newsom&rsquo;s tenure as mayor. Looking at those years, we found San Francisco&rsquo;s homeless street population jumped by 400, diminishing the reduction Newsom described at the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We interpreted his statement as reflecting his full tenure as mayor, not part of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom also spoke of just one segment of the homeless population -- those on the streets, but not the overall total including people in shelters. The overall total has gone up, not down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His claim that &quot;We got 12,000 people off the street,&quot; is supported by statements from his former homeless czar. It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that the city used Homeward Bound, a bus ticket program, to move about 5,000 of those people out of San Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsom&rsquo;s overall statement is partially accurate. But the first portion uses a cherry-picked timeframe that ignores the last quarter of Newsom&rsquo;s term as mayor. The second part of his claim leaves out some key context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Newsom&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>HALF TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-10T14:34:47.275260", "ruling_date": "2018-05-10T14:05:02", "ruling_headline": "Gavin Newsom's Half True claim on reducing San Francisco\u2019s homeless \u2018street population\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-gavin-newsom-help-san-francisco-reduce-its-hom", "ruling_link_text": "Claim ignores uptick at end of Newsom's tenure", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gavin Newsom, gubernatorial debate, May 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan Click, Newsom&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, phone interview May 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trent Rhorer, exec executive director, San Francisco Human Services Agency, phone interview May 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-SF-Point-in-Time-Count-General-FINAL-6.21.17.pdf\">2017 San Francisco Homeless Count &amp; Survey</a>, accessed May 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2011SanFranciscoHomelessComprehensiveReport_FINAL.pdf\">2011 San Francisco County Homeless Count and Survey</a>, accessed May 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HomelessCountFINALReportSF2009.pdf\">2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey</a>, accessed May 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://hsh.sfgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/San_Francisco_Homeless_Count_2005_Final_Report.pdf\">San Francisco Homeless Count 2005</a>, accessed May 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact California, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/mar/27/travis-allen/has-californias-homeless-population-skyrocketed-an/\">Has California&rsquo;s homeless population &lsquo;skyrocketed&rsquo;?
