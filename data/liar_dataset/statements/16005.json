Then Walker himself attacks, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tony Evers? Well, he&rsquo;ll raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker has made claims like that in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEjO-mn74R8\">three</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOTPrMEatWE\">more</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Oh_FI1iIE\">TV ads</a>.

Evers responded more generally by saying: &quot;I would support looking at anything, whether it&rsquo;s removing tax credits, whether it&rsquo;s slimming down state government, whether it&rsquo;s gas taxes. Everything is on the table.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. &quot;The only thing I ever said about that,&quot; Evers declared, &quot;is that every possible revenue source is on the table.&quot; Evers has not said how much of an increase in the gas tax he could back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evers has also said, in speaking about road funding, that <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/08/16/scott-walker-tony-evers-arent-spelling-out-their-plans-roads/1008438002/\">he would consider</a> increasing the gas tax or implementing tolls.

So, that will result in higher income taxes for those who have taken advantage of the credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On property taxes, Evers acknowledges that his proposed budget for the state Department of Instruction could result in higher property taxes in some school districts and lower levies in others. By lifting revenue limits, however, Evers would be allowing school districts to increase property taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while Evers has said he is open to raising the gas tax, he hasn&rsquo;t said he would seek any particular increase and has flatly denied that it would be $1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover,&nbsp;while Evers is open to raising taxes, it&#39;s not across-the-board, at least in the case of property and income taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Walker a Half True.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Join us for PolitiFact chat</strong><br />\r\nInterested in the U.S. Senate race?
