There&#39;s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannity later read an altered version of the same quote as part of a question for Trump about Russia&rsquo;s election meddling. Hannity repeated the claim a third time while interviewing guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Hannity did not mention, however, was that Obama&rsquo;s remarks actually came in response to a reporter&rsquo;s question about <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/search/?q=voter+fraud\">voter fraud</a> and Trump&rsquo;s claims that the election could be rigged. Obama was not making reference to Russian interference. (For more on Russia&rsquo;s election meddling, read our on-the-record <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jul/16/russia-investigation-donald-trump-timeline-updated/\">timeline</a> of events.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Donald Trump is telling his supporters that the election is rigged and asking them to monitor certain areas on election day,&quot; NPR&rsquo;s Ayesha Rascoe said. &quot;How concerned are you about the potential for violence? And what about after election day &mdash; are you worried the results of the election may be distrusted?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more complete version of Obama&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&amp;v=UvdD0gkMPA8\">response</a> can be read below, with the portions referenced by Hannity in bold:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It&#39;s unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts. Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology &mdash; conservative or liberal &mdash; who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;If you start whining before the game is even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose you start blaming somebody else, then you don&rsquo;t have what it takes to be in this job. Because there are a lot of times when things don&rsquo;t go our way, or my way. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s okay. You fight through it, you work through it. You try to accomplish your goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;But the larger point that I want to emphasize here is that <strong>there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America&rsquo;s elections</strong>, in part because they&rsquo;re so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved. <strong>There&rsquo;s no evidence that that has happened in the past, or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.</strong> And so I&rsquo;d advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannity is not the first person to pluck out this quote. Trump, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1018886665580904454\">appeared</a> to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s denial of Russian election interference during a press conference before Hannity&rsquo;s interview, did the same in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/965928352614965248?lang=en\">tweets</a> on Feb. 20, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(Obama) thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;rock the boat,&rsquo;&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965930611272712192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E965930611272712192&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2018%2F02%2Ftrumps-misguided-comparison%2F\">wrote</a>. &quot;When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17032210/trump-obama-rigged-election-russia\">news</a> and <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/trumps-misguided-comparison/\">fact-checking</a> websites pointed out that Trump took Obama&rsquo;s words out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Obama administration did receive some criticism for its quiet response to Russian interference, which the administration learned of in the months leading up to the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as we have noted in previous <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-barack-obama-did-nothing-about-r/\">fact-checks</a>, it is an exaggeration to say Obama did nothing. By the Oct. 28, 2016, press conference, Obama had personally confronted Putin about it at the G20 Summit in China. Intelligence agencies under Obama&rsquo;s administration had also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/us-formally-accuses-russia-of-stealing-dnc-emails.html\">accused</a> Russia of being responsible for hacking and leaking emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, issuing a <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2016/item/1635-joint-dhs-and-odni-election-security-statement\">joint statement</a> from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Obama did show concern &mdash; and he was responding to Trump&rsquo;s early claims of a rigged election based on voter fraud when he made the comment Hannity singled out. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Hannity&rsquo;s side, a Fox News spokesperson&nbsp;pointed to reports from <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.washingtonpost.com_news_the-2Dfix_wp_2017_06_23_even-2Ddemocrats-2Dwanted-2Dobama-2Dto-2Dspeak-2Dout-2Dmuch-2Dsooner-2Dabout-2Drussia_-3Futm-5Fterm-3D.580164dea072&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=Yg_qrQW8IcJ8HtI-toNw-WVZ3ju2ZsNQ0c1ljSgvjWc&amp;m=YKDmetgvpsj2fD7DTzjxp_2cBIz5uBF5-hDSY1bJ_LE&amp;s=UgHvru-TEbPcEOz-AwYsQBXKbFlUyR_jcZcUCloPdaM&amp;e=\">the Washington Post</a> and <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.reuters.com_article_us-2Dusa-2Dtrump-2Drussia-2Delection_russians-2Dcompromised-2Delection-2Dsystems-2Din-2Dseven-2Dstates-2Dnbc-2Dnews-2DidUSKCN1GC01E&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=Yg_qrQW8IcJ8HtI-toNw-WVZ3ju2ZsNQ0c1ljSgvjWc&amp;m=YKDmetgvpsj2fD7DTzjxp_2cBIz5uBF5-hDSY1bJ_LE&amp;s=hqwcMZa0243pW9Z6haVO3znraFH5h685FZgVDJy1Rmk&amp;e=\">Reuters</a> that former President Barack Obama was informed of Russian meddling as early as the summer of 2016, months before he stated that &quot;there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America&rsquo;s elections.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannity said, &quot;In 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls &mdash; oh, just before the election &mdash; it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quote Hannity used was out of context when presented as the basis of a misleading argument about Obama&rsquo;s response to Russian meddling.
