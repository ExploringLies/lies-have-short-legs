Take U.S. Rep.

We&#39;ve written a lot about credit default swaps --&nbsp; an investment that paid Greene hundreds of millions of dollars when other people&#39;s mortgages went bust, or their properties fell into foreclosure -- read <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/22/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-jeff-greene-credit-default-swap/\">here,</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/28/jeff-greene/greene-claims-banks-need-derivatives-make-loans/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jul/30/kendrick-meek/warren-buffett-was-talking-about-derivatives-gener/\">here</a> for a primer. But that&#39;s not what we noticed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat caught our eye were the images that filled the screen when a narrator uttered this line, &quot;Jeff Greene can buy anything, except the truth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe images included a picture of Greene from one of his ads, a picture of him on a yacht and a picture of two houses. One is labeled &quot;Mansion.&quot; The other is &quot;Mansion 2.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreene is worth a small fortune -- a required federal disclosure lists his assets as <a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-07-23/news/os-greene-discloses-finances-20100723_1_disclosure-forms-real-estate-democratic-senate\" id=\"efa6\" title=\"ranging in value between $827 million and $2.8 billion\">ranging in value between $827 million and $2.8 billion</a>. So we&#39;re not surprised the man would own two large homes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we wanted to see if the Meek campaign had done its homework and produced real pictures of the homes. Or if the pictures were generic images of palacial digs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA bit of Internet searching reveals the answer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe first checked the <a href=\"http://www.pbcgov.com/papa/index.htm\" id=\"jrur\" title=\"Palm Beach County Property Appraiser\">Palm Beach County Property Appraiser</a> to see about property Greene owns in his hometown. According to records, Greene dropped $24 million on a waterfront home in December 2009. We&#39;re not going to list the address here, but using the address, we were able to find the original for-sale listing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe nine bedroom, nine bathroom home was listed through The Corcoran Group. From the listing:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Mizner&#39;s Coconut Hill - 234&#39; Direct Oceanfront - Beautifully sited on 3.8 +/- acres, this unique compound boasts a long winding entry and limitless ocean vistas. Offering total privacy and approximately 12,000 square feet of well scaled living spaces, its original finishes remain: limestone, pecky cypress, stone/hardwood floors, french Palladian doors and more. Gracious outdoor terraces &amp; an elegant oversized swimming pool complete this spectacular property that awaits a restoration and potential expansion.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe listing included this photo <a href=\"http://www.corcoran.com/property/PhotoTour.aspx?Region=FL&amp;ListingID=5170\" id=\"f3tl\" title=\"gallery\">gallery</a>. Sure enough, the home is indeed what&#39;s called &quot;Mansion&quot; in Meek&#39;s campaign ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for &quot;Mansion 2,&quot; the property isn&#39;t in Florida at all, but rather California. It&#39;s a 25-acre estate in Beverly Hills he calls Palazzo di Amore.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd it&#39;s Greene&#39;s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe used to live there but now is renting out&nbsp;the 43,000-square-foot home for $25,000 a month. (The home is still on the market, <a href=\"http://www.stacygottula.com/current.html\" id=\"kk7s\" title=\"according to a Realtor's website\">according to a Realtor&#39;s website</a>, if you&#39;re interested). The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> profiled the property last October.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Mr. Greene ... bought the unfinished property out of receivership for $35 million in 2006 and has spent nearly three years and $15 million finishing it. The 43,000 square foot main house has 11 bedrooms, 14 baths and a 6,000 square foot ballroom. Six acres of vineyards produce 400 cases of wine annually.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704597704574487291407502778.html\" id=\"czyh\" title=\"Journal article\"><em>Journal</em> article</a> includes what appears to be the same image that is in Meek&#39;s ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the record, Realtors <a href=\"http://theluxurybrokers.com/mansions_for_sale.htm\" id=\"t83m\" title=\"define\">define</a> a mansion as a home bigger than 8,000 square feet -- meaning both Greene properties qualify.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd if you were wondering, the picture of Greene on the yacht is legit, too.
