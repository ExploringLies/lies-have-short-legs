We checked to see if that was true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe national debt stands at $14.3 trillion. Nearly $6 trillion of that is held by the Federal Reserve and U.S. government agencies in various funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rest of the amount, about $8.3 trillion, is &quot;privately-held&quot; debt owed to mutual funds, pension funds, foreign investors and other bond holders.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no doubt China holds a lot of U.S. government debt. In fact, it&rsquo;s the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury securities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs of March 2011, China owned about $1.2 trillion of U.S. debt - more than a quarter of the total $4.5 trillion in U.S. treasuries held by foreign investors, according to statistics from the U.S. Treasury Department. But the rest of the roughly $3.8 trillion of privately held debt was owned by United States investors such as banks, pension funds and mutual funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo there&rsquo;s no way that China owns more U.S. debt than domestic investors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Bill Riggs, an Allen campaign spokesman, told us that when the former governor said China held more bonds than Americans, he was referring to debt held by ordinary American investors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo support that narrower contention, the Allen campaign sent us a couple of reports from the U.S. Treasury to argue that regular American investors&rsquo; U.S. debt holdings were less than China&rsquo;s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen&rsquo;s campaign pointed to an April 2011 Treasury report showing the June 2010 amount of foreign holdings of U.S. securities, which includes treasury securities as well as other investments including stocks and debt owed by U.S. agencies.According to the report, China had $1.6 trillion of U.S. securities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRiggs then sent us a Treasury Department table showing the breakdown of how much U.S. Treasuries are held by various classes of investors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat chart breaks out holders of U.S. treasuries into about 10 groups such as U.S. banks, savings bonds, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, foreign investors, state and local governments and a miscellaneous &quot;other investors&quot; category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRiggs said the campaign tallied up the total debt held by what Allen termed American investors. Allen&rsquo;s campaign included debt tied up in U.S.savings bonds, private pension funds, state and local government pensions and mutual funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInvestors in those funds held a total of $1.5 trillion of debt in June 2010, Riggs said. The Allen campaign did not include in its calculations U.S. Treasury debt held by banks, insurance companies, state and local governments outside their pension funds or tallies from the &quot;other investors&quot; category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat $1.5 trillion tally that Allen attributes to American investors is less than the $1.6 trillion attributed to China in Treasury&rsquo;s April report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there are serious flaws with the Allen campaign&rsquo;s reasoning.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst of all, Allen&rsquo;s rationale is an apples-to-oranges comparison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe smaller $1.5 trillion tally for so-called American investors only includes U.S. Treasury securities. But the larger $1.6 trillion tally linked to China includes not just Treasury debt, but other investments a well -- such as stocks and corporate debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDerek Scissors, an economist who specializes in Asian affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the two numbers are not measuring the same thing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s not a comparable number,&quot; Scissors said. &quot;They&rsquo;re trying to build a skewed case.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScissors was also skeptical of how the Allen campaign defined debt held by regular American investors. If the Allen campaign was going to count debt held by mutual funds, Scissors wondered why they didn&rsquo;t include debts held by U.S. banks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScissors also said some portion of the &quot;other investors&quot; category, which held $1.2 trillion of U.S. treasury debt in June 2010, would certainly include some debt owned by Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Allen&rsquo;s calculations for American-held debt doesn&rsquo;t count a penny of debt held in that category, which includes debt held by individuals, government-sponsored enterprise and businesses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the record, we checked a pair of Treasury Department charts to get the latest official tally of how much U.S. treasury securities were owned by China. As of December 2010 -- the most recent month for which we could find comparable data -- mainland China and Hong Kong (which are reported separately) together held nearly $1.3 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities. In that same month, the investor categories comprising Allen&rsquo;s definition of regular investors held $1.6 trillion in U.S. securities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo sum up:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen said China owns more U.S. bonds than Americans. That statement is wrong on its face, but the Allen campaign offers a qualifier -- his spokesman said Allen&rsquo;s statement is a reference to regular American investors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the reports Allen cites are not comparable and don&rsquo;t even prove that narrower assertion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOfficial debt tallies, even using Allen&rsquo;s definition of ordinary American investors, show U.S. citizens held more government debt than China.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs an added defense, Allen&rsquo;s campaign said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in February testified before Congress that he thinks China owns more than $2 trillion of U.S. government bonds. That still doesn&rsquo;t prove Allen&rsquo;s point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bottom line is that Allen&rsquo;s methodology of including some U.S. investors and ignoring others is highly questionable, and his evidence doesn&rsquo;t add up to his conclusion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim False.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-08T14:36:50.082229", "ruling_date": "2011-07-08T14:32:46", "ruling_headline": "Allen says China owns more U.S. bonds than Americans", "ruling_headline_slug": "allen-says-china-owns-more-us-bonds-americans", "ruling_link_text": "Cherry picks data", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNBC 29 WVIR-TV story, <a href=\"http://www.nbc29.com/story/15018095/allen-and-kaine-campaign-in-crozet-on-foot-and-horseback\">&quot;Allen and Kaine campaign in Crozet on foot and horseback,&quot;</a>, July 2, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Bill Riggs, Allen campaign spokesman, July 7, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Bill Riggs, July 7, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Barry Bosworth, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, July 6, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Derek Scissors, an Asia economist at the Hertitage Foundation, July 6, 2011 and July 7, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Treasury, &quot;<a href=\"http://fms.treas.gov/bulletin/b2011_2ofs.doc\">Ownership of federal securities,&quot;</a>June 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt\">&quot;Major foreign holders of treasury securities,&quot;</a>accessed July 7, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHeritage Foundation report, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/02/chinese-investment-in-the-us-$2-trillion-and-counting\">Chinese investment in the U.S., $2 trillion and counting,&quot;</a>March 1, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBloomberg, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-09/americans-biggest-buyers-of-treasuries-as-savers-support-record-low-rates.html\">&quot;U.S</a>. investors regain majority holding of treasuries,&quot;Aug. 9, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/shla2010r.pdf\">&quot;Report on foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities,&quot;</a>April 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCNN Money, <a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/02/09/our-dollar-chinas-2-trillion-problem/\">&quot;Our dollar, China&rsquo;s $2 trillion problem,&quot;</a>February 9, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Research Service, <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33536.pdf\">&quot;China-U.S. trade issues,&quot;</a>June 2, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/22/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-china-holds-26-percent-us-debt/\">&quot;Herman Cain says China holds 26 percent of U.S. Debt,&quot;</a>April 22, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/jun/14/allen-west/rep-allen-west-says-china-holds-29-percent-us-debt/\">&quot;Rep.
