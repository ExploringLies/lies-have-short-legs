Scott Walker since the race began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelda Roys, a former state representative from Madison and one of eight Democratic contenders, has been sharp with criticism as it relates to jobs and the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a May 15, 2018 meet-and-greet in downtown Madison, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/keldaroys/videos/10155622582309077/\">she told those in attendance</a>: &quot;Just last year alone, we lost 4,000 manufacturing jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That echoed a claim from a series of tweets on April 18, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one tweet, Roys wrote: &quot;Households in Wisconsin have paid over $500 for one of Walker&rsquo;s corporate tax giveaways. Much of the giveaway went to just a handful of the richest Wisconsinites and it didn&rsquo;t stop our state from losing almost 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manufacturing jobs are critical to Wisconsin&rsquo;s economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the most recent annual data from December 2017, the state ranks 9th in the nation in total manufacturing jobs -- and those jobs are responsible for 16 percent of total employment in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did Wisconsin really lose 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Campaign admits error </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted the Roys campaign to ask for backup to the claim, communications director Brian Evans basically said, &quot;Oops.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The tweet should have said 2016 instead of 2017, and we fully admit that this was an error on our part,&quot; Evans said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics and its <a href=\"https://beta.bls.gov/maps/cew/US?period=2016-Q4&amp;industry=1013&amp;pos_color=blue&amp;neg_color=orange&amp;Update=Update&amp;chartData=2&amp;ownerType=5&amp;distribution=Quantiles#tab1\">Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages</a>, Wisconsin lost 3,726 manufacturing jobs between December 2015 and December 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if Roys had actually focused on 2016 instead of 2017 her claim would be on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even then, that gives a narrow picture of what has happened with manufacturing jobs under Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other years</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From December 2016 to December 2017, the most recent full year available, Wisconsin gained 8,032 manufacturing jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. This was a 1.7 percent increase in manufacturing jobs, bringing the statewide total to 469,453.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, Wisconsin ranked 7th among states with the highest percentage of growth in manufacturing jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we have the charts out, how has Walker done since taking office?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2010, the month before Walker took office, there were 434,723 manufacturing jobs. In December 2017, the most recent full-year available, there were 469,453.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a 34,730 -- or 8 percent -- increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Twitter and on the campaign trail, Roys has said Wisconsin lost nearly 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roys has her years mixed up -- and her campaign admits it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Roys would have been right for 2016, growth in 2017 was roughly double the loss in 2016. Compared to the start of Walker&rsquo;s term, there has been an 8 percent increase in manufacturing employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-19T15:36:25.285678", "ruling_date": "2018-07-23T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gubernatorial candidate Kelda Roys falsely attacks Scott Walker for loss in manufacturing jobs ", "ruling_headline_slug": "gubernatorial-candidate-kelda-roys-falsely-attacks", "ruling_link_text": "Wrong year, distorted picture", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook Live, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/keldaroys/videos/10155622582309077/\">Kelda Roys live at Brocach</a>, March 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keldahelenroys/status/986666899315535873\">Kelda Roys tweets</a>, April, 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Brian Evans, Communications Director for the Kelda Roys Campaign, June 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Austin Altenberg, Press Secretary for Friends of Scott Walker, July 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"https://beta.bls.gov/maps/cew/US?period=2017-Q4&amp;industry=1013&amp;pos_color=blue&amp;neg_color=orange&amp;Update=Update&amp;chartData=2&amp;ownerType=5&amp;distribution=Quantiles#tab1\">Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages</a> Q4 2010-Q4104, July 17, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Kelda Helen", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 1628, "last_name": "Roys", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "kelda-helen-roys", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT__Kelda_Roys.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1628/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Wisconsin lost &quot;almost 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet and campaign event", "statement_date": "2018-04-18", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}], "twitter_headline": "Kelda Roys falsely attacks Scott Walker for a loss in manufacturing jobs in 2017"}
