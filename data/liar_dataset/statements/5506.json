Rush Holt says the federal mandate requiring most health care plans to offer free contraceptive coverage makes sense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd he claims a majority of Americans agree with him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFierce debate on the issue erupted when guidelines issued by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department that required insurance plans to cover birth control as preventive services, without co-pays or deductibles, were made final without exemptions for some employers with religious affiliations. On Feb. 10, President Barack Obama announced a compromise: if a religious-affiliated employer objected to providing contraceptive coverage, the responsibility would fall on the insurance company.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a Feb. 24 e-mail newsletter explaining his support for Obama&rsquo;s decision, Holt (D- 12th Dist.) said: &quot;Nearly all American women, including women of faith, have used contraception sometimes, and a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur colleagues at PolitiFact national recently ruled on a claim that addressed the first half of Holt&rsquo;s statement. A White House official said: &quot;Most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception.&quot; That claim earned a Mostly True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith the birth control plan still under fierce scrutiny, we questioned Holt&rsquo;s other claim. Despite all the rancor, do Americans favor the plan?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolt&rsquo;s spokesman, Thomas Seay, pointed to a February health tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that 63 percent of respondents support the &quot;new federal requirement that private health insurance plans cover the cost of birth control&quot; and 33 percent oppose it. The margin of error was 3 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s just one poll of 1,519 adults. We found seven other surveys that asked respondents about their views on requiring health care plans to cover birth control. Five support Holt&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA CBS News/New York Times poll found an even larger majority of Americans -- 66 percent -- support the plan requiring private health insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control. About a quarter of respondents opposed the plan, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points. When asked specifically about the same requirement for employers with religious affiliations, support decreased slightly, with 61 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA recent Fox News poll found 61 percent of respondents supported &quot;requiring employer health plans to cover birth control for women&quot; and 34 percent opposed. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA survey by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling conducted on behalf of Planned Parenthood and a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute both found majorities in support of employers providing health care plans that would cover the cost of birth control<a href=\"http://coverage.do/\">.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother poll conducted for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found 53 percent of respondents favored the requirement and 33 percent opposed it, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. That&rsquo;s a majority, but one that could possibly be affected by the margin of error.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo of the polls we reviewed found opposition to providing free birth control coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Quinnipiac University poll with a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points found a split of 47 percent in support of requiring private employers to offer free birth control coverage and 48 percent opposed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports -- widely considered Republican-leaning -- found 46 percent opposed the plan and 43 percent supported it. The survey had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolt &nbsp;said &quot;a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found eight polls that recently asked respondents whether they supported or opposed requiring health care plans to cover the cost of birth control.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn six of those surveys there was majority support, only one of which could be impacted by a margin of error. Two others polls showed more opposition than support. Still, Holt&rsquo;s claim is backed by most of the polls we reviewed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, this claim is Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/politifact_nj_rush_holt_says_a.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-08T17:37:44.217986", "ruling_date": "2012-03-12T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Rush Holt claims a clear majority of Americans support plan to provide free prescription contraceptive coverage ", "ruling_headline_slug": "rush-holt-claims-clear-majority-americans-support-", "ruling_link_text": "Most surveys show support", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. Rep.
