That page contained a statement that began with this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>House Republicans are quickly moving to pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan. This is another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights. Leading the charge has been House Speaker Paul Ryan.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NARAL made <a href=\"https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Personhood-ad-1.jpg\">similar</a> <a href=\"https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Personhood-ad-3.jpg\">claims</a> on social media. And <a href=\"https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/2017/11/09/tax-bill-ad-buy/\">the group said</a> that, besides Ryan, the online ads targeted eight other House Republicans: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rod-blum/\">Rod Blum</a> of Iowa, Steve Knight and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/darrell-issa/\">Darrell Issa</a> of California, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mike-coffman/\">Mike Coffman</a> of Colorado, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barbara-comstock/\">Barbara Comstock</a> of Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/karen-handel/\">Karen Handel</a> of Georgia and Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at each of the three parts of the attack on Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. &lsquo;Ryan is leading the effort&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/text\">The House tax bill</a> was introduced on Nov. 2, 2017, and was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/16/house-poised-vote-tax-overhaul-bigger-battle-lies-ahead/869171001/\">approved by the House</a> on Nov. 16, 2017, the day after NARAL&rsquo;s ad on JSOnline.com. Ryan <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/09/07/paul-ryan-tax-reform-is-our-number-one-priority-this-fall.html\">has</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/11/07/562640983/gop-tax-bill-could-pass-the-house-by-next-week\">long</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/paul-ryan-wants-the-house-to-pass-a-tax-bill-by-thanksgiving.html\">been</a> <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?436728-1/house-republicans-unveil-tax-reform-plan\">touting</a> a GOP tax reform proposal, describing it as the first major tax reform since 1986, and promising that its tax cuts and other tax changes would stimulate the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman in the speaker&rsquo;s office told us Ryan supports the provision that is targeted by NARAL, which would change so-called 529 college savings accounts. But she said she wasn&rsquo;t aware of any public statement Ryan has made on that provision, and we couldn&rsquo;t find any, which indicates Ryan hasn&rsquo;t taken the lead on pushing that particular provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, this part of the claim is partially accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. &lsquo;Conception language disguised as savings plan&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People use <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/529-plans-questions-and-answers\">529 accounts</a> (529 refers to that section of the tax code) as <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/how-529-plans-help-families-save-for-college-and-how-the-american-recovery-and-reinvestment-act-of-2009-expanded-529-plan-features\">investment vehicles</a> to save money for college expenses. The savings are for -- as the Internal Revenue Service explains it -- &quot;a designated beneficiary, such as a child or grandchild.&quot; A key attraction is that earnings on investments are not subject to federal tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House tax bill <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/02/gop-tax-bill-abortion-rights-college-savings-244486\">would</a> <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2017/11/03/lets-talk-about-the-gop-proposal-to-give-a-fetus-a-tax-benefit/\">allow</a> 529 accounts to be opened explicitly for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/politics/tax-bill-unborn-children.html\">unborn</a> <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/pf/college/house-tax-plan-unborn-child-529/index.html\">children</a>. That provision says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nothing shall prevent an unborn child from being treated as a designated beneficiary or an individual under this section. The term &quot;unborn child&quot; means a child in utero. The term &quot;child in utero&quot; means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision is &quot;disguised&quot; in the sense that adding the unborn child language doesn&rsquo;t enable savers to do anything they can&rsquo;t already do for future children -- a point U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/judy-chu/\">Judy Chu</a>, D-Calif., <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepJudyChu/status/927629064478830592\">raised during a hearing</a>. Expectant parents and other savers <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2013/10/09/unborn-children-and-the-college-tax-dodge/#218f00e76947\">can already</a> open a 529 in <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/abortion-foes-are-cheering-provision-new-gop-tax-bill-n817081\">anyone&rsquo;s name</a>, including their own, and later <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/529-plans-questions-and-answers\">change the beneficiary</a> -- for instance, after a child is born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s clear the provision is divisive. NARAL is among a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/abortion/tax-bill-includes-language-designed-undermine-abortion-rights\">number</a> of <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/pf/college/house-tax-plan-unborn-child-529/index.html\">groups</a> that opposes it; meanwhile, anti-abortion <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/abortion-foes-are-cheering-provision-new-gop-tax-bill-n817081\">groups</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/02/gop-tax-bill-abortion-rights-college-savings-244486\">support</a> the provision, with one, the Susan B. Anthony List, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/abortion-foes-are-cheering-provision-new-gop-tax-bill-n817081\">saying</a>: &quot;It&#39;s a small increment in the momentum that we&#39;re building to ensure that one day every child is welcomed and protected under the law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, this part of the claim is mostly on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. &lsquo;Another attempt to ban abortion&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third part of the claim, however, goes too far. The 529 provision would not ban abortion; it strictly deals with college savings accounts, not any restrictions on abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, in announcing its ads, <a href=\"https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/2017/11/14/naral-calls-unprecedented-anti-choice-hypocrisy-senate-tax-plan/\">NARAL itself labeled</a> the provision as merely a beginning step, saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The sole purpose of this provision is to codify the radical, anti-choice idea that life begins at conception into law and begin the process of banning abortion altogether &hellip;.This is the first time &lsquo;personhood&rsquo; language has made it into tax reform legislation, leaving the door open for future laws to use the same, ideological definition of when life begins &hellip;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is evidence that, as the New York Times reported, &quot;the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/politics/tax-bill-unborn-children.html\">recognition of the unborn</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anti-abortion group March for Life said in <a href=\"http://marchforlife.org/march-life-statement-tax-plan/\">a statement</a>: &quot;We are heartened to see this bill promote the personhood of an unborn child &hellip; and see this as a huge stride toward expanding the child tax credit to recognize life beginning at conception.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes fact checked whether the tax provision attempts to <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/gop-tax-bill-fetal-personhood-legislation/\">codify &quot;fetal personhood&quot;</a> &mdash; the legal theory that a fetus has the same legal rights as a person -- and found the claim largely accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two experts, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/gop-tax-bill-fetal-personhood-legislation/\">echoing</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/6/16602744/republicans-tax-bill-abortion-rights\">others</a>, told us that inserting an unborn child definition into federal law is part of a broader strategy to limit abortion rights in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is part of the anti-abortion strategy to work on all fronts to establish fetal personhood/citizenship claims,&quot; said Yale Law School professor <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/centers-workshops/gruber-program-global-justice-and-womens-rights/about-us\">Mindy Roseman</a>, whose specialties include reproduction rights. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;unborn child&quot; or human &quot;from moment of conception&quot; language is also in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; strategic plan, said University of Wisconsin-Madison law and bioethics professor <a href=\"http://law.wisc.edu/profiles/racharo\">Alta Charo</a>, whose specialties include reproductive health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such efforts are aimed, she said, &quot;at building an impression that everywhere in federal law the embryo and fetus is considered morally and perhaps legally equal to a live-born child. It is like building a wall. At the end, abortion stands out as a singular exception, a single missing brick in the wall, and seems harder and harder to justify either morally or constitutionally.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ryan&rsquo;s response</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked to respond to NARAL&rsquo;s ad, Ryan&rsquo;s office referred us to <a href=\"https://www.majorityleader.gov/2017/11/07/dignity-of-life/\">a statement</a> about the provision issued by House Majority Leader <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/kevin-mccarthy/\">Kevin McCarthy</a>, R-Calif. The statement says in part:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Today, our tax code doesn&rsquo;t recognize children with eyes, ears, noses, arms, legs, fingers, and heartbeats as children just because they haven&rsquo;t yet left the womb &hellip;.So our tax plan adds clear language that allows parents to start a college savings account before their son or daughter is born by explicitly and unambiguously declaring these sons and daughters &quot;unborn children.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NARAL says Ryan is leading the effort to &quot;pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan&quot; in &quot;another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan is leading the effort to pass the tax bill. But while he supports the college savings plan provision, he hasn&rsquo;t spoken out publicly to push that provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conception language in the provision is divisive among anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups. And it is &lsquo;disguised&rsquo; in the sense that it inserts the concept of unborn children into federal law without making any material change to what are known as 529 college savings plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision would not, however, ban or even restrict abortion rights -- although advocates fear that inserting unborn children language into federal law could be used to erode abortion rights in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NARAL&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-21T12:51:08.849922", "ruling_date": "2017-11-22T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "The House tax bill contains language about unborn children, but is it an attempt to ban abortion?", "ruling_headline_slug": "house-tax-bill-contains-language-about-unborn-chil", "ruling_link_text": "Accuracy varies on each part of the claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>JSOnline, NARAL ad, Nov. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NARAL, <a href=\"http://actnow.prochoiceamerica.org/sign/171110_personhood-tax-ryan-call_ck/#.WgxseEqnHcs\">&quot;CALL PAUL RYAN: The GOP tax plan shouldn&#39;t say when life begins!&quot;</a> accessed Nov. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, NARAL spokeswoman Maya Hixson, Nov. 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/02/gop-tax-bill-abortion-rights-college-savings-244486\">&quot;&#39;Unborn children&#39;
