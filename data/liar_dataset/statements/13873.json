Our fact check focused on his 37 percent figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s spokesman for evidence. He cited a <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2016\">breakdown of the 2016 election</a> on the website ballotpedia.org. It&rsquo;s an independent, online encyclopedia of American politics and elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, indeed, it lists the average margin of victory for members of the House at 37.1 percent. It notes that&rsquo;s up from the 35.8 percent margin in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked with one more knowledgeable source: <a href=\"https://www.cmc.edu/academic/faculty/profile/john-pitney-jr\">Jack Pitney</a>, a longtime professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College and former director of the Republican National Committee&rsquo;s Research Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pitney crunched last year&rsquo;s election numbers for us and found a 39 percent margin of victory for House members. He said he wasn&rsquo;t sure what accounted for the slight difference in his findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But the bottom line is that Arnold&#39;s point -- House members win by big margins -- is essentially correct,&quot; Pitney said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What accounts for that huge margin? Pitney said part of it is deliberate gerrymandering, and part is that &quot;constituencies are increasingly polarized.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Even in states where you don&rsquo;t have a partisan (redistricting) process, Democrats tend to live in certain places. Republicans tend to live in others,&quot; the professor added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporters of California&rsquo;s redistricting commission say it&rsquo;s created more competitive districts. As an example, some cite <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California%27s_49th_Congressional_District_election,_2016\">California&#39;s 49th Congressional District</a>, where incumbent Republican <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Darrell_Issa\">Darrell Issa</a> defeated Democrat <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Douglas_Applegate\">Douglas Applegate</a> by 0.5 percent of the vote -- the smallest margin of any House race in the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Issa, who&rsquo;s been in Congress since 2000, has won his district by 20 or even 30 percentage points in previous elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/01/californiajust-proved-that-redistricting-reform-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/?utm_term=.1593bccd1cec\">reported in December&nbsp;2016</a>, the commission hasn&rsquo;t led to changes in party control in any of California&rsquo;s 53 congressional districts for several election cycles:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the fourth time in 12 years, not a single one of the state&#39;s 50-plus congressional districts switched parties. Just as in 2010, 2008 and 2004, every single seat returned to the party that previously controlled it,&quot; the <em>Post </em>reported on Dec. 1, 2016, adding that &quot;competitiveness has only ticked up slightly (in California&rsquo;s congressional districts) under the new map.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Pitney how well the commission has performed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a debate about that,&quot; he told us. &quot;Some argue that what appeared to be a nonpartisan process was actually gamed by Democrats. Be that as it may, the real reason for Democratic dominance in congressional elections is there&rsquo;s just a lot more Democrats in California than there are Republicans. The state&rsquo;s been trending heavily Democratic for years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About those dictators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schwarzenegger also mentioned the electoral margins for dictators. That&#39;s not part of this fact-check but we thought it would be fun to check their margins, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, BBC News examined this topic in its article <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-26527422\">&quot;The world of 100% election victories.&quot;</a> Here&rsquo;s what it found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un was elected in 2014 by the communist republic&rsquo;s parliament with 100% votes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il fared almost as well as his son in 2009, winning 99.9 % of votes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Former Iraq President Saddam Hussein also won 100% votes in a 2002 referendum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Cuban President Ra&uacute;l Castro earned 99.4% votes in his 2008 election</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad secured 97.6% votes for his 2007 presidential referendum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed the &nbsp;&quot;average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%&quot; among Republicans and Democrats during last year&rsquo;s election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That claim is supported by the 37.1 percent margin calculated by independent election tracker <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2016\">ballotpedia.org</a> and longtime politics professor <a href=\"https://www.cmc.edu/academic/faculty/profile/john-pitney-jr\">Jack Pitney</a> of Claremont McKenna College, who put the margin slightly higher at 39 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evidence shows Schwarzenegger was on target with his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated it True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;
