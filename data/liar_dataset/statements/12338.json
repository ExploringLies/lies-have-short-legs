Jerry Brown, perhaps tired of the job-poaching efforts of governors in Texas and Florida, shot back at Gov. Scott with claims that the Golden State&rsquo;s job picture is, well, very sunny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As one of the millions of tourists flocking to the Golden State this time of year, we&rsquo;d like to extend a warm welcome to (Florida Gov. Rick Scott). We can understand why he&rsquo;s coming back -- there&rsquo;s lots to do and plenty to learn,&quot; Brown said in a statement on April 26. His office issue a similar&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19399\">press release</a> a few days later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In fact, since his last 2,000 mile cross-country jaunt, California has added twice as many jobs as Florida, while paying down debt, building a robust rainy day fund and taking bold action on issues Governor Scott continues to ignore, like climate change and poverty,&quot; Brown said in the statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>FROM TWITTER</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JerryBrownGov\">@JerryBrownGov</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FLGovScott\">@FLGovScott</a>: Time to stop the silly political stunts &amp; start doing something about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateChange?src=hash\">#ClimateChange</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/nuWwhEBu9I\">pic.twitter.com/nuWwhEBu9I</a></p>\r\n&mdash; Gov.

So we focused just on Brown&rsquo;s statement about California adding twice as many jobs as Florida, and whether there was any context missing. It turns out California&rsquo;s job picture is not really brighter than Florida&rsquo;s, at least not during the period Brown described.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/6723180/Florida%20Gov.%20Rick%20Scott%20gives%20the%20opening%20remarks%20during%20Rick%20Scott's%20Economic%20Growth%20Summit%20in%20Lake%20Buena%20Vista,%20Fla.,%20on%20June%202,%202015.%20(AP%20Photo).JPG\" style=\"height:865px; width:1300px\" /><em>Florida Gov. Rick Scott speaks in 2015 / AP photo</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at data from the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ca.htm\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> for the two states, from May 2015 to March 2016. Scott&rsquo;s first visit was in April 2015. Last month&rsquo;s data was not yet available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this span, California added 354,100 jobs while Florida added 190,500 jobs. That&rsquo;s 1.86 times as many jobs as the Sunshine State -- not quite twice as many but pretty close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s office also pointed to a slightly different time period, January through December 2015, when California added 1.97 times as many jobs as Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, California is a much larger state with 39.1 million people -- almost double Florida&rsquo;s population of 20.3 million. One would expect California to add more jobs than Florida, to keep up with the millions more people who live here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some context, we checked the states&rsquo; job growth rates during this period. Florida had a slightly faster job growth rate at nearly 2.4 percent compared with California&rsquo;s 2.2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov. Jerry Brown said California has added twice as many jobs as Florida since that state&rsquo;s governor visited in April 2015 on a job recruiting tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&#39;s claim is close on the raw numbers. But it leaves out the important context that California is a much larger state that needs to add more jobs to keep its millions more people employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal jobs data show California added 1.86 times as many jobs as Florida during this period, a bit less than twice as many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California often leads the nation in overall job gains due to its sheer size. But the pace of that job growth tells a different story. Florida actually added jobs at a slightly faster rate, nearly 2.4 percent compared with California&rsquo;s 2.2 percent, during the period in question. That takes a lot of the shine off Brown&#39;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated his claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>--------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>HALF&nbsp;TRUE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash; The statement is partially&nbsp;accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(63, 99, 158); transition: color 0.15s ease-in-out, border 0.15s ease-in-out; text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84a7d7ae-cbfc-488f-a9b1-3f61c0f7069e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84a7d7ae-cbfc-488f-a9b1-3f61c0f7069e</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-04T17:59:17.169760", "ruling_date": "2016-05-06T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jerry Brown\u2019s Half True Claim About California Doubling Florida\u2019s Job Gains", "ruling_headline_slug": "jerry-browns-mostly-true-claim-about-california-do", "ruling_link_text": "California added more overall jobs, but Florida added them at a faster rate", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Evan Westrup, spokesman for California Gov.
