It is the most deadly series of fires in California&rsquo;s history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there&rsquo;s a strong desire for answers about what caused the fires, the investigation is still in its early stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact check Breitbart&rsquo;s controversial claim that Gonzalez&nbsp;is now the target of an arson probe connected to the deadly fires, despite arguments to the contrary by authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started by reviewing comments by Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano at a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ktvu/videos/10155080254167061/\">press conference</a> on Oct. 17, 2017, the same day Breitbart&rsquo;s article was published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheriff said his deputies arrested Gonzalez&nbsp;two days earlier on a felony arson charge for allegedly starting &quot;a small fire&quot; that was unconnected to the larger blazes and was quickly put out. Gonzalez, a Sonoma Valley man who sheriff&#39;s officials described as homeless, told deputies he lit the fire to stay warm. A <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/statement-ice-acting-director-sonoma-countys-repeated-releases-dangerous-criminal#wcm-survey-target-id\">statement</a>&nbsp;by federal immigration authorities indicates Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the sheriff&rsquo;s statement at the press conference:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;There&rsquo;s a little rumor control issue. We, the Sonoma County Sheriff&rsquo;s office, arrested a man on Sunday for arson in the Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There&rsquo;s a story out there that he&rsquo;s the arsonist for these fires. That&rsquo;s not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all. CalFire is doing an investigation into how these fires started. We don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s arson.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/9560621/Sonoma%20sheriff%20presser.JPG\" style=\"height:342px; width:677px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano press conference Oct. 17, 2017.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cal Fire, or the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, is in charge of battling the wildfires and is the lead investigative agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel Berlant, Cal Fire&rsquo;s assistant deputy director, told PolitiFact California on Oct. 20, 2017, that its investigation was &quot;ongoing&quot; and that it has &quot;not yet determined any specific causes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He declined to comment specifically on Gonzalez, saying Cal Fire would work with the Sonoma County sheriff&rsquo;s office to investigate anyone suspected in the large fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s a lot of speculation on what may have started the fires. People want to know who is to blame,&quot; Berlant said. &quot;When we have an arson suspect, that&rsquo;s going to be made public immediately.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berlant clarified that the agency has yet to determine whether arson is even the cause of the large fires, adding there are a host of other possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&quot;Completely false, bad, wrong information&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sgt. Spencer Crum, spokesperson for the Sonoma County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, was blunt in describing Breitbart&rsquo;s role in fueling false rumors. Breitbart is run by Steve Bannon, President Trump&#39;s former chief strategist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crum <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/briannasacks/no-an-undocumented-immigrant-did-not-start-the-deadly?utm_term=.kojko57xv#.sfAna0Z4b\">told BuzzFeed</a> on Oct. 19, 2017 that the rumors about Gonzalez are &quot;completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public in a very strong way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crum added in the BuzzFeed article that a Breitbart reporter called the department only to inquire about Gonzalez&#39;s race and if ICE had placed a detainer on him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After they published that story we started getting a lot of calls,&quot; he added. &quot;There is no indication Mr. Gonzalez is connected to the wildfires. None. Breitbart made that up themselves.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Breitbart reporter who wrote the article did not respond to our request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the article, Breitbart also reported that the U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, issued &quot;a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail&quot; for Gonzalez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giordano, the Sonoma County sheriff, confirmed through a <a href=\"http://www.nixle.us/9N8YZ\">statement posted online</a> on Oct. 19, 2017 that ICE made that request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that Gonzalez remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. Half of that is for a misdemeanor drug warrant from Ventura County, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheriff also detailed what he described as several misleading comments by ICE when that agency released a <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/statement-ice-acting-director-sonoma-countys-repeated-releases-dangerous-criminal#wcm-survey-target-id\">statement </a>this week about past detainer requests it made to the Sonoma County sheriff&rsquo;s office related to Gonzalez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An article on the conservative website Breitbart recently claimed that Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who federal officials have indicated is an undocumented immigrant,&nbsp;&quot;was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordono said deputies arrested Gonzalez for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. The sheriff added that &quot;there is no indication he is related to these fires at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Cal Fire spokesman said the agency has not identified an arson suspect nor has it determined whether arson was the cause of the deadly fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonoma County sheriff&rsquo;s officials have pointed to Breitbart for fueling false rumors about their investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, there&rsquo;s been no suspect identified and no arrests made tied to these deadly fires, contrary to the website&rsquo;s inaccurate and irresponsible claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Breitbart&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-10-21T00:04:43.942405", "ruling_date": "2017-10-20T10:28:02", "ruling_headline": "Breitbart\u2019s False and inflammatory claim about deadly Wine Country fires", "ruling_headline_slug": "breitbarts-false-and-inflammatory-claim-about-dead", "ruling_link_text": "Sheriff's official says Breitbart fabricated story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Breitbart, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/17/ice-detainer-issued-for-suspected-wine-country-arsonist-in-sonoma-jail/\">ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail</a>, Oct. 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BuzzFeed.com, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/briannasacks/no-an-undocumented-immigrant-did-not-start-the-deadly?utm_term=.wmYPYxOwL3#.fhYVDKoOPn\">Breitbart Made Up False Story That Immigrant Started Deadly Sonoma Wildfires, Sheriff&#39;s Office Says</a>, Oct. 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ktvu/videos/10155080254167061/\">press conference</a>, Oct. 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano, <a href=\"https://local.nixle.com/alert/6216269/\">Response to misinformation about arson arrest</a>, Oct. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonoma County Sheriff&rsquo;s Sgt.
