And some say New Englanders could see higher electricity prices without an ample supply of natural gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where Richard Paglia and his company, Houston-based Spectra Energy, come in. An upgrade to gas pipelines and gas storage capacity would expand supply and lower electricity prices, says Paglia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some critics of Spectra&rsquo;s various infrastructure projects, including two men who locked themselves to the front gates of the company&rsquo;s Burrillville compressor station over the summer, oppose greater use of fossil fuels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Without that project going forward, we will really be constrained,&quot; Paglia said during an appearance on WPRI&rsquo;s Executive Suite. &quot;We already pay the highest electricity prices in the country here in New England.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The costliest electricity in the country?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought this was worth a check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research found that the average cost of electricity in New England is higher than other regions of the continental United States. But an emphasis on the words &quot;region&quot; and &quot;continental&quot; is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2015, the average price of electricity for New England&rsquo;s six states was about 18.1 cents per kilowatt hour, according to a price monitoring report issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Oct. 27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average price for electricity in the state of California, 18.2 cents, slightly exceeded New England&rsquo;s average. But California&rsquo;s averages were lower during the winter of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in August, California&rsquo;s region, which encompasses Oregon and Washington, had less expensive electricity than New England. Washington state&rsquo;s average of 9.4 cents &ndash; the lowest in the country &ndash; helped hold the average price in its Pacific coast region to 15.7 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison, the average for Rhode Island this past August was 18.7 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the region that encompasses New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, the average was 16.5 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, electricity was significantly less expensive elsewhere in the continental United States, away from the northeast and California coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in a region that the EIA refers to as &quot;Pacific Noncontiguous,&quot; which encompasses just Alaska and Hawaii, the average price of electricity was almost 27 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hawaii&rsquo;s average electricity price was about 30 cents while Alaska&rsquo;s was 21 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Spectra, Creighton A. Welch, acknowledged that the New England region&rsquo;s electricity prices are only highest in the continental United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The main message here,&quot; said Welch, &quot;is that it&rsquo;s a shame New England&rsquo;s electric costs are so high relative to nearby regions &ndash; especially when practically next door sits a vast supply of affordable, domestic natural gas &ndash; that they are limiting economic competitiveness and growth in the region. It&rsquo;s critical that we solve this energy challenge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New England had the priciest electricity in the continental United States according to a government report that compares New England to other regions of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same report shows that California&rsquo;s electricity was more expensive than electricity in four of six New England states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Hawaii and Alaska are U.S. states and electricity within both of those states was more expensive than the New England region&rsquo;s average. The average for the region that both states are grouped in was more expensive, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. For this reason, we rate it <strong>Half True</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-10T14:53:55.424270", "ruling_date": "2015-11-12T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Electricity rates here are high, but not the highest", "ruling_headline_slug": "electricity-rates-here-are-high-not-highest", "ruling_link_text": "What about Alaska and Hawaii?
