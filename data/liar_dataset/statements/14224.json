Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., triggered outrage among conservative media. Infowars, the conspiracy website of Alex Jones, accused top Democrats of instigating this sort of violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The June 14 headline basically said it all: &quot;<a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/flashback-tim-kaine-loretta-lynch-called-for-blood-death-in-streets/\">FLASHBACK: Tim Kaine, Loretta Lynch Called For Blood and Death In Streets</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential candidate, and Lynch, Barack Obama&#39;s former attorney general, were part of &quot;a stunning collection of calls to violence and murder from the intolerant, unhinged leftists in the Democrat party, mainstream media, Hollywood, and the spider web of interwoven organizations and cabals like Antifa and Black Lives Matter who have effectively transformed into domestic terrorists in Trump&rsquo;s America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding Lynch, Infowars said she used &quot;incendiary language in a bizarre one-minute video in which she seemed to call upon fellow &lsquo;progressives&rsquo; to march, bleed, and die in the streets ... in resistance to the Trump agenda.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fact-check focuses on the Lynch allegations and whether the video shows what Infowars said it does.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The video</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On Feb. 28, 2017, the Senate Democrats posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/USSenateDemocrats/videos/1245624528840072/\">video on its Facebook</a> page with the introduction, &quot;If you need to hear some words of inspiration tonight, take a moment for our friend, former Attorney General, Loretta E. Lynch.&quot; It&rsquo;s not clear when or where Lynch was speaking, but she seems to speaking in the context of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s recent inauguration. While she never mentioned Trump, the video went up a few hours before Trump would address a joint session of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>About a week before the video, the Homeland Security Department <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/02/21/qa-dhs-implementation-executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement\">implemented tough new policies on deportations</a>. The Trump administration undid <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rolls-back-protections-for-transgender-students/2017/02/22/550a83b4-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.685c54dd068d\">civil rights protections for transgender students</a>. Both ran counter to Obama era policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the full text from Lynch:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it&rsquo;s a time of concern for people who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on, and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our founding fathers. And it has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals, who have made the difference. They&rsquo;ve marched, they&rsquo;ve bled &mdash; yes, some of them have died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before; we can do this again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the face of it, Lynch didn&rsquo;t say what Infowars asserted. She didn&rsquo;t call for anyone to commit violence. The violence she described was inflicted on those who marched to defend the rights of individuals. She said they bled and they died. She didn&rsquo;t say they caused others to bleed or others to die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Infowars web post recycled virtually identical claims that ran in early March from many conservative corners, including <a href=\"https://mediamatters.org/embed/static/clips/2017/03/06/52616/fnc-ff-201736-childers\">Fox News</a>, <a href=\"http://www.billoreilly.com/video/video-of-the-day?vid=972119298418055651\">Bill O&rsquo;Reilly</a> (then a Fox News host), and <a href=\"http://www.wnd.com/2017/03/loretta-lynch-need-more-marching-blood-death-on-streets/\">WND</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fact-check from the conservative <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/15/fact-check-did-tim-kaine-and-loretta-lynch-call-for-blood-and-death-in-the-streets/\">Daily Caller</a> website also declared the Infowars article false.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Infowars said Lynch advocated &quot;violence and murder.&quot; She did not. She said that people who have marched for political change have bled and been killed. That would be the opposite of what Infowars said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-16T11:08:19.830601", "ruling_date": "2017-06-16T12:36:02", "ruling_headline": "Loretta Lynch did not call for 'violence and murder,' 'blood and death in streets'", "ruling_headline_slug": "infowars-ridiculous-claim-dems-called-violence", "ruling_link_text": "Flips the meaning of words", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Infowars, <a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/flashback-tim-kaine-loretta-lynch-called-for-blood-death-in-streets/\">FLASHBACK: Tim Kaine, Loretta Lynch Called For Blood &amp; Death In Streets</a>, June 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/USSenateDemocrats/videos/1245624528840072/\">Loretta Lynch Facebook post</a>, Feb. 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Caller, <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/15/fact-check-did-tim-kaine-and-loretta-lynch-call-for-blood-and-death-in-the-streets/\">FACT CHECK: Did Tim Kaine And Loretta Lynch Call For Blood And Death In The Streets?</a>, June 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/2017/03/06/loretta-lynch-anti-trump-protests/\">Did Loretta Lynch Call For Violent Anti-Trump Protests?</a>, March 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gateway Pundit, <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/06/flashback-loretta-lynch-calls-blood-death-streets-video/\">Flashback: Loretta Lynch Calls For &lsquo;Blood and Death&rsquo; in the Streets</a>, June 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media Matters, <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2017/03/06/right-wing-media-distort-former-attorney-general-s-words-about-protests-call-violence/215569\">Right-Wing Media Distort Former Attorney General&rsquo;s Words About Protests As A Call For Violence</a>, March 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Matt House, spokesman, Senate Democrats, June 15, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": " ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 3978, "last_name": "Infowars", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "infowars", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Infowars.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3978/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Loretta Lynch was part of &quot;a stunning collection of calls to violence and murder from the intolerant, unhinged leftists in the Democrat party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a website article", "statement_date": "2017-06-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 117, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/117/", "subject": "Civil Rights", "subject_slug": "civil-rights", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "No, Loretta Lynch did not call for 'violence and murder'"}
