In response, Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Michael Schirling sent SNL some Vermont flannel shirts Oct. 2 and responded to the show&rsquo;s creators that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We invite SNL viewers to Vermont to see all that we have to offer, including our increasingly diverse communities and wide array of tourist destinations including the African American Heritage Trail,&quot; said Schirling in <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2018/10/02/vermont-tourism-department-responds-snl-adam-driver-sketch\">the statement</a>, which the department sent to Boston.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now is a perfect time to visit or to consider a move here. The leaves are changing and so is Vermont,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to see if Schirling&#39;s statement was true, given that Vermont remains the second whitest state in the union. Is the state becoming more racially diverse? It turns out there has been a slight uptick in Vermont&#39;s non-white population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schirling said he obtained his information from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey, a research project that produces population, demographic and housing estimates, indeed has found that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse, or at least less white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">survey found </a>that Vermont was 95 percent white in 2013 and 94.2 percent white in 2017, a drop of 0.8 percent, according to a spokesperson for the American Community Survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the category of non-white races in the Census data, there are many variations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2013 to 2017, the increase in the African-American population from 1.1 percent to 1.3 percent, was not statistically significant. But the percent change in the Asian and Hispanic populations was: Asians went from 1.2 percent of the Vermont population to 1.8 percent, a 0.6 percentage point increase; Hispanics went from 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent, a 0.4 percentage point increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement that Vermont is becoming increasingly diverse needs further clarification. Schirling does not explain that the increase in Vermont&#39;s racially diverse populations is slight. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-31T15:46:44.905358", "ruling_date": "2018-10-31T15:40:16", "ruling_headline": "Vermont's leaves are changing, but is the racial makeup of its population?", "ruling_headline_slug": "vermonts-leaves-are-changing-racial-makeup-its-pop", "ruling_link_text": "A tiny bit more diverse", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Saturday Night Live <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKcUOUYzDXA\">skit on Youtube</a>,&nbsp;Sept. 29, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2018/10/02/vermont-tourism-department-responds-snl-adam-driver-sketch\">Boston.com</a>, &quot;Vermont tourism department responds to &lsquo;Saturday Night Live&rsquo; sketch that cast the state as a &lsquo;Caucasian paradise,&rsquo;&quot;&nbsp;Oct. 2, 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Census Bureau&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\"> American Community Survey</a>, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Secretary of Commerce and Community Development", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Vermont", "id": 4476, "last_name": "Schirling", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-schirling", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/schirling_crop.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "edition": "Vermont", "edition_slug": "vermont", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 65, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "Vermont Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/65/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4476/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We invite SNL viewers to Vermont to see all that we have to offer, including our increasingly diverse communities...
