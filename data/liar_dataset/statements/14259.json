He was trapped and died when workers filled the oven with six tons of canned tuna and turned it up to 270 degrees to cook and sterilize the food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angel Rodriguez, the plant operations director; Saul Florez, the safety manager; and Bumble Bee Foods all faced three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules. Bumble Bee Foods <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/08/13/bumble-bee-forced-pay-6m-worker-cooked-alive/31620881/\">settled the case in August 2015 for $6 million</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, no one chopped up Melena and put his remains in the meat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A website called TheRacketReport.com posted the <a href=\"http://theracketreport.com/massive-bumble-bee-recall-after-2-employees-admit-cooking-a-man-and-mixing-him-with-a-batch-of-tuna/\">story excerpt on April 28, 2015</a>, the same day the AP story was published. It carried the headline, &quot;Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story doesn&rsquo;t mention anyone being mixed in with the fish, despite the headline. The site&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://theracketreport.com/contact-us/about-us/\">About Us link</a> noted that &quot;the articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward to the following year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 16, 2016, Bumble Bee Foods did issue a <a href=\"http://www.bumblebee.com/bumble-bee-foods-llc-issues-voluntary-recall-on-3-production-codes-of-canned-chunk-light-tuna-due-to-possible-health-risk/\">real recall</a> for &quot;process deviations,&quot; and not for the incident related Melena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fake news site News4KTLA.com recycled the AP story about the workers being charged in Melena&rsquo;s death <a href=\"http://news4ktla.com/massive-tuna-recall/\">the next day</a>. The post also re-used the fake headline &quot;Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site attempts to look like a real media outlet, but does not give an indication it is fake, saying it covers &quot;<a href=\"http://news4ktla.com/about-us/\">southern Louisiana and the surrounding area</a>.&quot; The real KTLA TV station is <a href=\"http://ktla.com/\">based in Los Angeles</a>. The fake headline has been passed around ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-26T12:08:22.224025", "ruling_date": "2017-06-26T12:10:17", "ruling_headline": "Fake headline muddles real story of man cooked to death in tuna oven", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-headline-muddles-real-story-man-cooked-death-", "ruling_link_text": "Bogus websites added the phony details", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>BlueLineStrong.net, &quot;<a href=\"http://bluelinestrong.net/massive-bumble-bee-recall-2-employees-admit-cooking-man-mixing-batch-tuna/\">Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna</a>,&quot; April 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/10/local/la-me-ln-bumble-bee-worker-cooked-20130510\">Details emerge about how Bumble Bee worker died in pressure cooker</a>,&quot; May 10, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;Tuna company, 2 managers charged in death of worker in oven,&quot; April 28, 2015, accessed via Nexis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheRacketReport.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://theracketreport.com/massive-bumble-bee-recall-after-2-employees-admit-cooking-a-man-and-mixing-him-with-a-batch-of-tuna/\">Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna</a>,&quot; April 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/04/28/bumble-bee-foods-tuna-worker-cooked/26517161/\">Bumble Bee Foods charged after man cooked with tuna</a>,&quot; April 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/08/13/bumble-bee-forced-pay-6m-worker-cooked-alive/31620881/\">Bumble Bee forced to pay $6M for worker cooked alive</a>,&quot; Aug. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BumbleBee.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bumblebee.com/bumble-bee-foods-llc-issues-voluntary-recall-on-3-production-codes-of-canned-chunk-light-tuna-due-to-possible-health-risk/\">Bumble Bee Foods, LLC issues voluntary recall on 3 production codes of canned Chunk Light tuna due to possible health risk</a>,&quot; March 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News4KTLA.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://news4ktla.com/massive-tuna-recall/\">Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna</a>,&quot; March 17, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Massive Bumble Bee recall after 2 employees admit cooking a man and mixing him with a batch of tuna.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2017-04-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
