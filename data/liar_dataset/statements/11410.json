For August, the rate was 4.5 percent, according to the latest figures available when Saslaw made his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These monthly figures date to 1976, but you don&rsquo;t have to go back too far to find a time when the rate was lower than 4.5 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was lower than that level each month during the 149 months from May 1996 through September 2008. During that period, there were times it even was below the 3 percent threshold and actually reached a low point of 2.1 percent in October and November of 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2008, as the recession took hold, Virginia&rsquo;s jobless rate started to grow at a brisk clip and eventually hit 7.4 percent by January 2010. The rate has trended down since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 4.5 percent figure for August is the lowest the rate has been since it started to spike in 2008, Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a Sept. 18 news release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sam Sterling, Saslaw&rsquo;s campaign manager, said the senator was trying to reiterate the governor&rsquo;s point that unemployment is the lowest since 2008, but he didn&rsquo;t say that during the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He had meant to say that (Virginia) has its lowest unemployment rate since 2008,&quot; Sterling wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also should note that Virginia has seen other periods of sub-4.5 percent unemployment, including 39 months from May 1987 through July 1990 and from December 1994 through April 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saslaw said during the debate that Virginia&rsquo;s unemployment rate is the lowest in the state&rsquo;s history. Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show he&rsquo;s wrong, and the senator&rsquo;s campaign says he garbled his talking point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-12T00:16:18.579404", "ruling_date": "2015-10-12T00:14:13", "ruling_headline": "Salaw says Virginia unemployment rate is at all-time low", "ruling_headline_slug": "salaw-says-virginia-unemployment-rate-all-time-low", "ruling_link_text": "Not even close", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Senator Richard Saslaw&rsquo;s comments at Christopher Newport University debate with Sen.
