We&rsquo;re still counting votes in California, <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/11/21/californias-uncounted-ballots-outnumber-total-votes-of-34-states.html\">for instance</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing as these Harambe stories popped up immediately after the election, there&rsquo;s no way they were based on real data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, every state decides on their own requirements for write-in candidates, so not all votes for Harambe would count depending on the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/\">More than 30 states</a> require a write-in candidate to file paperwork in order to be an official candidate and at least eight states don&rsquo;t even allow write-in candidates. The remaining states have no-filing requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many of these write-in votes actually get counted? Well, in 2012, 136,040 write-in votes were counted, which is .11-percent of the total votes, according <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/\">to <em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day after the presidential election, bloggers took to social media to share stories claiming Harambe received thousands of votes in this year&rsquo;s presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claims are a hoax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of those stories were written the day after the election, and any write-in votes for Harambe wouldn&rsquo;t have been counted. Moreover, more than half of states require write-in candidates file paperwork in advance of the election, while another nine don&rsquo;t even permit write-in candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim&nbsp;Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a101f410-03bf-4c11-8bd5-6398bfe4873c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a101f410-03bf-4c11-8bd5-6398bfe4873c</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-22T13:07:16.859005", "ruling_date": "2016-11-22T15:01:18", "ruling_headline": "No, 15,000 people did not vote for Harambe in 2016", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-15000-people-did-not-vote-harambe", "ruling_link_text": "RIP Harambe votes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/\">The Washington Post</a></em>, &quot;Planning to write in Paul Ryan or Bernie Sanders?
