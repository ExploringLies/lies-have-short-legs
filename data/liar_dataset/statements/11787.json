We decided to take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What tuition cost</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The easier part of this equation to nail down is the average cost of college tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_330.10.asp?referrer=report\">U.S. Education Department</a>, average undergraduate tuition and fees -- excluding room and board -- in the 1965-66 school year was $607 per year for a four-year college (public and private) and $203 for a two-year college. (Adding room and board bumps up those figures to $1,375 and $884, respectively, but O&rsquo;Malley said &quot;tuition,&quot; so we won&rsquo;t consider room and board.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the average GM worker made</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to an <a href=\"http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/08/25/page/39/article/no-budging-in-stalemate-of-autotalks\">article</a> in the Aug. 25, 1964, edition of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, the average hourly wage in the auto industry that year was $3.01. That grew a bit after a <a href=\"http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1964/10/06/page/57/article/national-pay-pact-reached-by-g-m-uaw\">new union contract</a> was negotiated later that year, but a figure in that ballpark is about right for the time frame O&rsquo;Malley was talking about, said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry and labor group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2015/03/labor/2015-media-fact-book.pdf\">Historical wage data</a> from Ford, for instance, shows that the base wage for a &quot;major assembler&quot; was $2.91 an hour in 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dziczek noted that workers in durable-goods manufacturing averaged 44 hours per week in 1965, with time-and-a-half for the final four hours. So a $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20&nbsp;for the two-week period O&rsquo;Malley cites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you ignore taxes -- a questionable policy, but one we&rsquo;ll grant O&rsquo;Malley for the sake of argument -- then two weeks of average GM pay would have been enough to pay for one year at the typical two-year college in 1965. But it would not be enough to pay for a year at typical four-year college. That would take a little more than four weeks&rsquo; work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the O&rsquo;Malley campaign says</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The O&rsquo;Malley campaign said they took the wage number from a column by University of California-Berkeley economist Robert Reich, who also served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. In 2014, Reich wrote. &quot;Fifty&nbsp;years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker got paid $35 an hour in today&rsquo;s dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that works out to $4.66 an hour <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=35.00&amp;year1=2014&amp;year2=1965\">in 1965 dollars</a>,&nbsp;and contemporary evidence suggests that wage is about 50 percent too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, on the tuition side of the equation, the O&rsquo;Malley campaign said that one year of in-state, undergraduate tuition at <a href=\"http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/sc/archives/tuition/tuitionrateschedule1964/\">University of Iowa</a> in the 1964-65 school year cost $340, and that this was the case for other states, as well, such as New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you use the $3.10-an-hour wage -- rather than Reich&rsquo;s $4.66-an-hour wage -- then two weeks&rsquo; pay, even when untaxed, would not quite cover a year&rsquo;s in-state tuition at the University of Iowa. And since many GM workers wouldn&rsquo;t have been residents of Iowa, and thus eligible for the in-state rate at the University of Iowa, we think it&rsquo;s fairer to look at average tuition nationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Comparing 1965 to today</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s comparison doesn&rsquo;t quite hold up. However, it&rsquo;s fair to note that he has a point about&nbsp;the larger question. Namely, it was a whole lot more realistic to be able to pay for a year of tuition with just a few weeks of blue-collar income in 1965 than it is now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2012-13 school year, a year&rsquo;s tuition at the average four-year college was $14,101, and the base wage at Ford for a major assembler was $28.13 an hour. If you include overtime pay, then two 44-hour weeks at that wage (without setting aside anything for taxes) works out to about $2,700, or less than 20 percent of the one-year average tuition cost. At that rate, it would take more than 10 weeks&rsquo; work, including some overtime, to pay for a year&rsquo;s worth of tuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that the rise of college tuition costs is the bigger culprit here. In nominal dollars, auto worker wages have grown ninefold since 1965. But average four-year-college tuition is up 23 times from what it was in 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Malley said, &quot;Fifty years ago, the average GM employee could pay for a year of a son or daughter&rsquo;s college tuition on just two weeks wages.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not quite right -- it would have taken about four weeks of work at GM, not two, to pay for a year at the average four-year college in 1965, and more than that if you take account of taxes. Still, O&rsquo;Malley has a point that&nbsp;the situation in 1965 was quite a deal compared to today, when a typical auto worker would have to work for 10 weeks in order to pay for a year of tuition at the average four-year college. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>CORRECTION, Feb. 2, 2016</strong>: The calculations in our original version slightly overstated the typical weekly and biweekly wages for UAW workers. A $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20 for the two-week period Martin O&rsquo;Malley cited. The difference does not affect the final rating.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-21T17:04:28.271635", "ruling_date": "2016-01-25T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Could a GM worker afford college tuition on just two weeks' work in 1965?", "ruling_headline_slug": "could-gm-worker-afford-college-tuition-just-two-we", "ruling_link_text": "More like four weeks", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Martin O&rsquo;Malley, &quot;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@MartinOMalley/as-i-ve-traveled-across-the-country-it-s-clear-that-we-have-come-a-long-way-since-the-wall-street-7cb428d1bd6d#.5v6jqr9vl\">An American Worker&rsquo;s Bill of Rights for the 21st Century</a>,&quot; Jan. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Education, &quot;<a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_330.10.asp?referrer=report\">Table 330.10.
