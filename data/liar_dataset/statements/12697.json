Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. and George H.W. Bush all <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/no-gop-convention-george-bush-222850\">declined</a> to participate or attend the 2016 nominating convention. <em>Meet the Press</em> host Chuck Todd offered the decision of the Bush family to spurn the 2016 convention as evidence that this year&rsquo;s event will be a little different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;re not showcasing the best parts of your party,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/priebus-trump-will-never-be-stopped-if-public-gets-to-know-him-726652483893\">Todd said to Priebus</a>, adding &quot;it is unusual not to have a Bush at the convention.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Priebus responded: &quot;It didn&rsquo;t happen four years ago&quot; at the 2012 RNC in Tampa. Priebus added after some back-and-forth that that &quot;there was no President Bush&quot; at the RNC in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Claims about the pre-eminence of the Bush family in Republican politics have come up before. We previously rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/26/tweets/it-true-republicans-havent-won-presidential-race-1/\">True</a> a claim that Republicans haven&rsquo;t won an election without a Bush or Nixon since 1928.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case we wondered if Priebus was right that the Bush family eschewed the RNC in some form in 2012 and 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wasn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 2012 convention</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been nearly eight years since a Bush has held national elected office, but the family has maintained a role at the nominating convention. Since 1980, every Republican convention has seen a Bush speak &mdash; often as the vice presidential or presidential nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That includes the 2012 convention in Tampa, which saw the nomination of Mitt Romney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the convention, as this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIB0aTmm-s8\">video</a> confirms. He touted his love for his brother, criticized President Barack Obama&rsquo;s record and discussed children and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promised them &mdash; an equal opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;That starts in the classroom. It starts in our communities. It starts where you live and it starts with nominating Mitt Romney the next president of the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2000, 2004 and 2008</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Priebus also contended in his interview with Todd that there was no &quot;President Bush&quot; at the 2008 RNC in St. Paul, Minn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely correct, either. President George W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpt4aO5pCxY\">addressed convention delegates live</a> from the White House. Bush told convention delegates that he remained in Washington to oversee recovery efforts related to Hurricane Gustav.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush, however, praised GOP nominee Arizona Sen. John McCain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He is ready to lead this nation,&quot; Bush said. &quot;From the day of his commissioning John McCain was a respected Naval officer who made decisions on which the lives of others depended.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First Lady Laura Bush spoke live from the convention, which also included appearances by former President George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, video from the event shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George W. Bush, the 2004 GOP nominee, of course <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2ZGUT4W5-U\">spoke</a> at the New York City 2004 convention as well, as did <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4343655/laura-bush-speech-2004-republican-national-convention\">Laura Bush</a>. Same for <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4496491/bush-2000-convention-speech\">2000</a> in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1980, 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4535832/george-hw-bush-1996-convention-speech\">spoke</a> at the 1996 convention in San Diego, Calif., which eventually nominated former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George H.W. Bush <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=21352\">spoke</a> in Houston, Texas, for the 1992 convention, as part of his failed re-election campaign.The same goes for 1988, when he was <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?3848-2/1988-george-hw-bush-speech\">named</a> the Republican nominee for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1984, George H. W. Bush was <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?4056-1/vice-president-bush-1984-acceptance-speech\">selected</a> as the vice-presidential nominee (Ronald Reagan was nominated for president). The <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?31279-1/1980-vice-presidential-acceptance-speech\">same</a> thing happened in 1980, and Bush spoke on both occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest convention we could find without a Bush speaking was in 1976, where Gerald Ford was selected as the Republican nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recap, that&rsquo;s at least 40 years and nine conventions where a Bush had a speaking role. And members of the Bush family definitely spoke at both the 2012 and 2008 conventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Priebus said it&rsquo;s not a big deal a Bush isn&rsquo;t attending the 2016 convention, because a Bush didn&rsquo;t speak in 2012 and &quot;there was no President Bush&quot; at the 2008 convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s wrong. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. In 2008, George W. Bush addressed delegates via a live video feed, but former President George H.W. Bush and former first ladies Laura and Barbara Bush all attended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Bush has spoken at every RNC since at least 1980, we found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1cef2f85-9353-4065-99c0-3b9d7c05f74d\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1cef2f85-9353-4065-99c0-3b9d7c05f74d</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-17T10:31:33.240169", "ruling_date": "2016-07-17T16:22:47", "ruling_headline": "Priebus wrongly says no Bush attended 2012 RNC", "ruling_headline_slug": "priebus-wrongly-says-no-bush-attended-2012-rnc", "ruling_link_text": "They have the last 40 years", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/26/tweets/it-true-republicans-havent-won-presidential-race-1/\">PolitiFact</a>, &quot;Is it true Republicans haven&rsquo;t won presidential race since 1928 without a Bush or Nixon?,&quot; January 26, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Election 2012: Jeb Bush&rsquo;s R.N.C Speech,&quot; The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIB0aTmm-s8\">YouTube channel</a>, August 30, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/08/republican-national-convention-schedule-013003\">Politico</a></em>, &quot;Republican National Convention schedule,&quot; August 30, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/08/politics/rnc.schedule/\">CNN</a></em>, &quot;Speakers: 2012 Republican National Convention,&quot; August 27, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Acceptance Speech: President George W.
