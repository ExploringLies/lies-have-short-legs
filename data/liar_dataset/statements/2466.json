In that vein, Future PAC, the Democrats&rsquo; campaign committee, sent a mailer recently that accuses Julie Parrish, a Republican running in House District 37, of wanting to add a sales tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mailer says Parrish &quot;has been very vocal about where she stands&quot; and &quot;Say NO to Julie Parrish and her sales tax.&quot; It also states, &quot;Julie Parrish wants to add a sales tax to everything we need to buy including food, clothing, medicine and school supplies.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats say she posted a comment on OregonLive&rsquo;s website in February that provides the basis for the claim. We took a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn February, Parrish posted a commentary on OregonLive called &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.oregonlive.com/myoregon/2010/02/not_feeling_rich.html\">Not feeling rich</a>.&quot; In it, she complains that increasingly taxes are being shouldered by businesses and people with higher incomes. She says her household income of nearly $250,000 isn&rsquo;t &quot;rich,&quot; when she has school loans to repay and three kids to put through college. The piece was popular, with a lot of back- and-forth commentary between Parrish and others.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWill Rasmussen, the Democrat in the District 37, points to one of her posts, in which she writes the following at 5 p.m.: &quot;Instead of being arbitrary, wouldn&rsquo;t it make more sense to find ways in our state to: A. cut the budget, B. assess a sales tax, C. re-do the special interest (property tax) levies?&quot; Then she writes, &quot;Why should kids in the West Linn district be entitled to a better education than those in Southern Oregon?&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tBut anyone who reads through the entirety of her comments can see that Parrish is talking about a sales tax as part of a broader tax restructure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt 10:51 a.m., earlier that same day, she says: &quot;Taxing smokers (which I don&#39;t smoke) and expecting them to shoulder the healthcare in the state is unfair. Proposed taxes on drivers to fund other mass transit isn&#39;t right either. Taxation based on income is arbitrary. If you want to tax the wealthy, do it on spending -- a sales tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd in response to this comment at 6:34 a.m., &quot;Pssst, Julie . . . whisper this to yourself . . . sales tax . . . sales tax . . . sales tax . . .&quot; she wrote at 10:18 p.m. &quot;I will....as long as we ax all the other taxes and start from scratch! In our state, we&#39;d pass a sales tax, and keep all the other ones too - just because ;-)&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat sounds more cheeky than serious.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim by Oregon House Democrats and candidate Will Rasmussen contains some element of truth -- Parrish would consider a sales tax -- but it ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression. She wouldn&rsquo;t be the first candidate, Republican or Democrat, to complain about Oregon&rsquo;s system of taxation. And if elected to the House, she certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have the power to get a sales tax implemented.
