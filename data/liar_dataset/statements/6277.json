Here we&rsquo;ll dig into the Cayman Islands charge.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney has released his tax return for 2010 and an estimate for 2011 indicating that his income was $21.7 million in 2010 and $20.9 million last year. His <a href=\"http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000286_2011_pres.pdf\">financial disclosure</a>, which is required of all presidential candidates, shows that Romney&rsquo;s personal wealth is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million, according to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-worth-up-to-264-million-earned-up-to-68000-per-speech-before-campaign-start/2011/08/12/gIQAj1fYBJ_story.html\">the Washington Post</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNews organizations have analyzed how Romney has invested his money, gleaned the greatest tax benefits and maximized profits at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Cayman Islands is mentioned in several of the reports:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t* Romney utilized shell companies in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda to attract foreign investors to Bain, according to 2007 documents analyzed by the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-na-mittoffshore17dec17,0,3457481.story\"><em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Times </em>identified one such fund as BCIP Associates III Cayman. It&rsquo;s listed on Romney&rsquo;s 2007 financial disclosure as having paid him more than $1 million the previous year in dividends, interest and capital gains.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t* Early in 2012, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/romney-parks-millions-offshore-tax-haven/story?id=15378566#.UASGxZFxGZZ\">ABC News reported</a> that Romney &quot;has as much as $8 million invested in at least 12 funds listed on a Cayman Islands registry. Another investment, which Romney reports as being worth between $5 million and $25 million, shows up on securities records as having been domiciled in the Caymans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat fund, called BCIP Trust Associates III, is part of his individual retirement account and provided between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 in income, the disclosure shows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP in New York, told PolitiFact that tax-exempt entities, including IRA accounts, sometimes invest through Cayman Islands corporations to reduce their U.S. taxes. &quot;Congress did not deliberately allow tax-exempts to reduce their U.S. taxes by investing through Cayman Islands corporations,&quot; Miller said. &quot;However, the practice is widespread and the IRS has approved of it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiller agreed that it&rsquo;s accurate to call the Cayman Islands a tax haven.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That phrase usually refers to whether the jurisdiction imposes taxes and the Cayman Islands doesn&rsquo;t,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther, more nuanced advantages exist for high net-worth individuals who put their money in foreign corporations. For example, a high net-worth individual can&rsquo;t deduct the management fee paid to a fund manager, but a foreign corporation can.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are other advantages for U.S. taxpayers who invest through foreign corporations. They&rsquo;re relatively subtle, but the advantages increase as the tax rates increase,&quot; Miller said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, in a transcript of a conference call hosted by the Romney campaign in January 2012, the trustee for the Romney family&rsquo;s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray -- acknowledged the existence of the Cayman investments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;These are investments in third-party entities,&quot; Malt said, likening them to stock in Toyota.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe continued: &quot;Each of these investments is in a blind trust. &hellip; This means the decision to make the investment was made by me, not by Gov. Romney. &hellip; I should say I, in turn, have no control over where these funds are formed. &hellip; When we make an investment in a Cayman fund, we&#39;re presented with investment documents, the sponsor has already chosen where the fund is to be organized, and to be perfectly clear, the blind trusts are a tiny part of the investor base of these funds.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe went on to emphasize that each of the Cayman funds files a U.S. tax return, which reports the blind trust&#39;s share of the fund income. &quot;Every dime of that, in turn, is reported on Gov. Romney&#39;s tax returns,&quot; Malt said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked the Romney campaign for a response to the Obama ad, a spokesman emphasized these same points -- that Romney has paid all taxes he owed, that investment decisions were made by the trustee and the trustee does not decide where the funds are &quot;domiciled.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama&rsquo;s ad says Romney had millions of dollars in the tax-friendly Cayman Islands.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s trustee acknowledged investing Romney&rsquo;s money in funds located there, and several are listed on his financial disclosures. Those forms indicate the value of those investments is in the millions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s no evidence of anything illegal or improper, but it&#39;s clear that Romney had millions in the Caymans.
