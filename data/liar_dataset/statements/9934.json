Lower taxes. More freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the mantra of the Georgia Libertarian Party, which, this year, is fielding candidates for a handful of state offices, including governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cherokee County, attorney and Libertarian Jeff Amason is running as a write-in candidate for the District 21 House seat. That seat is currently held by Scot Turner, a one-term Republican from Holly Springs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amason recently appeared on the Monica Perez Show on WSB radio to discuss his candidacy and priorities, including reining in state spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The state budget has increased almost $800 million a year in each of the last two years. You can only imagine what it might be in five years,&quot; Amason said. &quot;We need to be funding essential programs. We don&rsquo;t need to be funding every program out there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the economy making a slow but steady recovery, we decided to fact check Amason&rsquo;s budget claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted him, and he sent us budget figures for the state fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014, as well as for the current fiscal year, which started July 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That data showed that the total state budget grew from $18.5 billion in 2012 to $19.3 billion in Fiscal 2013 and to $20.2 billion in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a jump of $800 million between 2012 to 2013 and a $900 million increase between 2013 to 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We confirmed the accuracy of Amason&rsquo;s numbers using budget documents available at the Governor&rsquo;s Office of Planning and Budget website. (We didn&rsquo;t compare the 2014 and 2015 budgets because the General Assembly will amend the 2015 spending plan in the legislative session that starts in January.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helping to drive up the recent state budgets were increases in enrollment in public schools, Medicaid and the state&rsquo;s health insurance program for children, as well as pension costs, according to state documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current spending levels are 26.7 percent above 2005 levels, not adjusted for inflation, an OPB report shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, Amason said the state budget increased nearly $800 million a year in each of the last two years. He was very close, if not conservative in his assessment..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-19T11:16:37.936101", "ruling_date": "2014-09-22T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Libertarian on mark with state budget claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "libertarian-mark-state-budget-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Budget rises", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Amason <a href=\"http://themonicaperezshow.\">interview</a> on The Monica Perez Show</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Website of the Governor&rsquo;s Office of Planning and <a href=\"http://opb.georgia.gov/governors-budget-reports\">Budget&nbsp; </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jeff Amason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff Amason <a href=\"http://www.AmasonforLiberty.org\">website </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budget <a href=\"http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/news/documents/2014/09/18/Budget_Overview.pdf\">slideshow </a>from the Governor&rsquo;s Office of Planning and Budget.
