Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group declared that as governor, Thompson &quot;pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStrong words and a strong statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement contains two parts. We&rsquo;ll address them one at a time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Abortion providers facing prison</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn its blog post, EMILY&rsquo;s List cited a 1998 Wisconsin law signed by Thompson that banned most partial-birth abortions. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/lb/98lb6.pdf\">The law </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/lb/98lb6.pdf\">defined</a> the procedure, performed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, as one &quot;in which a person partially vaginally delivers a living child, causes the death of the partially delivered child with the intent to kill the child and then completes the delivery of the child.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the law, a partial-birth abortion could be performed to save the life of a woman. But anyone who illegally performed a partial-birth abortion could be convicted of a Class A felony, punishable by life in prison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat procedure, long controversial, is rarely used -- a point even pro-choice advocates made when fighting the ban.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time, Thompson was quoted as <a href=\"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69451351.html\">saying</a>: &quot;This issue has captured our hearts, for the people of Wisconsin will not stand for a procedure so heartless to occur in our state. This is a matter of humanity. Banning partial birth abortions is simply the right thing to do.&#39;&#39;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA federal appeals court <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/29345399.html\">struck </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/29345399.html\">down</a> the Wisconsin law as unconstitutional in 2001. That court cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a similar Nebraska law, which the high court said put an &quot;undue burden upon a woman&#39;s right to make an abortion decision.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat left Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_BPBA.pdf\">among 14 </a><a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_BPBA.pdf\">states</a> whose partial-birth ban laws have been blocked by courts and are not in effect, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe institute doesn&rsquo;t have statistics on partial-birth abortions, per se, but its <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html\">latest national </a><a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html\">figures</a> show that 1.5 percent of abortions in 2006 were done during the late second trimester or the third trimester of pregnancy. In any case, partial-birth abortions make up only a portion of the 1.5 percent of all abortions that are performed later in a pregnancy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, although partial-birth abortions were rarely done, Thompson did --as EMILY&rsquo;s List claimed -- support a law that subjected partial-birth abortion providers to possible life imprisonment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Women forced to leave state</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second claim made by EMILY&rsquo;s List was &quot;women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group cited news <a href=\"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69452895.html\">articles</a> about abortion providers around Wisconsin canceling abortion appointments after a federal judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the 1998 partial-birth ban law from going into effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69452851.html\">articles</a> quoted providers as saying that women who had scheduled abortions were forced to reschedule them or to get the procedure done out of state. The <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel<a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=proaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wi4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5326%2C5290626\"> </a></em><a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=proaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wi4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5326%2C5290626\">reported</a> at the time that abortion providers throughout Wisconsin put all abortion procedures on hold for a few days as they waited for legal questions about the law to be sorted out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEMILY&rsquo;s List did not provide us evidence to show that any women left Wisconsin &quot;to receive attention for life-threatening issues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Jess McIntosh, said in an email: &quot;The abortion providers who stopped working told dozens of prospective patients who needed to be seen immediately that they had to travel. Assuming not a single one did that and went on to have the procedure just isn&#39;t plausible.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also not likely, however, that all or even most females who were seeking an abortion at the time faced a life-threatening situation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked about the EMILY&rsquo;s statement, Thompson campaign spokesman Darrin Schmitz said: &quot;Gov. Thompson is proud of his pro-life record and defense of the unborn.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn support of Baldwin&rsquo;s Senate bid, EMILY&rsquo;s List said Thompson had &quot;pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA partial-birth abortion ban that Thompson signed into law as Wisconsin&rsquo;s governor did contain the life imprisonment provision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law also caused many abortion providers, at least for a few days, to stop performing abortions. That means it was possible some Wisconsin women had to leave the state in order to get an abortion. But there is no proof, as EMILY&rsquo;s List claimed, that women were forced to leave the state &quot;to receive attention for life-threatening issues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the EMILY&rsquo;s List statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-30T15:58:44.916255", "ruling_date": "2011-10-03T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "EMILY's List says GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Tommy Thompson pushed law that exposed partial-birth abortion providers to life in prison", "ruling_headline_slug": "emilys-list-says-gop-us-senate-hopeful-tommy-thomp", "ruling_link_text": "First part relates to partial-birth abortion ban, second involves more speculation than strong evidence", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tEMILY&rsquo;s List, <a href=\"http://emilyslist.org/blog/tommy_thompson_jumps_into_wisconsin_senate/\">&quot;As Tommy Thompson jumps into Wisconsin Senate race, EMILY&rsquo;s List asks: Who&rsquo;s the most conservative of them all?,&quot;</a> Sept. 19, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, EMILY&rsquo;s List spokeswoman Jess McIntosh, Sept. 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Tommy Thompson campaign spokesman Darrin Schmitz, Sept. 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Pro-Life Wisconsin Director of Legislation <a href=\"http://www.prolifewisconsin.org/staff.asp\">Matt Sande</a>, Sept. 23 and 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin spokesman Jennifer Lewis, Sept. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/lb/98lb6.pdf\">&quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s partial-birth abortion law,&quot;</a> June 1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCapital Times, <a href=\"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69451351.html\">&quot;Gov signs partial abortion law,&quot;</a> April 29, 1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/opinion/29345399.html\">&quot;State law not needed,&quot;</a> April 28, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=proaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wi4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5326%2C5290626\">&quot;State abortions on hold,&quot;</a> May 15, 1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin State Journal, <a href=\"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69452895.html\">&quot;Patients &lsquo;absolutely stunned&rsquo; ruling means women who want an abortion must wait or travel,&quot;</a> May 15, 1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCapital Times, <a href=\"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69452851.html\">&quot;Docs fear felony charges, halt abortions statewide,&quot;</a> May 14, 1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00193433&amp;cycle=2012\">EMILY&rsquo;s List spending by cycle</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000113&amp;cycle=2012\">EMILY&rsquo;s List listing</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00473918&amp;cycle=2010\">Women Vote!
