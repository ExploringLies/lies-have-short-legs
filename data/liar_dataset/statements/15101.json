The voluntary program would train teachers under the direction of local law enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One of the things that we are doing in Florida is we have instituted, as President Trump has suggested, the most robust first-of-its-kind marshal program,&quot; Corcoran said Feb. 27 on Fox News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corcoran may have spoken too soon, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2018/07026\">amended</a>&nbsp;the House proposal on March 5 and removed the ability for schools to arm teachers.&nbsp;Instead, school official&nbsp;such as custodians, principals, librarians and counselors would be eligible for training to carry guns. The bill is now moving back to the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, at the time of Corcoran&#39;s claim, the House and Senate were considering plans that would include teachers. So, we wondered whether Florida&rsquo;s proposal was really a &quot;first of its kind&quot; like Corcoran said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Breaking down Florida&rsquo;s marshal program</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of Corcoran&#39;s claim, the <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?PublicationType=Committees&amp;CommitteeId=2892&amp;Session=2018&amp;DocumentType=Proposed%20Committee%20Bills%20(PCBs)&amp;FileName=PCB%20APC%2018-06.pdf\">House</a> and <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2018/07026\">Senate</a>&nbsp;proposed school safety packages that established a &quot;marshal program,&quot; which would provide training to teachers so they can be armed on school campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program would&nbsp;be optional, and school districts and&nbsp;law enforcement would have to agree to adopt the program.&nbsp;A school employee, who voluntarily enters the program, must get a mental health screening and receive 132 hours of training for firearms safety, firearm precision and discretionary shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corcoran&nbsp;spokesman&nbsp;Fred Piccolo said the one-of-a-kind aspect is the comprehensive nature of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think the key word he used is &lsquo;robust,&rsquo; &quot; Piccolo said. &quot;At 132 hours of required tactical training we have been unable to find a more rigorous system in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Texas passed similar law in 2013</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/blog/2018/02/27/carrying-firearms-in-k-12-schools-a-policy-snapshot.aspx\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, at least five states &mdash; Georgia, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas &mdash; passed legislation allowing school employees to carry firearms at K-12 schools in the aftermath of Sandy Hook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those states, the closest plan to Florida&rsquo;s proposal is in Texas, which has had its own marshal program since 2013. Out of the other four states, Texas requires the most training. <a href=\"http://sdlegislature.gov/Legislative_Session/Bills/Bill.aspx?File=HB1087ENR.htm&amp;Session=2013&amp;Version=Enrolled&amp;Bill=1087\">South Dakota also has a similar program</a>, just with a different name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Texas, districts that choose to enter the program select a volunteer &mdash; a teacher, a coach, an administrator with the right to carry guns on school campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/24/armed-teachers-texas-trump-362397\">aren&rsquo;t solid numbers</a> on the size of the program, since the identities of marshals are anonymous, but Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/facing-criticism-trump-turns-abbott-tout-texas-school-marshals/Se9I9HfWNiHptcBEsXS3bL/\">told Trump</a> that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack. The <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/02/25/mustplace-armed-marshals-every-school-campus-texas\"><em>Dallas Morning News</em> reported</a> that there has not been any reports of incidents involving marshals at schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sent the two pieces of legislation to researchers at the National Conference of State Legislatures to see if there were any major differences between the two programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In my assessment, the programs are not all that different,&quot; said Jennifer Palmer, a research analyst, National Conference of State Legislatures. &quot;Both programs are designed to provide additional training for school employees for emergencies including active shooter situations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, there some minor differences that Palmer pointed out, including the amount of training each program requires and where the firearm must be kept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Storage of weapon:</strong> Florida marshals can carry firearms concealed in holsters approved by the sheriff. If a marshal in Texas is in &quot;regular, direct contact&quot; with students, their firearm must be stored and locked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Training:</strong> Texas marshals are required to undergo 80 hours of training, whereas the Florida program would require 132 hours of training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Number of marshals allowed:</strong> In Texas, each school can appoint one marshal per 400 students, whereas Florida&rsquo;s House bill would allow school districts to recommend &quot;school faculty and staff members&quot; with no maximum listed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Authority to act: </strong>Texas marshals are authorized to make arrests, however only &quot;as necessary to prevent or abate the commission of an offense that threatens serious bodily injury or death.&quot; Florida marshals are only able to exercise authority with the &quot;limited purpose of responding to an active assailant incident.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Other similar legislation?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another similar proposal to Florida&rsquo;s marshal program is in South Dakota where schools have the option to allow individuals to carry guns in school under the <a href=\"http://sdlegislature.gov/Legislative_Session/Bills/Bill.aspx?File=HB1087ENR.htm&amp;Session=2013&amp;Version=Enrolled&amp;Bill=1087\">sentinel programs</a> that was established in 2013. State law requires that sentinels be trained for at least 80 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida marshal program closely resembles a sheriff-initiated program in Polk County, Fla. According to the <a href=\"http://www.theledger.com/news/20180222/school-safety-awareness-brings-armed-staff-question-back-in-polk\"><em>Lakeland Ledger</em>,</a> Southeastern University, a private school in Florida, implemented a sentinel program that allows teachers to serve as trained special deputies authorized to carry weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Corcoran said the marshal program to arm teachers is the &quot;first of its kind.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas established a very similar program in 2013. South Dakota also has a similar program, just under a different name. Both Texas&rsquo; law and Florida&rsquo;s house proposal have the same goal, which is to provide training to teachers and school employees to carry guns on school campuses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
