And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve rated two claims from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/02/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-solar-company-/\">Pants on Fire</a>) and paying for jobs in Finland (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/\">False</a>). &nbsp;In this fact-check, we&rsquo;re examining if those tax credits included &quot;tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(We&#39;ve also checked many other exaggerations<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/subjects/stimulus/\"> about the stimulus</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad said its source for the China claim was a <em>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</em> article, &quot;Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights made largely overseas.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Traffic lights in China</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs the ad&rsquo;s narrator talks about China, the words, &quot;Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights &hellip;&quot; &quot;in China &hellip;&quot; appear on the screen, over an image of a traffic light that&rsquo;s slowly layered with the deep red and yellow of the Chinese flag.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad was clearly suggesting U.S.-funded lights on Chinese streets. It wasn&rsquo;t until we pulled up the <em>Tribune-Review</em> article we realized the ad&rsquo;s claim could be heard another way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOh! Lights built in China, for American streets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut even that clarification didn&rsquo;t get us to the complete story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em><a href=\"http://triblive.com/home/\">Tribune-Review</a></em> article, by <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lou-kilzer/7/5b8/648\">Lou Kilzer,</a> a reporter who has won Pulitzer prizes for <a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1990\">investigative reporting</a> and public service, digs into grant money &mdash; not tax credits, as the ad claimed &mdash; awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It says that tens of millions of stimulus dollars went to replace streetlights and traffic lights across the country with energy-efficient versions &mdash; &quot;made mostly in Asia.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reason? Certain components of those energy-efficient street and traffic lights, such as light-emitting diodes or LEDs, weren&rsquo;t available in large enough quantities from U.S. manufacturers back in 2010, so the <a href=\"http://www1.eere.energy.gov/recovery/pdfs/buy_american_waivers.pdf\">Energy Department issued a waiver</a> to the Recovery Act&rsquo;s &quot;Buy America&quot; provision for those parts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe department found such components were manufactured &quot;almost exclusively in China and Mexico.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was February 2010. The Energy Department <a href=\"about:blank\">withdrew its waiver</a> eight months later after at least one manufacturer of LED lights moved some work from Mexico back to the United States. Suddenly, enough parts would be available to satisfy stimulus grant recipients. They&rsquo;re now once again subject to &quot;Buy America&quot; provisions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, back to those eight months &mdash; could tens of millions of dollars have gone toward building street lights in China?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not clear. But it&rsquo;s also not proven by the <em>Tribune-Review</em> story, which talks not just about China, but also about Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. (We suspect the admakers chose China to make it sound more outrageous.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the companies building the streetlights told the <em>Tribune-Review</em> that &quot;their products would be better labeled &lsquo;assembled in America&rsquo; than &lsquo;made in America.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne example: Leotek Electronics USA, based in California. It&rsquo;s a subsidiary of Taiwanese companies, Kilzer reported. Leotek bought some of its LEDs from Philips Lumileds, an American subsidiary of a Dutch company. More than half of Philips&rsquo; manufacturing production capacity is based in China. Note the complex path to a finished streetlight, as described by Kilzer:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Philips produced the first component, semiconductor wafers, at its San Jose, Calif., plant.<br />\r\n\t&bull; It shipped the wafers to Singapore, where they were cut into chips and sent to Malaysia.<br />\r\n\t&bull; Malaysian workers molded them into LED modules.<br />\r\n\t&bull; Some of those LED packages went to Leotek in Taiwan to be put on circuit boards.<br />\r\n\t&bull; Boards and streetlight housings got shipped to Leotek&rsquo;s plant in Milpitas, Calif., where workers combined them with &lsquo;U.S.- and non-U.S.-made components&rsquo; for assembly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKilzer said Leotek won more than a dozen stimulus street and traffic projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found one such project, for the <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/RecipientReportedData/Pages/RecipientProjectSummary.aspx?AwardIDSUR=24211&amp;PopId=59866\">City of Palo Alto</a>, which paid $355,281 from a stimulus grant to Leotek for LED streetlight fixtures. About 60 percent of its total grant of nearly $640,000 went toward fixtures, including others from GE Lighting and Genlyte Thomas Group. But more than 40 percent was spent on software and consulting services and installation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did some stimulus money end up spent on parts made in China? Yes, according to Kilzer&rsquo;s reporting and a now-withdrawn Energy Department waiver indicating the parts were available there when they weren&rsquo;t widely manufactured in the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid it add up to tens of millions of dollars? Kilzer&rsquo;s piece talks about that amount of money being spent &quot;to replace streetlights and traffic lights nationwide,&quot; and says the new, efficient lights would be made &quot;mostly in Asia&quot; &mdash; not just China.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s not clear whether Kilzer&rsquo;s number also includes installation, consulting services and other non-fixture expenses &mdash; the kind of stuff that consumed 40 percent of Palo Alto&rsquo;s grant. (We asked him, but didn&rsquo;t hear back.) It is clear that the &quot;tens of millions&quot; reflects spending for American-assembled lights that included varying amounts of foreign-made components. But it&#39;s an exaggeration to say they were built in China.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone of this evidence supports the strong suggestion in the ad that Americans paid for streetlights on roads in China, or even that they paid to build streetlights in China. Instead, for less than a year, stimulus funds could be used to buy products that used components produced in other countries, including China.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe watched this ad and imagined Chinese street corners with shiny new American-funded traffic lights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reality is nearly the opposite: American cities, counties and states bought and installed new energy-efficient street and traffic lights with stimulus grants. Many of those lights contained foreign components, including some from China, but it&rsquo;s simply not clear how much stimulus money went toward those parts during the eight months it was allowed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad&rsquo;s claim has a tiny sliver of truth, but it pairs words and images to create an altogether different impression. We&rsquo;ll have to put the brakes on this traffic light claim, and rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-03T15:27:16.034718", "ruling_date": "2012-05-03T18:22:35", "ruling_headline": "Ad says stimulus tax credits funded traffic lights in China", "ruling_headline_slug": "ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c", "ruling_link_text": "American streetlights, some Chinese parts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmericans for Prosperity, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lUQdP6y0ArM\">AFP Wasteful Spending Ad</a>,&quot;
