It&rsquo;s been a big negative, President Donald Trump told Fox News&rsquo; Sean Hannity during an interview in Las Vegas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, who has negotiated with both Canada and Mexico to replace the current agreement, told Hannity, &quot;NAFTA was a disaster. We lost thousands of plants. We lost millions of jobs. NAFTA was a disaster.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We take up Trump&rsquo;s statement about job losses in a separate fact-check. Here, we&rsquo;ll look at the question of plants that have been lost post-NAFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States saw a loss of more than 80,000 manufacturing establishments from 1994 through 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from a Census Bureau series, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_estab.html\">Business Dynamics Statistics</a>, tallied 357,330 manufacturing establishments in 1994 and 274,756 in 2014, the last year for which data is available.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granted, it&rsquo;s unlikely that every shuttered manufacturing plant owes its closure to NAFTA. Among other things, advancements in technology have revolutionized manufacturing in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even if a small fraction of the closures stem at least in part from NAFTA, then Trump&rsquo;s use of &nbsp;&quot;thousands&quot; is valid.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that since NAFTA, &quot;we lost thousands of plants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s actually an understatement. The United States lost 80,000 plants since then. Not all can be blamed on NAFTA, but even if only a fraction of them can be, Trump has a point. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Editor&#39;s note, Sept. 24, 2018:&nbsp;</strong><em>PolitiFact has joined an effort with other North American fact-checkers to examine statements about trade and tariffs.
