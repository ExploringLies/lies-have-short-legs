As originally noted, however, oil production in Texas still topped out in 1972. The corrected production figures don't affect our rating of Commissioner Patterson's statement.</p>\r\n<p>Jerry Patterson,  the state land commissioner seeking a third term this November, refers to the the state&rsquo;s oil-soaked  history in a recent column extolling renewable energy. In his article,  published Tuesday in the Austin American-Statesman, Patterson writes:  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it&rsquo;s no  secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Even  though oil production has been declining, state revenue from oil and  gas is the tops?</p>\r\n<p>When we sought background, the General Land  Office shared a chart showing state oil and gas income reached a  historical high of $495 million in 1982 that wasn't exceeded until 2008,  when it hit $533 million.</p>\r\n<p>The state's  oil-and-gas-related proceeds dropped to $381 million in 2009, the land  office says. Counting revenue during the first seven months of this  fiscal year, we calculate it will reach $279 million by the end of the  2010 fiscal year Aug. 31.</p>\r\n<p>Total state take during  Patterson's seven-plus years as commissioner: $2.7 billion.</p>\r\n<p>And  when did oil production peak?</p>\r\n<p>According to the Texas  Railroad Commission, which tracks in-state oil production, the peak year  for crude oil production was 1972 when more than 167,000 wells produced  nearly 1.3 billion barrels. As of 2007, production had ebbed to about  336 million barrels. In 2008, production increased for the first time since  1991 to more than 346 million barrels, before falling in 2009, according to  the commission.</p>\r\n<p>R.J. DeSilva, spokesperson for the  State Comptroller's office, offered this analysis for the surge in state  income from oil and gas surged well after oil production peaked: \"Oil  and natural gas production are taxed on the value of oil and natural gas  that&rsquo;s produced. Oil and natural gas prices were higher in the early  &lsquo;80s than in the &lsquo;70s (and reached all time highs in 2008).\"</p>\r\n<p>So  how does Patterson&rsquo;s statement shake out?</p>\r\n<p>He gets  the peak-production timing right; it was the '70s.</p>\r\n<p>But  he's off in saying state government is making more than ever from oil  and gas \"right now.\" That was true for the fiscal year that ended Aug.  31, 2008, but in 2009 state oil and gas revenue fell 29 percent from the  year before and it's on pace to register another decline this fiscal  year.</p>\r\n<p>We rate Patterson's statement as  Mostly True.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-29T18:16:04.856997", "ruling_date": "2010-05-02T19:01:28", "ruling_headline": "Land commissioner says state getting most ever in oil and gas proceeds though oil production topped out in 1970s", "ruling_headline_slug": "land-commissioner-says-state-getting-most-ever-oil", "ruling_link_text": "Key factor: prices drive returns", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview,  Jerry Patterson, Texas land commissioner, April 27, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Jerry  Patterson, Texas land commissioner, column published in Austin  American-Statesman, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/opinion/patterson-future-is-in-green-energy-626480.html\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Patterson:   Future is in green energy,&rdquo;</a> April 27, 2010 (accessed April 27,  2010)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04272010_landofficeresponses.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail   excerpts</a>, Jim Suydam, press secretary, Texas General Land Office,  responses to W.
