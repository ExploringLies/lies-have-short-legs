I said, &lsquo;Oh, finally, I can attack,&rsquo; &quot; the New York businessman said to laughter in Oskaloosa. &quot;Finally, finally.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump -- second to Walker among Republican presidential contenders in an <a href=\"http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/e6c48f94-1380-45b6-80e4-dbaf5f5f78ad.pdf\">Iowa poll</a> earlier in the week -- criticized him on several fronts. Then he made a claim about the fortunes of Wisconsin&rsquo;s finances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s doing terribly. First of all, it&rsquo;s in turmoil,&quot; Trump said. &quot;The roads are a disaster because they don&rsquo;t have any money to rebuild them. They&rsquo;re borrowing money like crazy. They projected a $1 billion surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on that last part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Trump right that a projected $1 billion surplus became a $2.2 billion deficit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is partly on the money, but he&rsquo;s mixing apples and oranges, and his use of the word deficit is problematic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By law, Wisconsin&rsquo;s two-year budgets must be balanced -- revenue equalling expenditures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can never run an actual budget deficit by borrowing money that piles up as debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, the state does various projections of what revenues and expenditures will be for the upcoming two-year budget cycle. Those projections can show a surplus or a deficit -- although &quot;deficit&quot; is more accurately termed a projected shortfall, since there is no actual red ink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our requests for evidence to back his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the two figures he cited were projections that received plenty of attention when they were made. And we have dealt with them repeatedly in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The two figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2014, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected Wisconsin would see a surplus of <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Revenue-Estimates/Documents/2014_01_16_Revenue%20estimates.pdf\">about $1 billion</a> by June 30, 2015 -- the end of the 2013-&rsquo;15 budget cycle. At the time, revenues were coming in higher than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker and the GOP-run Legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in 2014, making good on a Walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers, but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes, such as <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/of-a-surplus-of-nearly-1-billion-not-a-dime-is-going-to-the-rainy-day-fund\">boosting</a> the state&rsquo;s rainy day fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way, however, tax collections grew at a slower pace than had been projected. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By November 2014, there was a reversal of fortune: Walker&rsquo;s own Department of Administration projected a <a href=\"http://doa.wi.gov/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/November20Report.pdf\">$2.2 billion</a> shortfall for 2015-&rsquo;17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, that figure was not an actual deficit. Indeed, even as a projected shortfall it was overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because the standard for projections made in the months leading up to the next budget cycle is to include all the funding requests made by state agencies -- even though, in reality, those requests always get trimmed. That serves to temporarily inflate the actual picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, the 2015-&rsquo;17 budget approved by the Legislature and signed by Walker in July 2015 was balanced -- just as every other Wisconsin state budget is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixing apples and oranges, Trump said that under Walker, Wisconsin &quot;projected a $1 billion (budget) surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was in early 2014 a projection of a $1 billion surplus heading into the 2015-&rsquo;17 budget period. Late in 2014, there was a projection of a $2.2 billion shortfall -- the difference between expected revenues and the amount of money being requested by state agencies. But the shortfall was never a deficit -- and some of the surplus was consciously spent by Republicans, as tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only an element of truth and&nbsp;ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-27T16:46:01.150238", "ruling_date": "2015-07-28T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says that under Scott Walker, Wisconsin budget went from projected surplus to a deficit", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-says-under-scott-walker-wisconsin-bud", "ruling_link_text": "Apples and oranges; and no actual deficit", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-EC74Ns6UI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> of Donald Trump speech (comments on Walker start at 36:30), July 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Gov.
