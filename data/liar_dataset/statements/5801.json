The changes do not affect our rating.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs Austin&rsquo;s candidates for mayor took part in a debate April 16, 2012, Clay Dafoe urged less spending on trains and more money for bus service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Basically, what we&rsquo;re having is people riding a bus, subsidizing this expensive, romanticized train that really doesn&rsquo;t qualify or fit the needs of Austin,&quot; said Dafoe, a tax preparer, in the debate televised by Austin&rsquo;s KXAN-TV, Channel 36.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Austin is again considering a <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/traffic/entries/2012/04/20/urban_rail_details_likely_to_e.html?cxntfid=blogs_shortcuts\">plan for electric-powered &quot;urban rail,&quot;</a> its current system is diesel-powered commuter trains, in operation since 2010. Capital Metro, Austin&rsquo;s transit agency, <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/metrorail/schedules.asp\">runs</a> MetroRail between Leander and downtown Austin roughly 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. weekdays and, with hours added in March, until midnight Friday and 4 p.m. to midnight Saturday. A one-way fare to ride the whole distance is $2.75.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMetroBus is Capital Metro&rsquo;s catch-all term for its 65 regularly scheduled bus routes criss-crossing Austin and in some cases extending out to suburbs like Leander, Manor and the Wells Branch area. A day pass, entitling a rider to board all but the agency&rsquo;s 900 series express bus, costs $2; an express bus day pass costs $5.50.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom data that Cap Metro spokeswoman Erica McKewen emailed to us, including a link to the agency&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/docs/financial/CapMetro-Budget-FY2012.pdf\">2012 budget</a>, it&rsquo;s clear MetroBus earns more than MetroRail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor 2012, Cap Metro predicted MetroRail will provide 400,000 rides and earn $909,939, while MetroBus will provide 25.4 million rides and earn $8.8 million in fares.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut expenses are considerably higher than revenue from fares. MetroRail&rsquo;s 2012 operating costs were estimated at $11.8 million for 2012, and MetroBus expenses at $106.6 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo neither system is covering its own expenses -- nor is either intended to. Most of Cap Metro&rsquo;s budget comes from a sales tax on purchases made in the agency&rsquo;s service area, McKewen said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chart on Cap Metro&rsquo;s website <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/InsideMetro/finance-budget.asp\">shows</a> the agency expects 80.3 percent of its 2012 revenues will come from that 1 percent tax, which its board raised from 0.75 percent in 1995.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThus, the tax is expected to bring in $153.2 million (out of $191 million total revenues) for 2012. Cap Metro&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/docs/financial/CapMetro-Annual-FY2011.pdf\">2011 year-end financial report</a> says that in 2011, sales tax revenues were $151.2 million (80 percent of total $189.3 million), compared with $141.9 million (74 percent of total $191.9 million) in 2010, the year MetroRail began running.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcKewen said that Cap Metro&rsquo;s April 23, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/local/cap-metro-oks-520-million-in-contracts-outsourcing-2321526.html\">deal to outsource bus operations</a> is not expected to result in the system becoming profitable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAre bus riders &quot;subsidizing&quot; the trains, in any sense?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot by the usual definition of &quot;subsidy,&quot; which is a grant of money. McKewen said no block of funds is transferred from the bus services to the train services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf we use a more colloquial sense of &quot;subsidize,&quot; we might say, for example, that if one unit of a company turns a profit while another loses money, the first unit is &quot;paying&quot; to keep the other afloat. That&rsquo;s not the case here: Neither the rail nor buses turn a profit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCap Metro&rsquo;s buses pull more of their weight, so to speak, than its trains. But neither system turns a profit, and besides, most of the agency&rsquo;s budget comes from sales tax, not tickets to ride.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo if anybody&rsquo;s &quot;subsidizing&quot; the trains, it&rsquo;s Austin-area shoppers, though that group likely overlaps with bus riders. We rate Dafoe&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-25T15:18:25.550635", "ruling_date": "2012-04-25T14:17:34", "ruling_headline": "UPDATED: Clay Dafoe says Austin bus riders subsidize commuter rail", "ruling_headline_slug": "clay-dafoe-says-austin-bus-riders-subsidize-commut", "ruling_link_text": "Austin-area shoppers pay most of cost", "ruling_state": "Texas", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAustin <a href=\"http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/local/austin/candidates-agressive-in-mayoral-debate\">mayoral candidates&rsquo; debate</a>, KXAN-TV, video, April 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone and email interviews with Clay Dafoe, Austin mayoral candidate, April 20-24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone and email interviews with Erica McKewen, communications specialist for Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, April 19-24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> blog post, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/traffic/entries/2012/04/20/urban_rail_details_likely_to_e.html\">&quot;Urban rail details likely to emerge in late May,&quot;</a> April 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCapital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Capmetro.org <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/metrorail/schedules.asp\">train schedules</a>, accessed April 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCapital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/docs/financial/CapMetro-Budget-FY2012.pdf\">&quot;Fiscal Year 2012 Approved Budget,&quot;</a> accessed April 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCapital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/InsideMetro/finance-budget.asp\">&quot;2012 Budget Basics,&quot;</a> accessed April 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCapital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/docs/financial/CapMetro-Annual-FY2011.pdf\">2011 &quot;Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,&quot;</a> March 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> news story, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/local/cap-metro-oks-520-million-in-contracts-outsourcing-2321526.html\">&quot;Cap Metro OKs $520 million in contracts, outsourcing all bus service,&quot;</a> April 23, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Clay", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1830, "last_name": "Dafoe", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "clay-dafoe", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/dafoemugcrop.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1830/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays bus riders subsidize the &quot;expensive, romanticized&quot; Leander-to-Austin train.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a mayoral candidate debate on KXAN-TV", "statement_date": "2012-04-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>We strive to make our work completely accurate.
