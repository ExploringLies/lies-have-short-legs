Jeff Flake as &quot;weak on crime &amp; border!&quot; on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/900346953120141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F\">Twitter</a>. A pro-Trump super PAC is <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/321/201708239071117321/201708239071117321.pdf\">spending</a> $20,000 on Ward, who has <a href=\"https://www.kelliward.com/about\">cribbed</a> the president&rsquo;s style in her campaign to &quot;make Arizona great again.&quot; The physician served two terms in the Arizona state Senate and lost a 2016 challenge for Sen. John McCain&rsquo;s seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund is stepping up for Flake with a 77-second video that knocked Ward as &quot;Chemtrail Kelli&quot; four times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ward wasted your tax dollars for a town hall on chemtrail conspiracy theories,&quot; the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNTtiRrMQRs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">attack ad</a> posted Aug. 22, 2017, says. &quot;Sponsoring chemtrail legislation? &lsquo;I&rsquo;m open, I introduce legislation for constituents all the time.&rsquo; About another chemtrail town hall? &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do it again. Of course I&rsquo;ll do it again.&rsquo; Chemtrail Kelli&rsquo;s got her head in the clouds with crazy ideas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to take a closer look at the links the video made between Ward and chemtrails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video is correct in saying that Ward hosted a town hall on the issue. But the ad ignores her record of saying she does not believe in the theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Ward&#39;s chemtrail comments in context</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the conspiracy world, chemtrails are chemical or biological agents dispersed by aircrafts as part of a government plot to control the weather and human behavior. But scientists <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011\">generally agree</a> that the cloud-like formations that linger in an aircraft&rsquo;s trail are basically condensation marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2014, Ward invited constituents of her state Senate district to a small, informational seminar on chemtrails by two Arizona Department of Environmental Quality staffers in Kingman, Ariz. Some audience members then provided testimony and asked questions of the staffers and Ward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The town hall was conducted in response to constituent concerns, and experts were brought in to directly refute those concerns,&quot; Ward&rsquo;s spokeswoman Jennifer Lawrence said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad plucked quotes that made Ward seem like a conspiracy theorist herself. The full quote from her closing remarks at the town hall about being &quot;open&quot; to sponsoring legislation to investigate chemtrails is more nuanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With this particular issue I think it&rsquo;s going to be very difficult because, unless you get away from the chemtrail issue that you all are so passionate about, talking about our environmental quality I think can go further in terms of making sure that there aren&rsquo;t any public health issues that are out there with our water, our soil, or our air,&quot; Ward said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/is-the-tea-party-afraid-of-john-mccain-116977\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelliwardaz/status/588432692418514944\">said</a> she doesn&rsquo;t subscribe to this belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t believe in the chemtrail theory,&quot; she <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/is-the-tea-party-afraid-of-john-mccain-116977\">told</a> Politico in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She explained in a 2016 radio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U4dImSaaR0\">interview</a> that she considers it her duty as an elected official to respond to her constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attack ad singled out a snippet of the interview of Ward.&nbsp;&quot;About another chemtrail town hall?&quot; the video asks. &quot;I&rsquo;ll do it again. Of course I&rsquo;ll do it again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, a later part of the interview talks about the need to listen to constituents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People say, well, would you do it again? Of course I&#39;ll do it again because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to do when you&rsquo;re elected,&quot; Ward said. &quot;You&rsquo;re supposed to listen to the people and you&rsquo;re supposed to get them the information that they need to feel confident that they live in a safe environment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A Senate Leadership Fund ad said Ward&nbsp;hosted a town hall on chemtrails and was willing to sponsor legislation on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calling Ward &quot;Chemtrail Kelli&quot; repeatedly and saying she has her &quot;head in the clouds with crazy ideas&quot; wrongly suggests she believes in the conspiracy theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward did host a town hall on chemtrails, but she has not expressed belief in chemtrails. She has not held further town halls or sponsored any legislation on the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-24T18:39:02.284623", "ruling_date": "2017-08-25T11:24:04", "ruling_headline": "No, Kelli Ward isn't a chemtrails conspiracy theorist", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-kelli-ward-isnt-chemtrails-conspiracy-theorist", "ruling_link_text": "Spins the facts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Senate Leadership Fund, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNTtiRrMQRs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">&quot;ChemtrailKelli&quot;
