That&#39;s absolutely crazy,&quot; he said <a href=\"http://www.wpri.com/subindex/on_air/newsmakers\" id=\"i05-\" title=\"during an appearance on Newsmakers\">during an appearance on Newsmakers</a>. &quot;We need to have one plan for all workers, whether you&#39;re a judge, whether you&#39;re a state trooper, whether you work for the city of Warwick as a maintenance person. One plan should fit every single person.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne hundred fifty is a lot of pension plans, even for a state with 39 cities and towns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we first checked with the general treasurer&#39;s office, which handles the state-run programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChief of Staff Mark A. Dingley said the state has four such programs and he sent us the latest audit reports for all of them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost state employees and teachers are covered by the <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/2010/pdf/teachersemployees09.pdf\" id=\"y8gl\" title=\"Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island\">Employees&#39; Retirement System of Rhode Island</a> (ERSRI). The state employees portion of that system was funded at 59 percent for 24,661 employees and retirees as of June 30, 2009, the most recent figures available. The teachers portion was funded at 58.1 percent for 25,904 employees and retirees. Ideally, b<font>oth should be at 100 percent.</font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen there&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/2010/pdf/statepolice09.pdf\" id=\"v0ls\" title=\"State Police Retirement Benefits Trust\">State Police Retirement Benefits Trust</a>, which covered 182 people as of June 30, 2009. It has 79.8 percent of the money it should have to be fully funded, according to last year&#39;s actuarial valuation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThird is the <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/2010/pdf/judicialpensions09.pdf\" id=\"rpzc\" title=\"Judicial Retirement Benefits Trust\">Judicial Retirement Benefits Trust</a> for the state&#39;s judges and retired judges. There were 55 in June 2009. The plan is funded at 88.3 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFourth is the state-run <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/2010/pdf/municipalpensions09.pdf\" id=\"u5br\" title=\"Municipal Employees' Retirement System\">Municipal Employees&#39; Retirement System</a> (MERS) which covers 109 pension programs within various cities, towns or region. As of last year, it covered 7,952 employees and 4,389 retirees. All 109 programs are funded separately to various degrees by their municipality. Thirty six are funded at 100 percent or higher, and 10 have less than 70 percent of the money they should have.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe four programs actually represent 113 different named pension plans, if you count the program for teachers and other state employees as two separate ones. Dingley said all 113 have very similar provisions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the state level, there are five different designs of pension plans.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut wait, there&#39;s more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are 36 municipal pension programs in 24 communities that are administered by their respective cities and towns. &quot;They would all have different designs,&quot; said Dingley.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor information on them, we went to the Office of the Auditor General and found its <a href=\"http://www.oag.state.ri.us/reports/Local_Pensions_0310.pdf\" id=\"p-c2\" title=\"March 2010 report\">March 2010 report</a> assessing their health. Nearly two thirds of those plans are considered at risk because they don&#39;t have enough money to cover projected expenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly 11 have at least 70 percent of the funding they need and 19 are funded below the 50 percent level. &quot;Some are so small they only cover one or two people,&quot; Dingley said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings the total to 149, or 148 if you include the state teachers and state employees plans as one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDingley said he&#39;s not sure how easy it would be to combine them, as King is recommending. The ones that cover police and fire &quot;are designed very differently because of the hazardous nature of the work. You don&#39;t want to see a 60-year-old fireman or policeman still working, because they can&#39;t go up the ladder and carry someone down, or they&#39;re not effective against young criminals, etc.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Likewise for judges, who tend to be appointed later in their careers, so those designs take that career track into account. Those have traditionally been different,&quot; said Dingley. &quot;But aside from that, there is a strong argument to be made that the rest should have a uniform design.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bigger question, given how poorly-funded some of the plans are, &quot;is who makes up the huge deficits,&quot; Dingley said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, King&#39;s count of the number of public pension plans in Rhode Island isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s close enough for us, so we rate his statement as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-27T17:23:28.551922", "ruling_date": "2010-08-30T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "King says Rhode Island's public employees have 150 different pension plans", "ruling_headline_slug": "king-says-rhode-islands-public-employees-have-150-", "ruling_link_text": "And most are underfunded", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWPRI-TV, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wpri.com/subindex/on_air/newsmakers\" id=\"wisx\" title=\"Newsmakers 8/21: Kerry King\">Newsmakers 8/21: Kerry King</a>,&quot; Aug. 21,2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews, Mark A.
