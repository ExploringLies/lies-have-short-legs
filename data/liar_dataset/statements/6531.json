The truth is not as clear as Ryan makes it appear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe know Ryan and Romney are pushing for Medicare reforms that would spare beneficiaries 55 and over. Their proposals would create voucher-like credits for future retirees to shop for their own plans, either traditional Medicare or a private plan, starting in 2023. If Ryan were talking only about this part of the plan, he&#39;d be correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Romney and Ryan have also pledged to &quot;repeal and replace&quot; the Affordable Care Act, which Ryan attacked several times during his comments. The health law included several new benefits for Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s an overview of what Obama&#39;s health law offers Medicare beneficiaries:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. </strong>Everyone on Medicare is now eligible for <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/65-older/medicare-preventive-services/index.html\">free preventive care </a>as a result of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s health care law. Seniors&rsquo; annual wellness visits would be covered, as well as flu shots and a number of screenings for cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, HIV, and cholesterol (complete <a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html\">list is here</a>). These services would not require co-pays.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The &lsquo;doughnut hole.&rsquo;</strong> The law gradually closes the so-called &quot;doughnut hole&quot; for seniors on the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program over 10 years. Before the law, seniors whose annual drug costs exceeded $2,830 shouldered the entire payment without government assistance until they hit an out of pocket limit of $4,550. Once &quot;catastrophic coverage&quot; is triggered, the government paid 95 percent of costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe health care law gives beneficiaries who reach the doughnut hole a $250 tax-free rebate. Federal subsidies will kick in, gradually reducing the patient&rsquo;s share of the payment from 100 percent to 25 percent by 2020.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlus, seniors in the doughnut hole receive a 50 percent discount on <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/65-older/drug-discounts/index.html\">covered brand-name drugs</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Restoring $716 billion in Medicare cost savings.</strong> Romney has said he will replenish $716 billion in Medicare spending reductions in the health care law over the next decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome analysts say reinstating the savings will will drive up premiums for Medicare Part B beneficiaries, reported the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/us/politics/costs-seen-in-romneys-medicare-savings-plan.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times</a>&nbsp;</em>on Aug. 21, 2012. Premiums are pegged to Medicare&rsquo;s overall costs, so when costs go up, premiums go up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMarilyn Moon, vice president and director of the health program at the American Institutes for Research, used official data to compute how out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries might increase. We reached Moon, and she reviewed her methodology with us.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe calculated that restoring the Medicare spending would raise co-payments and premiums by by $342 a year on average over the next 10 years. By 2022, the annual increase would rise to $577.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign did not refute the <em>Times</em> story. Instead they pointed us to Romney&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care\">campaign website </a>and a <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/news/press/2012/08/memorandum-2\">memo </a>from campaign policy director Lanhee Chan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe memo criticizes the Medicare reductions, saying the reduced payments to hospitals will jeopardize seniors&rsquo; care and that people on Medicare Advantage, the private-public plan, will lose their coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney and Ryan have argued the health care law will hurt seniors, and that it&rsquo;s better for the market to determine what doctors and hospitals should be paid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut repealing the law will affect seniors, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan wants seniors to know his and Romney&rsquo;s Medicare plan &quot;does not affect your benefits.&quot; &nbsp;Indeed, that&rsquo;s the case for their Medicare reform ideas, which would not affect people currently 55 and older.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut his assurance does not take into account one very large elephant in the room: the federal health care law, which alters Medicare primarily by extending more benefits and savings. Romney and Ryan want to &quot;repeal and replace Obamacare,&quot; but they haven&rsquo;t said with what. Repealing the law would take away benefits for current enrollees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome experts say it&rsquo;s unrealistic to expect that level of policy detail. Maybe so, but until the leaders expound upon their plans for closing the doughnut hole for prescription drugs, as well as a number of other Affordable Care Act provisions that would disappear with repeal, we think it&rsquo;s unrealistic to assure seniors their Medicare provisions wouldn&rsquo;t change under a Romney-Ryan administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-24T14:21:41.901830", "ruling_date": "2012-08-24T15:16:28", "ruling_headline": "Paul Ryan says his plan would not affect current Medicare benefits", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-ryan-says-his-plan-would-not-affect-current-m", "ruling_link_text": "Repealing 'Obamacare' takes away benefits", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCNN Transcripts, &quot;<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1208/18/bn.01.html\">Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan Delivers Remarks in The Villages, Florida</a>,&quot; Aug. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation, Aug. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Robert Moffit, senior fellow in the Center for Policy Innovation at The Heritage Foundation, Aug. 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert Moffit lecture, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/2012/08/premium-support-medicares-future-and-its-critics\">Premium Support: Medicare&#39;s Future and its Critics</a>,&quot; Aug. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/us/politics/costs-seen-in-romneys-medicare-savings-plan.html?pagewanted=all\">Patients Would Pay More if Romney Restores Medicare Savings, Analysts Say</a>,&quot; Aug. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Ryan Williams, Romney spokesman Aug. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Kara Carscaden, Obama spokeswoman, Aug. 24, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Marilyn Moon, Aug. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitt Romney&rsquo;s campaign website, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/medicare\">Medicare section</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedicare.gov, <a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html\">Part B covered preventive and screening services</a>, accessed Aug. 24, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 24, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 373, "last_name": "Ryan", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "paul-ryan", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_WX201_HOUSE_2016_PRIMARI.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/373/", "total_count": 89, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.house.gov/ryan/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe Romney-Ryan plan for Medicare &quot;does not affect&quot; benefits for anyone 55 or older.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign stop at The Villages", "statement_date": "2012-08-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
