Trump was often critical of the deal on the campaign trail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two weeks before the Feb. 15 news conference, Iran tested a medium-range ballistic missile that could theoretically reach Israel, as well as many other targets in the region. The Trump administration considers Iran&rsquo;s Jan. 29 test to be against the terms of the agreement, while Iran considers it permissible. Days later, the Trump administration announced <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sanctions-iran-on-missile-test/2017/02/03/dfb101ce-4107-409e-ab45-f49449e92c1f_story.html?utm_term=.88feebc3837e\">new sanctions</a> on Iran, specifically citing the missile test as the reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the news conference, Netanyahu said his goal, and Trump&rsquo;s, is to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think beyond that,&quot; he said, &quot;President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations &mdash; Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, &lsquo;Israel must be destroyed.&rsquo; Iranian Foreign Minister (Mohammad Javad) Zarif said, &lsquo;Our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country.&rsquo; No, they write on the missiles in Hebrew, &lsquo;Israel must be destroyed.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader asked us to check what Netanyahu said about the Hebrew lettering. So we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not reply to an inquiry, but we found news reports from March 2016, such as <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-fires-2-missiles-marked-with-israel-must-be-wiped-out/\">this one</a> in the <em>Times of Israel</em>, that discussed such an incident. The claim was sourced to the Fars news service, which has been described as a &quot;semi-official&quot; organ of the Iranian government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tracked down the <a href=\"http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13941219000355\">Fars article</a>, dated March 9, 2016. It said that the the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/iran/irans-revolutionary-guards/p14324\">Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps</a> had successfully launched two &quot;Qadr H&quot; ballistic missiles at a target in southeastern Iran 1,400 kilometers away. It described the Qadr as a liquid-fueled ballistic missile that &quot;can reach territories as far as Israel.&quot; (The Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/iran-fires-ballistic-missiles-marked-israel-must-be-wiped-out-434989\">condemned the test</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One missile,&quot; the Fars post said, &quot;had a message written on it that said in Hebrew, &lsquo;Israel should be wiped off the Earth.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The English-language version of the Fars site didn&rsquo;t include the exact words, but the <em>Times of Israe</em>l article showed a screenshot of the Farsi-language page, which specifies the Hebrew phrase &quot;Yisrael Tsricha LeHimachek Me&rsquo;Al.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qbI0ATpn1D2y5vG1jiUwFbxjXE1_XHZNud1VRS5DsqEXsrDFn_5qAXHrcdD1BDjxTXe9bj2B2UFC0mloqxOm98HW7ZEXs54vbH-id6n6yvQJ_v8_HbMWkENSyJARR-MmecVPN9BI\" style=\"border:none; height:557px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Times of Israel</em> noted dryly that &quot;the words mean &lsquo;Israel must be wiped out from.&rsquo; Apparently, Iran&rsquo;s Hebrew writers intended to complete the phrase with something to the effect of &lsquo;the face of the Earth&rsquo; but messed up their translation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The translation of the Hebrew in the <em>Times of Israel</em> article is accurate, said Michael J. Koplow, policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, a group that advocates for a negotiated two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Koplow and other experts said they see no reason to doubt the accuracy of the Fars post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This story has the ring of truth to it because I do not see why Iran would lie about it,&quot; said Michael M. Gunter, a Tennessee Technological University political scientist who studies the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We won&rsquo;t quibble over the exact wording, which Netanyahu got wrong but which conveys the same message. But we will raise one caveat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing Netanyahu&rsquo;s comments, one could assume that he&rsquo;s talking about the most recent missile tests from January 2017, rather than the ones from 2016. Not only did his comment about the Hebrew lettering immediately follow a mention of the most recent tests, but he used the present tense to say that &quot;these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence that the most recent round of tests included missiles with threats written in Hebrew letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is striking to me that Prime Minister Netanyahu must go back to an Iranian report of a March 2016 ballistic missile test to make his point about malign Iranian intentions,&quot; said Greg Thielmann, a former foreign service officer and Senate Intelligence Committee staffer who is now a board member at the Arms Control Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He suggested that the Hebrew lettering may have been &quot;a one-time event, and not necessarily authorized in Tehran.&quot; The botching of the text may suggest that the gambit was ad-hoc &quot;sloganeering&quot; by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, &quot;rather than an explicit policy dictated from the top,&quot; Thielmann said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Netanyahu said, &quot;President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations -- Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, &lsquo;Israel must be destroyed.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right that there was such an incident (with slightly different wording) during an Iranian ballistic missile launch in 2016. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that, despite Netanyahu&rsquo;s implication, there is no evidence of a repeat when Iran undertook its most recent test in 2017. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae08540a-2931-4912-8149-8db6ea117789\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae08540a-2931-4912-8149-8db6ea117789</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-15T17:19:36.534785", "ruling_date": "2017-02-15T18:06:38", "ruling_headline": "Benjamin Netanyahu largely correct on Iranian missiles with Hebrew-language threats", "ruling_headline_slug": "benjamin-netanyahu-largely-correct-iranian-missile", "ruling_link_text": "It happened, though not weeks ago", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4079&amp;v=5Gfih7ZyuVw\">remarks at a press conference with President Donald Trump</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5043267?13\">Feb. 15, 2017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fars News Agency, &quot;<a href=\"http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13941219000355\">Iran Fires 2 Ballistic Missiles at Targets 1400km in Distance</a>,&quot; March 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Times of Israel</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-fires-2-missiles-marked-with-israel-must-be-wiped-out/\">Iran test-fires 2 missiles marked with &lsquo;Israel must be wiped out</a>,&rsquo; &quot; March 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Council on Foreign Relations, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/iran/irans-revolutionary-guards/p14324\">Backgrounder: Iran&#39;s Revolutionary Guards</a>,&quot; June 14, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Newsweek</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/iran-fires-ballistic-missiles-marked-israel-must-be-wiped-out-434989\">Iran Tests Ballistic Missiles Carrying the Message, &#39;Israel Must Be Wiped Out,&#39;</a> &quot; March 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sanctions-iran-on-missile-test/2017/02/03/dfb101ce-4107-409e-ab45-f49449e92c1f_story.html?utm_term=.88feebc3837e\">Trump administration sanctions Iran over missile test</a>,&quot; Feb. 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2015/apr/23/iranian-missiles-and-eastern-us-how-big-fla/\">Iranian missiles and the eastern U.S.: How big a threat?</a>&quot; April 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Greg Thielmann, board member at the Arms Control Association, Feb. 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Michael J.
