Debt won&#39;t hold you back. Read Hillary&#39;s plan: <a href=\"http://hrc.io/college\">http://hrc.io/college</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bush camp <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/630847558047375360\">replied</a> by tweaking the original visuals and saying, &quot;100%: The increase in student debt under this Democratic White House.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the Clinton camp <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/630889514618195968\">shot back</a> by &quot;scribbling over&quot; Bush&rsquo;s graphic with the following claim: &quot;F: The grade given to Florida for college affordability under Jeb Bush&#39;s leadership.&quot; It cited the the Center for Public Policy and Higher Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So did&nbsp;Florida received an F for college affordability when Bush was governor from 1999 to 2007? There is some evidence to back this up, but Clinton&#39;s jab leaves out important context on the cost of Florida higher education during the Bush years.&nbsp;(We separately checked Bush&rsquo;s claim about the increase in debt.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim comes from the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://highereducation.org\">Center for Public Policy and Higher Education</a>, which <a href=\"http://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/02/17/the-planned-death-of-a-nonprofit-the-national-center-for-public-policy-and-higher-education/\">shut its doors in 2010</a>.&nbsp;The independent group, funded by philanthropies such as Pew Charitable Trusts and the Ford Foundation, graded states every two years on a variety of metrics for higher education. One was &quot;affordability.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In looking at this subject, the group sought to answer this question: &quot;How difficult is it to pay for college in each state when family income, the cost of attending college, and student financial assistance are taken into account?&quot;&nbsp;To do this, researchers considered such criteria as tuition for community colleges and public and private four-year colleges and universities; the degree of state investments in need-based financial aid; and the extent of student debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the year cited in Clinton&rsquo;s tweet -- <a href=\"http://www.highereducation.org/reports/mup_06/MUP-06.pdf\">2006</a> -- Florida did receive an F for affordability. And it wasn&rsquo;t the only time: In <a href=\"http://www.highereducation.org/reports/mu04/National%20Report1.pdf\">2004</a>, the study also gave Florida an F.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But&nbsp;Florida was hardly alone in flunking the affordability test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, the year the Clinton camp selected for the tweet, every state but seven received an F, and those &quot;lucky&quot; seven states didn&rsquo;t do much better: Five ended up with a D while two got a C.&nbsp;The missing context from the tweet, then, is that Florida was not uniquely bad -- not by a longshot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our own&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/jun/30/florida-democratic-party/florida-dems-say-tuition-went-482-percent-jeb-bush/\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">previous fact-checking</a>&nbsp;concluded that while tuition went up under Bush, it did so at a rate slower than the national average. We found that Bush signed budgets in which the Legislature increased tuition substantially, but we also found that in-state, undergraduate tuition in Florida was still modest compared to to other states when Bush left office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s team cited several policies he helped institute on education: He&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.floridacollegeaccess.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PRBfirstgeneration.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">put in place</a>&nbsp;a First Generation Matching Grant for Floridians who are the first in their families to attend college;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flbog.edu/about/_doc/cod/asa/FinalAccessDiversityReport.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">gave</a>&nbsp;the Florida Student Assistance Grant Program a record 21.9 percent increase in 2006; and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.floridastudentfinancialaid.org/SSFAD/pdf/annualreport06-07.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">expanded</a>&nbsp;the lottery-funded Bright Futures Medallion Scholarship program to cover 100 percent of community-college tuition fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the reports cannot be discounted entirely.&nbsp;Troy Miller, associate director for research and policy for the student advocacy group the Florida College Access Network, said the reports were important because they looked at whether state&rsquo;s residents could typically afford the price tag of college in their state. &quot;The way the authors evaluate affordability is valid, even if their grading scale is arbitrary,&quot; such as the fact that most states received an F, Miller said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miller added that Florida may have suffered in the ratings because of the Bright Futures program, which was a merit-based program, not one that was need-based. The report points out &quot;that Florida awards little state aid on the basis of need relative to other states,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that under Jeb Bush, Florida got an F for college affordability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report on which her campaign is basing the claim confirms that in 2006 Florida received an F in this category. Still, it&rsquo;s worth noting that 43 of the 50 states scored an F in 2006, meaning that Florida&rsquo;s grade wasn&rsquo;t uniquely bad. And while tuition did increase on Bush&rsquo;s watch, the rate of increase was smaller than the national average. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-12T10:30:18.490790", "ruling_date": "2015-08-14T10:00:02", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton tweets that Florida got an F for college affordability under Jeb Bush", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-tweets-florida-got-f-college-affor", "ruling_link_text": "Singling out Bush for a widespread problem", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/630889514618195968\"><u>tweet</u></a>, Aug. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, &quot;Measuring Up&quot; biennial report cards, <a href=\"http://www.highereducation.org/reports/mup_06/MUP-06.pdf\"><u>2006</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.highereducation.org/reports/mu04/National%20Report1.pdf\"><u>2004</u></a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110322074907/http://measuringup.highereducation.org/2002/pdf/MeasUp2002.pdf\"><u>2002</u></a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030414225205/http://measuringup.highereducation.org/2000/Affordability.cfm\"><u>2000</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Joni E.
