In a new TV ad, Barrett repeats that claim and then adds this one:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It turns out there&#39;s a lot we didn&#39;t know about Scott Walker,&quot; a narrator says as an image of a birth-control pill case dominates the screen. &quot;Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rated as <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/18/planned-parenthood/planned-parenthood-says-scott-walker-tried-pass-bi/\">Barely True</a> a claim by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin that Walker &quot;tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women&#39;s access to birth control.&quot; That claim centered on a bill that would let pharmacists refuse to dispense contraceptives on moral grounds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBarrett&rsquo;s new claim goes much further.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn outright ban on birth control?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs evidence, the Barrett campaign points to an endorsement Walker received by the group <a href=\"http://www.prolifewisconsin.org/\">Pro-Life Wisconsin</a> (running mate Rebecca Kleefisch was endorsed, too) and a questionnaire he filled out before receiving it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was little surprise when Walker won the endorsement of Wisconsin Right to Life, the state&rsquo;s largest anti-abortion group. But the smaller, more staunchly conservative Pro-Life Wisconsin says it has not endorsed a gubernatorial candidate for years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt insists that candidates, to get the endorsement, perfectly line up with its views as expressed on a survey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker campaign spokeswoman Jill Bader said the survey, which Walker scored 100 percent on, does not include any birth control questions. That&rsquo;s not quite true. It includes one that asks the pharmacist question and one that asks if candidates would block minors from receiving taxpayer-funded contraceptives. Walker answered yes to both.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett&rsquo;s campaign, though, points to the first question on <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/PLWCandidateSurvey.doc\">the survey</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Would you sign legislation that declares that a preborn child has an inalienable right to life from the moment of fertilization forward?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome background:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe question refers to &quot;personhood&quot; rights, a growing national movement in some pro-life circles to use state laws or state constitutions to bestow full citizenship rights and protections to the unborn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPro-Life Wisconsin and related groups in other states oppose all forms of artificial birth control, They hope that &quot;personhood&quot; rights will bring a ban on all abortions -- and a ban on the pill, the group&rsquo;s legislative director Matt Sande told PolitiFact Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther anti-abortion groups have focused on a more direct route: The U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1973 held that a woman&#39;s decision to have an abortion is a private choice that is protected by the U.S. Constitution. That Roe vs. Wade decision still defines the issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPro-Life Wisconsin&rsquo;s definition of pregnancy as starting at fertilization differs from the worldwide mainstream view that it begins when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, said Raj Narayan, Medical College of Wisconsin physician and associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBirth control pills work, when used properly, by preventing ovulation, not by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg, he said. In theory, birth control pills could prevent implantation, but it is unprovable scientifically, Narayan said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the view of Pro-Life Wisconsin, there are cases -- even if a very small percentage -- where a fertilized egg (already a full citizen, under the theoretical legislation) is prevented by the pill from attaching to the womb. That, they say, constitutes an abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, <a href=\"http://www.wrtl.org/\">Wisconsin Right to </a><a href=\"http://www.wrtl.org/\">Life</a> views the idea that the pill causes abortions as &quot;speculation,&quot; according to executive director Barbara Lyons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe view is disputed, too, by the mainstream medical community, as Narayan noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s important for our evaluation, though, is the political realm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Walker know about -- and agree with -- the group&rsquo;s views on birth control as causing abortion?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the 2010 election, candidates were given survey instructions and a memo entitled &quot;Hormonal Birth Control and its Abortion Causing Effect,&quot; according to Sande. That <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/BirthControlAbortion.doc\">memo</a> clearly lays out the group&rsquo;s view that &quot;any artificial action that works to destroy a human embryo is abortifacient in nature.&quot; It lumps &quot;most if not all birth control drugs and devices&quot; into that category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSande downplays the chances Pro-Life Wisconsin will succeed in its anti birth-control agenda because it believes society is not ready for it. But a birth control ban is the group&rsquo;s aim. Its mechanism to get there is &quot;personhood&quot; legislation -- Question 1 on the candidate survey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince 2006, the group has been laying the groundwork for its proposed constitutional amendment. Elsewhere, such efforts are further along. Colorado voters will consider a &quot;personhood&quot; amendment in the Nov. 2, 2010 election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to ask Walker to clarify his view on the topic. The campaign did not make him available. In an e-mail, Bader said: &quot;Scott is pro-life. He believes that government has no role in whether adults choose to use birth control or not. This was Scott&rsquo;s view of that question on the survey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe noted -- as do we -- no direct question on a birth control ban was asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett&rsquo;s side countered that the implications of the question were made clear. Said spokesman Phil Walzak: &quot;They want to currry favor and get that 100% rating, but when they are called on it they hedge.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere does the group asking the survey question come down?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSande, of Pro-Life Wisconsin, agreed Walker signed onto the concept based on his answer, but said he thought it would be unfair to draw the conclusion Walker supports a particular &quot;personhood&quot; initiative. After all, no proposed language was given. And the birth-control ban is not part of the group&rsquo;s immediate legislative agenda.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow it&rsquo;s our turn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Barrett campaign makes a strong claim against Walker, saying he supports a ban on commonly used contraceptives. It bases its statement on a survey by Pro-Life Wisconsin that did not ask that question directly. Rather, Barrett -- and the group -- say it is embedded in a question about a potential legislation on &quot;personhood,&quot; that is giving full human rights at the moment of fertilization.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn viewing the pill as abortion, not just birth control, there is no question the group is out of step with medicine -- and the larger group, Wisconsin Right to Life. Barrett argues by supporting the question in the survey, a candidate signs on to this view as well. Walker&rsquo;s campaign disputes this. Walker did, however, did get the group&rsquo;s memo which clearly outlined its views and goals. Did he read it? He should have if he is answering the group&rsquo;s questions. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, we don&rsquo;t know -- and neither does the Barrett campaign, which leaves out important details in its hard-line statement. We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-29T20:23:46.705282", "ruling_date": "2010-11-01T09:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Tom Barrett says Scott Walker wants to ban the pill and other forms of birth control ", "ruling_headline_slug": "tom-barrett-says-scott-walker-wants-ban-pill-and-o", "ruling_link_text": "Pro-Life Wisconsin's survey included 'personhood' question, through which it -- like some other groups -- defines the pill as abortion", "ruling_state": "Wisconsin", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPro Life Wisconsin website, <a href=\"http://www.prolifewisconsin.org/proLifeIssues.asp?article=Hormonal+Birth+Control+and+its+Abortion+Causing+Effect&amp;aid=270&amp;id=6#topNews\">Hormonal Birth &nbsp;Control and Its Abortion Causing Effect</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPro-Life Wisconsin &nbsp;website, <a href=\"http://www.prolifewisconsin.org/proLifeIssues.asp?id=7\">Personhood</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/104221094.html\">Abortion, birth control are wedge issues in governor&#39;s race</a>, Oct. 2, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, <a href=\"http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20100712/APC0101/7120517/Wisconsin-governor-candidates-Scott-Walker-and-Mark-Neumann-join-abortion-debate\">Wisconsin governor candidates Scott Walker and Mark Neumann join abortion debate,</a> July 12, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPersonhood CO website, <a href=\"http://www.personhoodcolorado.com/birth-control-talking-points\">Birth Control Talking Points</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview, Jill Bader, Walker campaign spokesperson, Oct. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview, Phil Walzak, Barrett campaign spokesperson, Oct. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Clarke Forsythe, Americans United for Life, Oct. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Barbara Lyons, Wisconsin Right to Life, Oct. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin, Oct. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview, Amanda Harrington, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Johanna Dasteel, American Life League, Oct. 28, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Mayor of Milwaukee", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Tom", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 641, "last_name": "Barrett", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "tom-barrett", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Barrett_Tom_PFACT_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/641/", "total_count": 26, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.barrettforwisconsin.com/"}, "statement": "<h2 id=\"internal-source-marker_0.9757482264875382\">\r\n\tSays &quot;Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill.&quot;</h2>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign TV ad", "statement_date": "2010-10-28", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 11, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/11/", "subject": "Abortion", "subject_slug": "abortion", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
