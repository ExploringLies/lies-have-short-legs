Michael Williams, a Republican candidate running in Georgia&rsquo;s gubernatorial primary, recently came out against any legislation banning the devices, which can be attached to a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To stress his point, he announced he would give away a free bump stock to a random person who enters the giveaway event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians,&quot; Williams <a href=\"https://williamsgeorgia.com/republican-candidate-georgia-governor-opposes-bump-stock-ban-announces-bump-stock-giveaway/\">said in a news release</a>. &quot;In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams continued: &quot;Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter&rsquo;s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures (sic) due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That didn&rsquo;t sound right to us, because the basic point of a bump stock is to help someone shoot really fast. The device allows the recoil from firing a semiautomatic weapon to slide the firearm back and forth. The movement &quot;bumps&quot; the trigger against the shooter&rsquo;s finger without having to manually squeeze the trigger for each shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that police have not yet said precisely which weapons were used in the shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we wanted to look into the claim that the gunman would have hurt fewer people had he not had the ability to fire rapidly. Is this a popular expert opinion?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What the experts say</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So who are these experts? We reached out to Williams and his campaign but received no response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign has previously <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/georgia-governor-candidate-bump-stock/index.html\">pointed</a> to a <a href=\"https://legallyarmedamerica.com/2017/10/05/why-banning-bump-fire-stocks-is-not-the-answer/\">post from Legally Armed America</a> &mdash; written by Paul Glasco, who reviews guns and gun products &mdash;&nbsp;that argued that a ban on bump fire stocks would be useless to prevent these kind of attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of our own research, we talked to five experts who said Williams is factually correct on one point about the nature of this attachment: Because because bump stocks use a weapon&rsquo;s recoil to allow the user to fire rapidly and repeatedly, the use of a bump stock makes the weapon more difficult to control when firing. This decreases the weapon&rsquo;s accuracy, which depends on a weapon&rsquo;s steadiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two experts supportive of gun rights &mdash; United States Concealed Carry Association president Tim Schmidt and lawyer John Pierce &mdash; were not convinced bump stocks would have made the crime more deadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They agreed that a more accurate weapon could have hurt more people, but they needed more information about the crime to come to a conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But three of the five experts said the rapid gunfire is likely what made the recent shooting so devastating.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Precise aim was not a requirement; hundreds were injured.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in firearms, said the use of a semiautomatic weapon without a bump stock would have made a difference if the Las Vegas gunman was trying to hurt a specific person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you don&rsquo;t care who you hit, being a little more inaccurate doesn&rsquo;t matter,&quot; Winkler said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, Arthur Alphin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and West Point graduate, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-las-vegas-shooting-live-updates-the-trigonometry-of-terror-why-the-las-1507085772-htmlstory.html\">made the case</a> to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that accuracy did matter, but so did the rapid fire. The weapon could have been held steady with a bipod, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacquiHeinrich/status/915182518587891712\">which was found in the gunman&rsquo;s room</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the gunman had been trained by military or law enforcement, an unaltered semiautomatic weapon could have been more harmful than one outfitted with a bump stock, said Rick Vasquez, a former assistant chief and acting chief of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&rsquo; firearms technology branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But given the gunman&rsquo;s lack of formal training and the fact that the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest music festival was somewhat blocked in, &quot;any device that is going to spray a lot of ammunition is going to be more deadly,&quot; Vasquez said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He was shooting into a densely packed crowd of thousands of people,&quot; said Gary Kleck, a criminologist from Florida State University who studies the effects of guns on injuries and death in crimes. &quot;The main effect of using bump stocks in this particular situation was to increase the number of rounds the shooter could fire in a short period of time before police crashed into his hotel room, which increased the numbers of victims hit somewhat randomly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams said many firearms experts have determined that the use of a bump stock in the Las Vegas shooting prevented more injuries and deaths than would have otherwise occurred had he not used a bump stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of a blog from a pro-gun rights group, we did not find &quot;many firearms experts&quot; making that argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did learn that bump stock devices tend to affect a weapon&rsquo;s accuracy. But we found several firearms experts who attributed the high number of people injured and killed to the shooter&rsquo;s ability to fire rapidly, which a bump stock would have amplified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-09T18:30:49.379960", "ruling_date": "2017-11-13T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did bump stocks prevent more casualties in Las Vegas?
