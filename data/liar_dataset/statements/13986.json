Another factor: the rise of fentanyl, an often illegally produced and sold painkiller of super high potency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In America,&quot; Schimel added, &quot;more people die from the painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is he right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digging into the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Schimel&rsquo;s claim, his office provided a 2011 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2011/p1101_flu_pain_killer_overdose.html\">news release</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that quoted <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/policyimpact-prescriptionpainkillerod-a.pdf\">2008 figures </a>on prescription painkiller use, abuse and related deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Overdoses involving prescription painkillers are at epidemic levels and now kill more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined,&quot; the release quoted CDC Director Thomas Frieden as saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the surface, it&rsquo;s compelling -- if very dated -- evidence for Schimel&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a deeper dive, and a look at more recent trends, tells a somewhat different story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, heroin deaths were just starting to take off, and illegally made and distributed knockoffs of prescription fentanyl were not yet a huge story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that time, the number of deaths involving prescription painkillers greatly exceeded those involving heroin and cocaine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when Schimel spoke, much more recent figures were available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, the CDC estimated that heroin and cocaine deaths were more than double the 2008 total, largely due to spiking heroin use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, prescription opioid-involved deaths had risen but not as fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s do the 2015 math on Schimel&rsquo;s equation: there were 12,998 heroin-related deaths and 6,784 deaths involving cocaine, per the CDC&rsquo;s National Center for Health Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total: 19,782.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a spokesman at the CDC&rsquo;s National Center for Health Statistics offered this total for prescription painkiller deaths: 17,536.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So by the agency&rsquo;s own math, based on its <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/health/opioid-deaths-2015/\">widely publicized number</a>, Schimel&rsquo;s claim doesn&rsquo;t hold up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But -- stay with us -- that doesn&rsquo;t leave the attorney general without a leg to stand on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/prescription-opioid-overdose-deaths-and-death-rate-per-100000-population-age-adjusted/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">creditable health-care organizations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates\">federal agencies</a> say there were 22,598 deaths involving one or more prescription opioid painkillers -- a figure that would make Schimel&rsquo;s claim accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And those organizations are citing numbers published by the CDC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can that be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Changing definitions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The confusion is over an adjustment the CDC made regarding fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that is sold both as a prescription medicine and as an illegally produced street drug used to intensify the high of other drugs such as heroin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, the CDC decided to narrow what it considers &quot;prescription&quot; opioids because law enforcement reports suggested many of the deaths involving fentanyl were from the non-prescription street version of the drug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the agency removed some or all synthetic opioids from the &quot;prescription&quot; death tally, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/analysis.html\">saying it&rsquo;s a better way</a> to portray what&rsquo;s really happening. It&rsquo;s not a perfect fix -- it excludes deaths associated with prescription fentanyl, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That brings the number down from 22,598 to 17,536 or even lower -- and is the difference between Schimel&rsquo;s claim being on or off target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly the CDC prefers the lower number and emphasizes it in its public presentation, but the higher figure, or<a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/overdose_data_1999-2015.xls\"> both</a>, are cited by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schimel said that in America, &quot;more people die from&quot; prescription narcotic painkillers &quot;than from heroin and cocaine combined.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His claim would go unchallenged if this were 2008, the year upon which his claim is based. But changing drug trends and a 2016 alteration in how federal officials tally deaths creates problems for his math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, there&rsquo;s a case to be made for his number based on a long-used but recently de-emphasized way of calculating deaths from prescription drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Half True.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-13T11:37:00.722662", "ruling_date": "2017-04-19T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Which is deadlier: prescription painkillers, heroin or cocaine?", "ruling_headline_slug": "which-deadlier-prescription-painkillers-heroin-or-", "ruling_link_text": "Outdated stats missed heroin surge", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Attorney General Brad Schimel, <a href=\"http://www.wearegreenbay.com/news/newsmaker-sunday/newsmaker-sunday-brad-schimel/659305298\">appearance</a> on WFRV-TV Green Bay, March 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from John P.
