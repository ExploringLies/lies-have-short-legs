Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., cautioned that Trump&rsquo;s anti-press rhetoric, such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/832708293516632065?lang=en\">calling</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, CNN and ABC News an &quot;enemy of the American people,&quot; serves to embolden repressive governments around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press,&quot; &nbsp;Flake said, &quot;but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flake then ticked off several examples where foreign leaders deployed the phrase &quot;fake news&quot; to foster distrust of the media. Based on our review of the evidence, it&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude that Trump&rsquo;s disparagement of the media has been replicated abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Invoking &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; to deny atrocities, human rights abuses</div>\r\n\r\n<p>An aide to Flake said the senator had referred to a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/08/trump-fake-news-despots-287129\">Politico</a> article that identified more than 15 instances where foreign leaders invoked the phrase &quot;fake news.&quot; Here&rsquo;s a sample:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in February <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-defiant-assad-tells-yahoo-news-torture-report-is-fake-news-100042667.html?soc_src=social-sh&amp;soc_trk=tw\">invoked &quot;fake news&quot;</a> to dismiss an Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/08/syria-torture-prisons/\">report</a> that up to 13,000 prisoners had been executed in one of his military prisons, saying the allegations were a reminder that &quot;we are living in a fake news era.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A security official in Buddhist-majority Myanmar in December used the term &quot;fake news&quot; to deny the very existence of the Rohingya people, a persecuted Muslim minority who are being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-ethnic-cleansing.html\">ethnically cleansed</a>, according to the United Nations. &quot;There is no such thing as Rohingya,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-denial-history.html\">the Myanmar official said</a>. &quot;It is fake news.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Venezuela&#39;s President Nicolas Maduro in July said it was &quot;fake news&quot; that a constitutional crisis was playing out in Venezuela against a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/venezuela\">backdrop</a> of widespread protests, human rights abuses and long-standing economic privation. &quot;The media spreads lots of false versions, lots of lies. This is what we call &#39;fake news&#39; today, isn&#39;t it?&quot; <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/latam/201707271055924853-maduro-media-fake-news/\">he told Russian broadcaster RT</a>, which the U.S. government considers a Kremlin propaganda outlet.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>An <a href=\"http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0531/c90000-9222361.html\">op-ed</a> with the headline &quot;Trump is right, fake news is the enemy, something China has known for years&quot; ran in May in the People&rsquo;s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party in China, which is perennially a leading jailer of journalists.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in October said he had been &quot;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs/philippines-duterte-says-hes-been-demonized-over-drugs-war-idUSKBN1CU1QY\">demonized</a>&quot; through &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2017/10/25/duterte-ejk-claim-ive-been-demonized-through-fake-news-571302\">fake news</a>&quot; coverage of his brutal drug war, which has seen an unprecedented scale of extrajudicial killings, according to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/philippines\">Human Rights Watch</a>. At a joint press appearance in Manila in November, with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/11/14/trump-chuckled-as-duterte-called-journalists-spies-thats-no-laughing-matter-in-the-philippines/?utm_term=.7d85145417e0\">Trump laughing at his side</a>, Duterte called journalists &quot;spies.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump&rsquo;s rebranding of &lsquo;fake news&rsquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s reason to think Trump inspired these responses. He has helped to popularize the phrase &quot;fake news,&quot; while shifting its meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/17/media/president-trump-fake-news-count/index.html\">CNN</a>, Trump has used the word &quot;fake&quot; more than 400 times since his inauguration, including&nbsp;&quot;fake news&quot; and its variants. Overall, use of the phrase &quot;fake news&quot; across all forms of media increased 365 percent from November 2016 to November 2017, according to the <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/woty\">Collins Dictionary</a>, which named &quot;fake news&quot; its 2017 word of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At PolitiFact, we have used the term &quot;fake news&quot; to refer to fabricated content masquerading as a portrayal of actual events, naming it our 2016 Lie of the Year after made-up stories dominated social media during the presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, however, uses &quot;fake news&quot; to dismiss coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration, or as a criticism against entire news organizations. He&rsquo;s also taken credit for rebranding the term &quot;fake news&quot; to apply to fact-based journalism, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVQPVGPAUtc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8m48s\">calling it</a> &quot;one of the greatest of all terms I&#39;ve come up with.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The epithet&rsquo;s authoritarian appeal</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts said it&rsquo;s easy to see why Trump&rsquo;s use of the term &quot;fake news&quot; appeals to authoritarian leaders. Authoritarian governments are typified by highly centralized power and the predominance of the state over individual rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every authoritarian needs to spread his own version of reality, and will invest time and resources to discredit anyone else&#39;s,&quot; said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University. &quot;Many of them are corrupt, and if an investigation threatens to compromise their authority, or charges of wrongdoing come down, they need the public to believe only what they say.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben-Ghiat said Trump&rsquo;s consistent efforts to attack the press as purveyors of bias and lies against him, and incite hostility toward individual news outlets and journalists, can be seen as part of a larger campaign against sectors of society that value evidence and investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When Trump says &lsquo;I am the only one who matters&rsquo; it is not just self-glorification, but a message about whose version of the facts should count in America,&quot; she said. &quot;How can foreign rulers not feel empowered by this?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A First Amendment advocate we spoke to drew parallels between Trump&rsquo;s use of the term &quot;fake news&quot; and George Orwell&rsquo;s dystopian novel <em>1984</em>, in which an authoritarian state inverts language to mean the opposite of its literal definition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is a characteristic of authoritarian leaders, whether Communist or Nazi, to appropriate ordinary words and declare them to mean the opposite,&quot; Bruce Johnson, a Seattle-based media lawyer, told PolitiFact. &quot;Repressive regimes hold power by depriving their population of independent thinking and making the masses believe lies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting we found no mentions of &quot;fake news&quot; from foreign leaders before 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Increased risk to journalists</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The rise of the &quot;fake news&quot; epithet coincided with one of the most dangerous years for journalists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists found 262 journalists were jailed for their work, a historic high for the second year in a row. In 21 cases, journalists were jailed under &quot;false news&quot; statutes, more than double the number in 2016, and in more countries, said Courtney Radsch, advocacy director at Committee to Protect Journalists. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s created an environment where it&rsquo;s more permissive for governments to jail journalists on false news charges,&quot; she said. &quot;They certainly don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to face many repercussions or condemnation from the United States when you have the president making those comments on a regular basis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human rights activists say the growing disregard for facts has been making their job harder, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Political leaders around the world have begun to deploy the label &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; as a smear on fact-finding by journalists, human rights organizations, perhaps even prosecutors,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/06/why-fake-news-word-year-bad-human-rights\">wrote</a> Iain Levine of Human Rights Watch. &quot;In doing so, they seek to break the link between evidence and culpability, making it more difficult to ensure those accountable pay for their misdeeds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Flake said that Trump&#39;s use of the term &quot;fake news&quot; to undermine journalism seems to have &quot;inspired dictators and authoritarians.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump popularized the phrase &quot;fake news&quot; over the past two years as a way to dismiss news coverage that is unsympathetic to him and his administration, even when the reporting is accurate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are more than a dozen recent instances where foreign leaders, including dictators and authoritarians, have similarly invoked &quot;fake news&quot; to dismiss allegations against them, including widespread extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. We found no mentions of &quot;fake news&quot; from foreign leaders before 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expanded use of the epithet has also emboldened authoritarian governments to jail more journalists under &quot;false news&quot; statutes, experts said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flake has solid examples from around the world to back up his statement, and there&rsquo;s strong correlation here given the timeline.
