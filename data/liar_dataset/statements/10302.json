It quickly became one of our most popular items of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while those statements were more opinion than fact, Grothman has also <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/glenn-grothman/\">taken his turn</a> on our Truth-O-Meter. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/25/glenn-grothman/gop-wisconsin-state-senator-says-study-shows-kids-/\">He earned a True</a>, for example, for saying a study showed that children who lived with a biological parent and the parent&rsquo;s partner were 20 times more likely to be sexually abused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 30, 2014, the congressman-elect made another statement that made us stop and say, &quot;Really?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/grothman-ill-be-constructive-conservative/29981786\">In an interview</a> on &quot;Upfront with Mike Gousha,&quot; a statewide public affairs show on WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Grothman said welfare reform would be one of his priorities in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saying the first step is to educate people about benefits, he declared:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year in total benefits between the healthcare and the earned income credit and the FoodShare and the low-income housing and what-have-you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman went on to say that amount is a &quot;bribe not to work that hard or a bribe not to marry somebody with a full-time job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered how easy it is for a single parent in Wisconsin to get $35,000 a year in state and federal benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grothman&rsquo;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman based his claim on a <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/grothman+lfb+paper+9-28-12+(2).1+(1).pdf\">September 2012 memo</a> from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is a well-respected nonpartisan scorekeeper of state budget matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s important to note this memo responded to a specific request Grothman made in his capacity as a state senator, rather than something the bureau produced on its own. Lawmakers often make requests of the bureau, but the way they tailor their requests can limit the bureau&#39;s analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the memo was titled: &quot;Value of (state and federal) public assistance and student financial aid benefits and tax credits available to two hypothetical families.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both hypothetical families rented a three-bedroom apartment in West Bend (the Milwaukee suburb where Grothman then lived), had two children -- ages 3 and 7 -- and had no health insurance through an employer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference was that one hypothetical family was a single parent working part-time, earning $10,000 per year, and going to technical college full-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other example was a married couple. One parent worked full-time and the other worked part-time while attending technical college full-time. They earned $50,000 per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Washington Post Fact Checker checked Grothman&rsquo;s claim, it said Grothman based his $35,000 figure on what the memo estimated the single parent could potentially receive in two categories: public assistance and tax benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, more than $29,000 in public assistance -- &nbsp;including child care subsidies, rent assistance and food stamps -- and more than $5,000 in tax credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we spoke to Grothman, he cited different tallies from the memo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to public assistance and tax benefits, the memo also did calculations in two more categories: student aid for the parent attending technical college and BadgerCare health care benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grand totals for all four categories of benefits were vastly different. Roughly $47,000 for the single mother (again, public assistance being the largest category). And roughly $8,000 for the married couple (from student aid and health benefits, no public assistance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the difference between the two grand totals is about $39,000, Grothman said he claimed $35,000 just to give himself a &quot;cushion.&quot; And he said the intent of his claim was to highlight what he called the &quot;marriage penalty&quot; -- lower benefits for a married couple versus a single parent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of how Grothman explained the figure to the Fact Checker and to us, either way, there are problems with his characterization of the $35,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Understanding the figure </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Fact Checker pointed out: &quot;It&rsquo;s easy to pick and choose what would make up a person&rsquo;s &lsquo;welfare package,&rsquo; and tack a number to it. This is essentially what Grothman did&quot; in requesting the memo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fact Checker <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/05/grothman-single-parents-welfare/\">gave Grothman</a> &quot;two Pinocchios,&quot; the second-lowest of their <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/#pinocchio\">five ratings</a>, for a claim that contains &quot;significant omissions and/or exaggerations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman argued to us that his examples weren&rsquo;t cherry picked -- that a single parent with two children is common, and so are the vast majority of benefits the single parent could receive, including child care, health care and food stamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in its memo, the fiscal bureau was careful to say &quot;no data exist on the number of households that may actually be receiving the combination of tax and program benefits&quot; listed for the hypothetical families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memo added:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Although the number of families who would qualify for all of the benefits described in this memorandum is unknown, it is likely to be quite small relative to the state&rsquo;s overall population.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One other point: Grothman made his claim in the context of reducing &quot;welfare&quot; benefits. But while some of the assistance he cites, such as food stamps, might commonly be considered to be welfare, other benefits -- including tax credits and student aid -- are not. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman said: &quot;A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year&quot; in public assistance in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one level, Grothman is using a common example in terms of a single parent with two children, but his use of the word &quot;easily&quot; goes too far. The very analysis he cites as evidence concludes that only a small &nbsp;percentage of Wisconsin residents would qualify for all of the various child care subsidies, housing aid, food stamps and tax benefits that Grothman cites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-glenn-grothman-claim-that-its-easy-to-get-35000-a-year-in-welfare-b99407791z1-285643911.html?ipad=y\">website</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-12-11T13:43:07.422552", "ruling_date": "2014-12-12T13:47:30", "ruling_headline": "Can a single parent in Wisconsin easily get $35,000 per year in government benefits?", "ruling_headline_slug": "can-single-mother-wisconsin-easily-get-35000-year-", "ruling_link_text": "Maybe  for a small group.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WISN-TV, <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/grothman-ill-be-constructive-conservative/29981786\">video</a> of &quot;Upfront with Mike Gousha&quot; interview of U.S. Rep.-elect Glenn Grothman (quote at 5:50), Nov. 30, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, U.S. Rep.-elect Glenn Grothman, Dec. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Glenn Grothman campaign communications director Andy Post, Dec. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post Fact Checker, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/05/grothman-single-parents-welfare/\">&quot;Do &lsquo;welfare&rsquo; recipients get $35,000 in benefits a year?&quot;</a> Dec. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/grothman+lfb+paper+9-28-12+(2).1+(1).pdf\">memo</a> to state Sen.
