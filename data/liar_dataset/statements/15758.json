It says that Redskins players knelt during the national anthem, angering the police officers providing security at the game. The cops decided to stage a counter-protest: they got down on one knee, yelled &quot;blue lives matter&quot; and then left the team in the locker room. Unable to get past the angry fans outside, the players were stuck all night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Universaleinfo article was flagged as part Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Since then,<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/09/24/donald-trump-nfl-player-protests-national-anthem-week-3-response/697609001/\"> over 200 players </a>throughout the league have chosen to kneel or sit in protest. Protests spiked in September 2017, when President Donald Trump encouraged NFL owners to fire players who didn&rsquo;t stand for the anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days after Trump spoke against Kaepernick, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/majority-of-raiders-sit-during-anthem-most-redskins-players-stand-and-link-arms/\">some Redskins players knelt</a> before their game. Since then, there have been no reports of Redskins players refusing to stand during the anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Universaleinfo article was posted on Aug. 5, 2018. It says that the Redskins knelt before their game on &quot;Monday night&quot; in Philadelphia. Aug. 5 was a Sunday, so previous Monday would have been six days before, on July 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Redskins did not play a game on July 30. In fact, they <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/schedules/2018/PRE/REDSKINS\">hadn&rsquo;t even started pre-season yet.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article also said that the Philadelphia Police Department released a statement after the incident, but there were no recent press releases about the Redskins online. A spokesperson for the Redskins confirmed that there was no game on July 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as we can tell, this article was entirely fabricated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The origin</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Where did this article come from, if not any actual news sites?
