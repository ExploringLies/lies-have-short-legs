We were curious about whether those numbers were accurate and why the gap was so large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government health-care program for the very poor. Nolan&rsquo;s commentary referenced the 2013 &quot;Rhode Island Annual Medicaid Expenditure Report,&quot; developed by the state&#39;s office of Health and Human Services. We located <a href=\"http://www.ohhs.ri.gov/documents/documents13_3rdQ/Medicaid_Exp_Report_June_2013.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the report</u></a>, but we couldn&#39;t find any numbers that matched Nolan&rsquo;s. So we emailed her to make sure that was really her source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She replied that the information actually came from a June 1, 2014, report by Providence College sociologist Eric Hirsch, in which he identified 5,986 Rhode Islanders who had spent at least one night in an emergency shelter over a 28-month period and discovered that 2,308 were covered by Medicaid. Their Medicaid expenses totaled $58 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hirsch doesn&#39;t calculate the cost per person, so we did. It&#39;s $10,795 per person per year. That&#39;s pretty close to the average for all Medicaid recipients and a far cry from $60,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where did Nolan get her $60,000 figure?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his report, Hirsch wanted to make the point that those costs were not evenly distributed among the homeless. &quot;In fact,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the 67 individuals who were homeless for one year or more and had the highest Medicaid bills had total charges of $9,325,375.&quot; That&#39;s $139,185 per person for these 67 people&quot; over 28 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The corresponding annual charge was just under $60,000 per person,&quot; Hirsch wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we immediately noticed a problem -- $60,000 isn&#39;t the average for <em>all</em> long-term homeless people. It&#39;s only for the 67 people who racked up the <em>highest</em> Medicaid bills, a distinction Nolan didn&#39;t make in her commentary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Hirsch, he explained that, &quot;We do want to be able to argue that it would be most cost effective to house the most vulnerable.&quot; In other words, finding housing for &#39;high cost&#39; homeless are going to save the most money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said he used an arbitrary cutoff -- expenses of $47,000 or more -- to identify the high-cost users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Nolan was talking about all long-term homeless on Medicaid -- not just the 67 with the highest bills -- &nbsp;we asked Hirsh for the information on the larger group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He went back to his data and reported to us that there were 442 long-term homeless people who had, on average, $23,650 in Medicaid charges per person per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although that&#39;s double the amount for the typical person who was homeless for at least one night, it&#39;s dramatically less than $60,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we wrote back to Nolan asking if she was aware that the $60,000 figure only applied to homeless Medicaid patients with the biggest bills, she said she had misinterpreted the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, for the record, Hirsch and Nolan erred when they said the average Medicaid cost is $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults. As Hirsch reported when we questioned the figure based on the state Medicaid report, the correct amount is $21,696.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anne Nolan said Rhode Islanders who have been homeless for at least a year cost Medicaid an average of $60,000 per person per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the $60,000 cost she cites applied only to the 67 homeless people with the highest medical bills, a major caveat she didn&#39;t mention in her commentary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual dollar amount for all Medicaid recipients in the study who were homeless for at least a year was $23,650 -- a substantial cost to taxpayers, but far less than what Nolan indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Nolan&#39;s statement makes it sound like it applies to all long-term homeless people on Medicaid when, in fact, it only focuses on the most-expensive subset, we rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
