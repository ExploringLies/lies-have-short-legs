States were mandated to either create their own exchanges or participate in one from the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 3.6 million people in New York state have enrolled in a health plan through the state exchange since it began, <a href=\"https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/news/press-release-ny-state-health-announces-nearly-1-5-new-yorkers-get-their-health-coverage\">according to</a> the state Department of Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is Schneiderman right that the uninsured rate in New York has been cut in half since the exchange began?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Data on uninsured New Yorkers </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Centers for Disease Control <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201306.pdf\">data</a>, 10.6 percent of New York state&rsquo;s population did not have health insurance in&nbsp;2012, the year before the state health exchange was established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2015, the uninsured rate was 4.9 percent, but it increased to 5.4 percent in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201705.pdf\">2016</a>&nbsp;- still about half the rate before the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Explaining the decrease</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does Obama&#39;s Affordable Care Act deserve the credit? Experts we spoke to said the rate dropped because the state health exchange gave people an easier way to compare health plans online, and premiums dropped 53 percent the first year of the exchange. Average premiums have since increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s really just been an incredible boom for New York state, the Affordable Care Act,&quot; said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Serve Society of New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state also opted into an option in Obamacare that provides low-cost health insurance to people who make too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy insurance.&nbsp;More than 665,000 state residents have enrolled in the plan since it first became available in 2015, Benjamin said. New York and Minnesota are the only two states with this option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state also expanded the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility. That allowed some people to get coverage through Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneiderman said &quot;we have been able to cut New York&rsquo;s uninsured rate in half since 2013 from 10 percent to 5 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right on the numbers. The uninsured rate in 2013 was 9.6 percent. The latest data shows it at 5.4 percent in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim as True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-13T09:14:18.093220", "ruling_date": "2017-07-24T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Since Obamacare, far fewer New Yorkers are uninsured", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-has-obamacare-lowered-new-yorks-uninsured-rate", "ruling_link_text": "We spoke to experts", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M9S7N_GNgE\">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman speaks at Mount Sinai</a> on July 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/abny-schneiderman-makes-clear-if-health-care-bill-becomes-law-i-will-challenge-it\">Transcript of Schneiderman&rsquo;s speech at the Association for a Better New York&rsquo;s Power Breakfast</a>, June 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Amy Spitalnick, spokesperson for Schneiderman</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone conversation with Amy Shefrin, program officer at the New York State Health Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone conversation with Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Serve Society of New York</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with press staff from the Centers for Disease Control</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data on Uninsured Population from the Centers for Disease Control: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201306.pdf\">2012</a> | <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201406.pdf\">2013</a> | <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201506.pdf\">2014</a> | <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201605.pdf\">2015</a> | <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201705.pdf\">2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/health/health-plan-cost-for-new-yorkers-set-to-fall-50.html\">Health Plan Cost for New Yorkers Set to Fall 50%</a>&quot;, July 16, 2013, New York Times</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://nypost.com/2017/05/15/state-insurers-to-seek-rate-hike-for-2018-obamacare-policies/\">State insurers to seek rate hike for 2018 ObamaCare policies</a>&quot;, May 15, 2017, New York Post</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/EssentialPlan\">Information on the Essential Plan from NY State of Health</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/news/press-release-ny-state-health-announces-nearly-1-5-new-yorkers-get-their-health-coverage\">Enrollment data from NY State of Health</a>, May 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "State Attorney General", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Eric", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "New York", "id": 3998, "last_name": "Schneiderman", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "eric-schneiderman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Schneiderman_Thumbnail.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3998/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 3, "website": "https://ag.ny.gov/about-attorney-general"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We have been able to cut New York&rsquo;s uninsured rate in half since 2013 from 10 percent to 5 percent of our population.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine", "statement_date": "2017-07-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
