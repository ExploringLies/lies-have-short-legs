Charlie Crist has portrayed Gov. Rick Scott as taking a chainsaw to the state&rsquo;s education budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist, now a Democrat, spoke about education funding in an interview with MSNBC&rsquo;s Chuck Todd on Nov. 5, 2013, the day after he announced that he would challenge the Republican governor. (Crist was a Republican governor in 2007 but left the party while running for his failed U.S. Senate bid in 2010.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First thing he does when he comes in, Chuck, is cut education by $1.3 billion,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/the-daily-rundown/watch/crist-billing-himself-as-peoples-governor-61398083661\">Crist said</a>. &quot;That&rsquo;s an incredible decrease. Then in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott and his backers have touted <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/may/01/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-every-florida-teacher-gets-pay-rai/\">teacher pay raises</a> that Scott pushed this year, while the Democrats have attacked him for cuts. In this fact-check we will explain if Scott cut education by $1.3 billion in his first year in office in 2011 and then in the second year cut $300 million from state universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>K-12 budget </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Scott approached his first legislative session in 2011, he unveiled a budget proposal at a tea party rally that included steep spending cuts, including to education. Ultimately, the Republican-led Legislature backed some of those cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple news articles described the cuts to K-12 education at more than $1 billion -- and many articles used that $1.3 billion figure cited by Crist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Senate budget subcommittee conference report during the 2011 session shows a <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/UserContent/Session/2011/Appropriations/Senate/offers/BEA/Offer_04292011_1300.pdf\">cut of about $1.35 billion</a>. But not all of that cut was as a result of reduced state funding -- the largest chunk of the decline was due to the fact that the two years of federal stimulus funds had expired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009-10 and 2010-11, the state received federal stimulus dollars. (Crist was the governor when the state accepted the stimulus.) When the state got the stimulus, it reduced the state&rsquo;s contribution by the same amount. When the stimulus funds expired, Scott and the Legislature chose not to fully reinstate the state dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Education Finance Program, the main source of dollars for K-12 education, is by law a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars called the &quot;required local effort&quot; -- and the state dictates the amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, the state cut its own contribution to education funding by about $200 million, but it also reduced the local contribution by $572 million. Add in the lost federal stimulus money of $870 million, and we get $1.6 billion in funding reductions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, there were other things happening that reduced funding for schools, said Ruth Melton, legislative director for the Florida School Boards Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this same time period most school districts lost the authority to levy local discretionary millage (a loss of about $200 million) and had to serve an additional 25,000 students (an additional cost of about $155 million).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the plus side of the ledger, the state did get more federal aid apart from the stimulus, of about $555 million through a program known as Education Jobs Fund Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In short, I can make a very strong case that the cut between 2010-11 and 2011-12 was more than $2 billion, but I can also find my way to agreeing that the cut was about $1.4 billion,&quot; Melton said. &quot;Whatever the case, it seems that the bottom line is that the state could have increased state and local funding levels to cover, at a minimum, the loss of the (stimulus) funds, but chose not to do so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The education cuts aren&rsquo;t on Scott&rsquo;s plate alone, but he was one of the main driver&rsquo;s behind them. Scott proposed <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/feb/08/rick-scott/education-cuts-show-rick-scotts-budget/\">even steeper cuts</a> to education, and in the end he signed off on the budget crafted by the Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By December 2011, Scott did a major about-face and called for a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-hes-adding-1-billion-new-education/\">$1 billion boost to education</a>, though that did not fully cover the previous cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will not sign a budget that does not significantly increase state funding for education,&quot; Scott said at a news conference in the Capitol, the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> reported. &quot;We&#39;ve got to really focus on education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an eye toward his 2014 re-election campaign, Scott has touted education funding increases. The Department of Education&rsquo;s powerpoint shows funding hit a recent low of $16.6 billion in 2010-11. But then, over the next two years, it rose to $18.3 billion in 2013-14. But that&rsquo;s still lower than the pre-recession level -- in 2007-08 the total was $18.7 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Scott&rsquo;s victories in the most recent session was persuading the Legislature to agree to his plan for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/may/01/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-every-florida-teacher-gets-pay-rai/\"> $480 million in teacher raises</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott&rsquo;s spokesman also cited a 2013 report by the <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/files/9-12-13sfp.pdf\">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> that said Florida had the second-largest per pupil increase in education spending for the 2013-14 budget year, only behind Oregon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But despite that increase, the report also showed that Florida was among the majority of the states where funding per student remained lower than 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Higher education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist specified cuts to the state&rsquo;s universities, not state colleges and community colleges, so we will focus this part of our fact-check on state funding for universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State appropriations for universities dropped by $303.7 million between 2011 and 2012, according to the Florida Board of Governors. Lawmakers assumed that universities would dip into reserves and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/aug/02/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-increased-tuition-our-state-colleges-an/\">increase tuition</a> up to 15 percent to cover the shortfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, lawmakers approved restoring the $300 million, and schools received additional money for particular projects. That means the <a href=\"http://flbog.edu/about/_doc/budget/budgetrequest/20132014/SUSAppropriationSummaryDetail.pdf\">total state appropriations</a> (general revenue plus education enhancements) grew by about $519 million between 2012-13 and 2013-14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the first time in seven years, our universities did not see their budgets cut,&quot; wrote Frank Brogan, chancellor of the State University System, in an op-ed in the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em>. &quot;This is a welcome change that we hope signals the state&#39;s long-term re-investment in higher education, particularly following years in which students have shouldered more and more of the costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would the Legislature slash $300 million only to restore it -- and then some -- the next year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Legislature looked at universities&rsquo; reserves and found they had more than $1 billion, well above the legal requirement of about $250 million, said Tim Jones, chief financial officer for the Board of Governors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the Legislature essentially told universities that the state was going to cut $300 million to balance the budget, and universities could use reserves to cover the loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan was that it would be a one-year cut and they&rsquo;d get their money back the following year if the state budget outlook was brighter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Universities know that every year kind of stands alone,&quot; Jones said. &quot;If the (state&rsquo;s) budget had been bad, they could have said, &lsquo;Sorry, we can&rsquo;t restore it this year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist said that Gov. Rick Scott &quot;cut education by $1.3 billion&quot; in his first year and then &quot;in his second year he decreases funding by $300 million to our state universities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are various ways to add up the total cuts in K-12. Crist uses the $1.3 billion figure that includes the cut in state and state-required local dollars, but the largest chunk was due to the expiration of the stimulus funds. The state also cut $300 million from universities during Scott&rsquo;s second legislative session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that much of K-12 education funding was restored, though it&rsquo;s still below pre-recession levels. And the Legislature restored the cut to universities the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line, though, is that Crist chose his words carefully, and those cuts did happen during the years he mentioned. We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-08T12:17:18.315560", "ruling_date": "2013-11-11T10:33:10", "ruling_headline": "Charlie Crist says Rick Scott cut K-12 by $1.3 billion in his first year and higher ed by $300 million in his second", "ruling_headline_slug": "charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-cut-k-12-13-billion-", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but money was also restored", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>MSNBC Daily Rundown, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/the-daily-rundown/watch/crist-billing-himself-as-peoples-governor-61398083661\">&quot;Crist bills himself as &lsquo;People&rsquo;s Governor,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Nov. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/files/9-12-13sfp.pdf\">&quot;Most states funding schools less than before the recession,&quot;</a> Sept. 12, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Department of Education, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/816261-fefp-funding-history.html\">&quot;Florida Education Finance Program,&quot;</a> 2007-08 through legislative budget request 2014-15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Senate, <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/UserContent/Session/2011/Appropriations/Senate/offers/BEA/Offer_04292011_1300.pdf\">Conference committee on Senate budget subcommittee on education pre-K-12 appropriations</a>, April 29, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Board of Governors, <a href=\"http://flbog.edu/about/_doc/budget/budgetrequest/20132014/SUSAppropriationSummaryDetail.pdf\">Conference summary allocation by appropriation</a>, 2013-14</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Board of Governors, <a href=\"http://flbog.edu/about/budget/legappropriations.php\">Legislative Appropriations</a>, 2006-07 through 2013-14</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/aug/02/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-increased-tuition-our-state-colleges-an/\">&quot;Rick Scott &lsquo;increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double-digits,&rsquo; Florida Democratic Party says,&quot; </a>Aug. 2, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/may/01/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-every-florida-teacher-gets-pay-rai/\">&quot;Rick Scott says &lsquo;every Florida teacher gets a pay raise&rsquo; with new budget,&rsquo;&quot;</a> April 29, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-hes-adding-1-billion-new-education/\">&quot;Rick Scott says he is adding $1 billion in &lsquo;new&rsquo; education funding,&quot; </a>Jan. 10, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/feb/08/rick-scott/education-cuts-show-rick-scotts-budget/\">Education cuts show up in Rick Scott&#39;s budget</a>, Feb. 8, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;New priority: schools,&quot; Accessed in Nexis, Dec. 8, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/k12/scotts-budget-boosts-schools-hits-hospitals/1205257\">Scott&#39;s budget boosts schools, hits hospitals</a>, Dec. 8, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;Budget softens blows to USF,&quot; Accessed in Nexis, March 6, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Kim Wilmath, spokeswoman for Florida Board of Governors, Nov. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Ruth Melton, legislative director, Florida School Boards Association, Nov. 6,2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Tim Jones, chief financial officer Florida Board of Governors, Nov. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, John Tupps, spokesman for Gov.
