But, even as she celebrated her victory, Hassan was asked to address the matter one more time last week, this time before a national audience.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviewing Hassan the morning after the election on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/shows/the-daily-rundown/\">MSNBC&rsquo;s Daily Rundown</a>, anchor Chuck Todd asked the newly elected governor about the prospects of a broad-based tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I served in the state Senate for six years with retiring Gov. John Lynch. During that time, we had the fourth lowest unemployment rate in the country,&quot; Hassan told Todd during the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-daily-rundown/49728063/#49728063\">November 7 interview</a>. &quot;Our economy works really well without an income or a sales tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThroughout campaign season and beyond, candidates commonly refer to New Hampshire&rsquo;s unemployment rate as one of the country&rsquo;s lowest. But, was it really fourth best in the country during Hassan&rsquo;s time in office? We decided to check the books.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal counts show that the numbers fluctuated slightly during Hassan&rsquo;s time in the Senate. She she served three terms between 2004-10 before running for governor this year. Amid the changes, New Hampshire&rsquo;s rate remained among the lowest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s a year-by-year review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lastrk05.htm\">2005</a>: 3.6 percent unemployment, tied with Montana for fourth lowest.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lastrk06.htm\">2006</a>: 3.5 percent, tied with Alabama, Delaware for seventh lowest.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lastrk07.htm\">2007</a>: 3.5 percent, tied with Delaware, New Mexico for eighth lowest.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lastrk08.htm\">2008</a>: 3.9 percent, sixth lowest<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lastrk09.htm\">2009</a>: 6.2 percent, tied with Iowa for fifth lowest<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lastrk10.htm\">2010</a>: 6.1 percent, fourth lowest<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(As a side note, New Hampshire retained its spot as the fourth-lowest unemployment rate, 5.4 percent, in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/lastrk11.htm\">2011</a>, the year after Hassan left office.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the numbers show Hassan&rsquo;s claim to be in the ballpark. The state&rsquo;s unemployment rate ranked fourth lowest in both her first year in office and her last, and even when it rose, it remained among the country&rsquo;s lowest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, Hassan cited the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate as evidence the state doesn&rsquo;t need an income or sales tax. For purposes of this check, we wanted to look at the connection between taxes and unemployment rates to see if there&rsquo;s a link as Hassan suggests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnalysts say there&rsquo;s no direct correlation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAcross the country, tax policy may contribute to a strong jobs environment, but a variety of other, more local factors likely weigh heavier in determining the unemployment rate, according to Scott Drenkard, an economist with the business-backed <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/\">Tax Foundation</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;New Hampshire fits with the pattern of having low unemployment and having a good tax system, but there are lots of contributing factors,&quot; Drenkard said. &quot;I can&#39;t say there&#39;s a very robust correlation (with the tax structure).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the other states that rank among the lowest unemployment rates, for instance, Idaho, Vermont and Virginia all have both income and sales taxes. Hawaii, which had the nation&rsquo;s lowest unemployment rate, had the nation&rsquo;s highest income tax rate in 2005 and 2006, Hassan&rsquo;s first two years in office, according to the Tax Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn New Hampshire, factors such as the state&rsquo;s small population, its lack of big population centers and its demographics -- older and educated -- contribute heavily to its strong employment, according to Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;For an older population, they&#39;re more likely to have jobs and hold on to jobs than the younger population is,&quot; Delay said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurther, New Hampshire features strong manufacturing and health care sectors, among others, that keep employment strong, even in economic downturns, said Annette Nielsen, an economist for the state Employment Security office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s a whole mix of things. We have fairly strong high-tech manufacturing, and that combined with not a huge population, it doesn&rsquo;t take a whole lot to create (good employment numbers),&quot; Nielsen said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPut more succinctly, &quot;There&rsquo;s no real connection between unemployment and tax structure,&quot; said Jon Shure, director of state fiscal strategies at the national Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. &quot;The key thing to creating jobs in any state is to make sure that you&#39;re investing in infrastructure, transportation, health care, all the components of a strong economy. &hellip; It&rsquo;s not necessarily taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Hampshire&rsquo;s unemployment rate fluctuated a little through Hassan&rsquo;s tenure. But, even as it reached No. 7 among states in 2006 and No. 8 in 2007, New Hampshire&rsquo;s rate remained among the country&rsquo;s lowest. And, by the time Hassan left office in 2010, New Hampshire&rsquo;s rate had returned to fourth, where it stood in her first year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll give the new governor credit for getting her numbers right (mostly). But, her stated connection between the unemployment rate and New Hampshire&rsquo;s tax structure doesn&rsquo;t hold up. Analysts in New Hampshire and around the country suggest that other factors -- &nbsp;including states&rsquo; size, demographics and work base -- drive unemployment more than taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-16T17:08:50.876789", "ruling_date": "2012-11-16T17:06:38", "ruling_headline": "New Hampshire's new governor Maggie Hassan claims link between low unemployment and taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "new-hampshires-new-governor-maggie-hassan-claims-l", "ruling_link_text": "Close on the numbers, wrong on the link", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMSNBC: The Daily Rundown,<a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-daily-rundown/49728063/#49728063\">Girl power in New Hampshire</a>, November 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Marc Goldberg, spokesman for N.H.
