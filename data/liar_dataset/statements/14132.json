Ten percent of the people in the individual market in Wisconsin were in the state high-risk pool. They had eight or nine plans to choose from. They could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted. And their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ll check Ryan&rsquo;s three-part claim, which <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs7Jh542gqc\">he repeated</a> on the Fox News Channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s essentially on target on the first two parts, but not on the third.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s a high-risk pool?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation helps explain the rationale for creating <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/\">high-risk pools</a>: the sickest 10 percent of the population accounts for nearly two-thirds of all health spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/issue-brief/2014/dec/1792_hall_highrisk_pools.pdf\">questions remain</a> about the effectiveness of <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/\">high-risk pools</a> and whether there would be enough public dollars allocated to them under the GOP bill to make insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool &quot;was a lifesaver&quot; for those it served, Kaiser health reform and private insurance senior fellow <a href=\"http://kff.org/person/karen-pollitz/\">Karen Pollitz</a> told us. But it served only some of the people who were eligible, and for it to be viable nationally, &quot;you would have to put down a whole lot of money, more than has been put in the House bill so far,&quot; she said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool -- the Wisconsin Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan -- <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/business/new-health-care-law-spells-end-to-states-high-risk-insurance-program-b9986769z1-221958321.html\">operated</a> from 1979 through 2013. <a href=\"https://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/15-7full.pdf\">It was funded</a> through policyholder premiums, reduced payments to health care providers and financial assessments on health insurance companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end, it insured <a href=\"https://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/15-7full.pdf\">21,000 people</a> and was regarded as among the most successful programs in the country, even though not everyone with preexisting conditions who needed coverage could afford it. Also, Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool did not contain the same coverages as Obamacare plans -- for example, it had a lifetime limit for benefits, whereas Obamacare does not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, understanding the limited nature of Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool, we go to the three parts of Ryan&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ryan&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan was close on the number of plans available in Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool. There were <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2013/0053_health_insurance_risk_sharing_plan_informational_paper_53.pdf\">seven options</a> (not eight or nine) in place with deductibles ranging from $1,000 to $7,500, although one was only for Medicare recipients seeking supplemental coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan also was close on provider availability. All hospitals and doctors who were Medicaid-certified could be used by high-risk pool recipients. That included all hospitals in the state and the vast majority of doctors, said <a href=\"https://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/about/staff/austin-sam.htm\">Sam Austin</a>, a health policy analyst at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Population Health Institute and the author of a 2013 Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2013/0053_health_insurance_risk_sharing_plan_informational_paper_53.pdf\">report</a> on the state&rsquo;s high-risk pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Ryan&rsquo;s staff pointed out that Wisconsin&rsquo;s deputy insurance commissioner <a href=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20170202/105506/HHRG-115-IF14-Wstate-WieskeJ-20170202.pdf\">has told Congress</a> that people in the high-risk pool had to pay more for coverage under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it can&rsquo;t be flatly stated that all premiums and co-payments in the high-risk pool were lower than those under Obamacare, Austin and other experts told us. As we noted, under options available in the high-risk pool and under Obamacare, premiums, deductibles, coverages and subsidies all vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser&rsquo;s Pollitz told us that if medical inflation were taken into account, the Wisconsin high-risk pool costs would generally be higher than the current Obamacare rates. And high-risk pools expert <a href=\"http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/hpm/faculty-and-staff/faculty/jean-hall.html\">Jean Hall</a>, a Kansas University health policy professor, told us that low-income people who qualify for subsidies under Obamacare are getting more coverage for less money than they were with Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool -- even if there were cases where people with higher incomes got a better deal with the pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan says that before Obamacare, Wisconsin&rsquo;s high-risk pool for health insurance &quot;had eight or nine&quot; plans to choose from, people &quot;could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House speaker slightly overstates the number of plans and the availability of providers, but is generally on target. But it can&rsquo;t be flatly stated that the high-risk pool plans were cheaper than Obamacare plans for comparable coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Ryan a Half True.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-18T14:50:00.501242", "ruling_date": "2017-05-19T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Paul Ryan's claim on Wisconsin being a model for covering people with preexisting conditions", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-ryans-claim-wisconsin-being-model-covering-pe", "ruling_link_text": "Largely correct on plans and providers, not so much on Obamacare comparison", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-2017-speaker-paul-ryan-sen-susan/story?id=47246455\">video</a> of &quot;This Week&quot; Paul Ryan interview, May 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/\">&quot;Does the GOP&#39;s new health care bill still cover pre-existing conditions, as Trump claims?&quot;</a> May 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/\">&quot;PolitiFact&rsquo;s guide to the GOP amendment to health care bill,&quot;</a> April 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/may/05/whats-house-health-care-bill/\">&quot;What&rsquo;s in the House health care bill?&quot;</a> May 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact North Carolina,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/\"> &quot;Does new version of the AHCA protect coverage for pre-existing conditions?&quot;</a> May 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/high-risk-pools-for-uninsurable-individuals/\">&quot;High-Risk Pools For Uninsurable Individuals,&quot;</a> Feb. 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Kaiser Family Foundation health reform and private insurance senior fellow <a href=\"http://kff.org/person/karen-pollitz/\">Karen Pollitz</a>, May 15, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation,<a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/perspective/high-risk-pools-as-fallback-for-high-cost-patients-require-new-rules/\"> &quot;High-Risk Pools as Fallback for High-Cost Patients Require New Rules,&quot;</a> Jan. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin State Journal, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/health-med-fit/obamacare-repeal-could-involve-high-risk-pools-like-wisconsin-s/article_1537eb53-3cc0-58a4-967b-ea5110722bd7.html\">&quot;Obamacare repeal could involve high-risk pools like Wisconsin&#39;s,&quot;</a> Feb. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2013/0053_health_insurance_risk_sharing_plan_informational_paper_53.pdf\">&quot;Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan,&quot;</a> January, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bureau,<a href=\"https://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/15-7full.pdf\"> &quot;Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan,&quot;</a> June 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Wisconsin+Health+Insurance+Risk-Sharing+Plan&amp;oq=Wisconsin+Health+Insurance+Risk-Sharing+Plan&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60.288j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Wisconsin+Health+Insurance+Risk-Sharing+Plan&amp;start=20\">testimony</a> of Wisconsin deputy insurance commissioner J.P.
