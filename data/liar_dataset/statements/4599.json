The first-term county executive is arguing that his budget cuts are justified because the sheriff&rsquo;s office plays only a limited role in what he calls traditional law enforcement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s certainly true that the Milwaukee County sheriff&rsquo;s office has less responsibility for crime fighting than sheriff&rsquo;s departments in less urban parts of Wisconsin, given that Milwaukee County is filled with cities and villages that have their own police departments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means under <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf\">FBI </a><a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf\">rules</a> the vast majority of crimes in Milwaukee County are reported by local agencies and not the sheriff&rsquo;s office, said Tami Jackson, spokesman for the state Office of Justice Assistance, which coordinates FBI reporting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe sheriff&rsquo;s office also differs from local police departments in that it runs two jails, provides bailiffs for the courthouse and provides other inmate-related services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, under Abele&rsquo;s budget, nearly three-fourths of the 1,146 sheriff&rsquo;s employees would work in what is known as the detention division, while less than 20 percent would perform what are called police services: crime investigation, patrol and providing security for the airport, parks and County Grounds. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it is clear the sheriff&rsquo;s office has less responsibility for crime fighting than other police agencies. But by running jails and patrolling freeways, among other duties, it is providing other essential law enforcement services. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Sheriff reported few crimes to FBI:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his claim about crimes reported to the FBI, Abele was citing the FBI&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_08_dd.html\">Uniform Crime </a><a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_08_dd.html\">Reporting</a> figures for 2009, said his spokesman, Jeff Bentoff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose major crime statistics are released annually by the FBI and are tracked regularly by news media such as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which maintains a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/dataondemand/33663609.html\">searchable </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/dataondemand/33663609.html\">database</a> of UCR data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThrough UCR, local law enforcement agencies report to the FBI four types of violent crime (murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) and four types of property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the statistic Abele is citing covers only a limited portion of offenses that local law enforcement authorities handle and only the most serious ones.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found Abele accurately quoted the total number of UCR crimes reported to the FBI in 2009 by Milwaukee police (<a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_08_wi.html\">more than 41,000</a>); West Allis police (<a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_08_wi.html\">more than 3,200</a>); and UWM police (<a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_09_wi.html\">242</a>-- five violent and 237 property crimes).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele was off a bit when he said the sheriff&rsquo;s office reported 12 crimes to the FBI in 2009. The sheriff&rsquo;s office actually reported seven violent crimes plus 12 property crimes for a <a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_10_wi.html\">total of </a><a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_10_wi.html\">19</a> UCR crimes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Abele gave the wrong figure in his budget speech, he quoted the correct figure in other budget documents. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Bentoff said Abele cited 2009 UCR statistics because they were the most recent available when Abele&rsquo;s budget was assembled. We found 2010 figures and they show a similar disproportion -- the sheriff&rsquo;s department reported <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/table-10/10tbl10wi.xls\">38</a> UCR crimes to the FBI in 2010, far fewer than the <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/table-9/10tbl09wi.xls\">271</a> reported by UWM police.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Abele was correct in claiming that the sheriff&rsquo;s office reported far fewer crimes to the FBI in 2009 than UWM police did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is that the whole picture in terms of crime fighting? Was the sheriff&rsquo;s office involved in handling only 19 serious crimes in all of 2009?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Clarke spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin about Abele&rsquo;s statement, she did not rebut his statistic. Rather, she argued that Abele &quot;cherry picked&quot; a figure that she said doesn&rsquo;t reflect the many non-UCR offenses handled by the sheriff&rsquo;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcLaughlin provided summaries that show the sheriff&rsquo;s office made 1,927 arrests in 2009. Relatively few were for serious crimes. A sampling: One arrest was for murder, one was for second-degree sexual assault and 15 were for battery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, more than 1,000 of the sheriff&rsquo;s arrests were for operating while intoxicated. In Wisconsin, OWI doesn&rsquo;t become a crime until the second offense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe sheriff&rsquo;s office also recorded 290 arrests for disorderly conduct, which can be a municipal offense or a misdemeanor crime.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, while the sheriff&rsquo;s office does handle some serious crimes, most of its traditional police work involves lesser offenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele said the sheriff&rsquo;s office &quot;plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency&quot; and in 2009 reported far fewer crimes to the FBI than UWM police did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele&rsquo;s claim about the FBI reporting was accurate and it reflects the fact that the sheriff&rsquo;s office handles relatively few major crimes. On the other hand, the sheriff&rsquo;s office runs jails, patrols freeways and provides other services that other police agencies rely on and that are essential components of traditional law enforcement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Abele&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-13T11:09:20.881990", "ruling_date": "2011-10-17T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Milwaukee County executve says sheriff's office plays \"limited role\" in law enforcement, reports few major crimes", "ruling_headline_slug": "milwaukee-county-executve-says-sheriffs-office-pla", "ruling_link_text": "Bigger role;
