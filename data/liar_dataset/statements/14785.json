A Southwest Airlines spokesman, Dan Landson, confirmed that it is a scam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phony website promotes a deal that promises that viewers have been &quot;selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Southwest Airlines Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon completion of the survey participants get a message: &quot;Congratulations! You won 2 Free tickets at Southwest Airlines!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But don&rsquo;t expect those tickets to ever arrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A good rule of thumb is that if something sounds too good to be true, it generally is,&quot; Landson told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Landson pointed to a few signs that this is fake news: the airline&rsquo;s official website is Southwest.com while this website is sout-west.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The date written as &quot;27. November 2017&quot; is also not a format that Southwest uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And, we never just give out free tickets,&quot; Landson said. Landson said Southwest is in its 47th year, not its 50th.&nbsp;(Landson originally said the airline had celebrated its 48th birthday, which is incorrect.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s been some type of scam like this floating around for several years. (We found an example of the scam reported in the <em>Miami Herald</em> in 2011). A <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/02/09/southwest-airlines-flight-giveaway-scam-facebook/\">similar previous version</a> offered travelers free first-class tickets to a &quot;dream destination&quot; and $5,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graham Cluley, a security analyst, wrote about the<a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/02/09/southwest-airlines-flight-giveaway-scam-facebook/\"> repercussions of such a scam</a> in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions &ndash; whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company&rsquo;s real website to see if they mention the competition there &ndash; or whether they are warning of a scam.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumers can get actual information about Southwest at 1-800-I-FLY-SWA or Southwest.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the headline that states &quot;Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!&quot; is a scam. Similar versions have circulated for years. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-27T14:55:41.808058", "ruling_date": "2017-11-27T15:17:26", "ruling_headline": "Offer for free tickets from Southwest Airlines is a scam", "ruling_headline_slug": "offer-free-tickets-southwest-airlines-scam", "ruling_link_text": "A scam for years", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Soutwest-air.com, <a href=\"http://www.soutwest-air.com/\">&quot;Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!&quot;</a> Nov. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welivesecurity.com,<a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/02/09/southwest-airlines-flight-giveaway-scam-facebook/\"> &quot;Southwest Airlines flight giveaway scams spread on Facebook,&quot;</a> Feb. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/southwest.asp\">&quot;Free Southwest Tickets Scam,&quot; </a>April 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, &quot;Free Southwest offer is flight of scammer fancy,&quot; (Accessed in Nexis) Nov. 14, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Dan Landson, Southwest Airlines spokesman, Nov. 27, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4113, "last_name": "soutwest-air.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "soutwest-aircom", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4113/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://soutwest-air.com"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2017-11-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
