They check out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the months of July 2017-July 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\">reported</a> a gain of 327,000 jobs in manufacturing, just as the CNBC article said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at the previous July-to-July gains or losses in manufacturing jobs going back to 1994-95 and found that the 2018 performance was easily the best during that period. Here are the results:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>We also confirmed that from April 1994 to April 1995, the economy gained 345,000 manufacturing jobs. The intervening periods -- May 1994 to May 1995, and June 1994 to June 1994 -- both fell short of 345,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll note that manufacturing jobs are only slowly recovering the ground they have lost since the 1980s, and especially after the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009.

The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, &quot;Thanks to President Trump and Republicans over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995, when the figure added a healthy 345,000 positions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers and the length of time are accurate.
