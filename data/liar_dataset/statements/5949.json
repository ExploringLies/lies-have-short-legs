On the third anniversary of its passage, Romney issued a news release titled, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/news/press/2012/02/three-years-later-obamas-stimulus-still-failing\">Three Years Later, Obama&#39;s Stimulus is Still Failing</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats contend Romney has flip-flopped on it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos -- a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUOM9QvhG5I&amp;feature=player_embedded\">30-second version</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">four-minute version</a> -- that claimed he had flipped on several issues, including the stimulus:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tOn-screen text: &quot;Opposed the stimulus.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tVideo clip of Romney: &quot;I have never supported the president&#39;s Recovery Act, alright -- the stimulus. No time, nowhere, nohow.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tOn-screen text: &quot;After he was for it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tDifferent video clip of Romney: &quot;I think there is need for economic stimulus.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked the DNC for citations for these clips when the ad was released, they responded that the first (&quot;I have never supported ...&quot;) was from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05NqZ8cBcI&amp;feature=related\">a town hall</a> at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Sept. 28, 2011, and the second (&quot;I think there is a need ...&quot;) from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttn8dnWBQ0Q\">a Romney appearance </a>on CNN&rsquo;s <em>Late Edition </em>with Wolf Blitzer on Jan. 4, 2009.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWe noticed that the CNN interview -- when Romney said, &quot;I think there is need for economic stimulus&quot; -- took place before Obama had been sworn into office and therefore before there was much detail about it.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www-cgi.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0901/04/le.01.html\">transcript</a> indicated Romney was talking in general terms.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tBlitzer said that Obama, then president-elect, was &quot;talking about a $750 billion economic stimulus package. He wants it to be passed as soon as possible. It&#39;s unclear if whether it can be passed before he&#39;s inaugurated on January 20th. What do you think about this proposal?&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tRomney replied, &quot;Well, I frankly wish that the last Congress (had) dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they&#39;ll be doing, and that&#39;s net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that&#39;s one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tHe continued, &quot;I&#39;d move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We&#39;ll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies. But let&#39;s not make this a Christmas tree of all of the favors for various politicians who have helped out the Obama campaign, giving them special projects. That would be wrong. You&#39;ll see Republicans fight that tooth and nail if that happens. Let&#39;s do what&#39;s right for the economy, and let&#39;s not do what&#39;s a political expedient move.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s misleading to say that Romney flip-flopped on supporting &quot;the president&#39;s Recovery Act.&quot; At the time of the CNN interview, no Obama stimulus bill had been introduced, much less enacted. With such complex bills, the devil&rsquo;s in the details.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut before Obama took office, Romney had spoken in favor of a stimulus -- particularly if the stimulus in question had been passed when a Republican was in the White House.
