Facebook users flagged the article as being potentially fake, as part of the social media platform&rsquo;s efforts to curb fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is pure fiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheMiamiGazette.com calls itself &quot;an entertainment and satire web publication&quot; in its <a href=\"http://themiamigazette.com/disclaimer/\">Disclaimer section</a>. The disclaimer also stated, &quot;All news articles contained within The Miami Gazette are fictional and presumably satirical news.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This disclaimer is buried, appearing only in a special page in the footer part of the website. Someone surfing the Miami Gazette will hardly notice the caution about the website being fictional, and the article adopts the style of news websites to give the impression of real news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its <a href=\"http://themiamigazette.com/contact-us/\">Contact Us</a> page TheMiamiGazette.com provides only an email address with a Gmail account.

But there is neither a photo nor contact information for Anthony Brooks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to providing real-sounding names of the suspects, the article was illustrated with images of a cluttered basement captioned with &quot;courtesy of Vernal Heights Police Department&quot; and cited &quot;Vernal Heights Chief of Police Gregory Moore.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The supposed picture of Vernal Heights Police Chief Gregory Moore <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/troy-anderson-man-speaker-fire-1579478/\">traces back</a> to the free photo download website, Pixabay.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pixabay also was used for the <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/tools-tool-wall-workshop-old-1755603/\">photo of the &quot;&lsquo;tool wall&rsquo;</a> that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims&quot; &nbsp;as it states in the fake article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A photo used in the article that purportedly showed &quot;a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals&quot;&nbsp;traced back to <a href=\"https://www.tineye.com/search/929a967996308ff0de111630f7f41a9e1fd35804/\">41 different results</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the suspects, we had difficulty tracking down who the men truly were, although one of them was a Georgia man named <a href=\"http://georgia.arrests.org/Arrests/Markey_Caldwell_17247395/\">Markey Caldwell</a>, who was arrested in 2014 for criminal trespassing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no place in Florida with the name <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Vernal+Heights&amp;oq=Vernal+Heights&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i59j0l3.1301j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Vernal Heights</a> at all, and no reports of cannibals caught eating flesh to cure diabetes and depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would be big news, if true.
