Based on our analysis of these three documents, as well as our discussions with independent budget experts, we found many policies now advocated by Obama had been included in the bipartisan commission&rsquo;s final report. However, in many cases the White House proposals either differed in some of the details or lacked details entirely.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&#39;s an abbreviated version of what we found.
