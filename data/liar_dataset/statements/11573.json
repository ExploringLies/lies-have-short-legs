Clinton said she would not raise taxes on the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have made very clear that hard-working, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase,&quot; she said, adding that &quot;wages adjusted for inflation haven&rsquo;t risen since the turn of the last century.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To check her assertion about stagnant wages, we turned to figures collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To take advantage of the most recent available data, we looked at figures for the third quarter of 2015. And to design the fairest comparison, we looked at third-quarter data for two different years -- 1999 and 2000 -- that could be used to describe the baseline &quot;since the turn of the last century.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To adhere to Clinton&rsquo;s parameters, the figures below are all inflation-adjusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Period</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, inflation-adjusted</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/history/wkyeng_10211999.txt\">Third quarter, 1999</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$315</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/history/wkyeng_10192000.txt\">Third quarter, 2000</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$321</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/wkyeng_10202015.pdf\">Third quarter, 2015</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$340</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This shows that wages didn&rsquo;t rise very much above inflation over that period, though they did rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, they rose about 8 percent between 1999 and 2015, and about 6 percent between 2000 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not very much of a rise over a 15-to 16-year period, as Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out when PolitiFact contacted the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, it does undercut Clinton&rsquo;s wording in the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that this pattern didn&rsquo;t simply start in 2000 -- it goes back to the 1970s and even the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Pew Research Center noted, using similar BLS data, &quot;For most U.S. workers, real wages &mdash; that is, after inflation is taken into account &mdash; have been flat or even falling for decades, regardless of whether the economy has been adding or subtracting jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, Pew wrote, &quot;in seasonally adjusted current dollars, median usual weekly earnings rose from $232 in the first quarter of 1979 (when the series began) to $782 in the second quarter of (2014, the most recent data available). But in (inflation-adjusted) terms, the median has barely budged over that period.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper added that what gains have been made over that period have accrued to the upper-income brackets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since 2000, usual weekly wages have fallen 3.7 percent (in real terms) among workers in the lowest tenth of the earnings distribution, and 3 percent among the lowest quarter,&quot; Pew wrote. &quot;But among people near the top of the distribution, real wages have risen 9.7 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that &quot;wages adjusted for inflation haven&rsquo;t risen since the turn of the last century.&quot; They didn&rsquo;t rise by much -- roughly half a percentage point per year above inflation over the past decade and a half -- but they did rise.
