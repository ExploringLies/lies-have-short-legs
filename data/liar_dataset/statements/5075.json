Bob McDonnell has proposed spending an additional $2.2 billion on state employee and teacher pensions during a two-year budget period that will begin July 1.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor, in presenting his biennial budget plan to the General Assembly&rsquo;s money committees on Dec. 19, <a href=\"http://www.governor.virginia.gov/utility/docs/Address%20to%20the%20Joint%20Money%20Committees%20December%2019,%202011.pdf\">said</a>&nbsp;his pension proposal, if approved, would be &quot;the largest employer contribution to the Virginia Retirement System in history.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered whether the total $2.21 billion infusion over two budget years would truly be historic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince taking office in 2010, McDonnell has made a number of proposals to reform the Virginia Retirement System, which is an estimated $19.9 billion short of the assets needed to pay its projected pension liabilities over the next 85 years. But the governor also added to VRS&rsquo;s woes early in his term by convincing the legislature to divert $620 million in scheduled pension contributions to balance the state&rsquo;s general fund, which pays for education, public safety and health programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder McDonnell&rsquo;s new proposal, Virginia would pay roughly $600 million for state employee pensions during the 2013-14 budget years. Another $1.6 billion would be contributed to teacher retirement funds, with local governments picking up $1 billion of the sum and the state government paying $600 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTucker Martin, McDonnell&rsquo;s director of communications, told us the governor&rsquo;s claim that the $2.21 billion total contributions would be historic was based on VRS data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe VRS figures show the largest employer contribution to date came in the 2007-08 biennial budget when total state and local contributions were $1.72 billion. That&rsquo;s lower than McDonnell&rsquo;s proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe retirement system started in 1942, but VRS doesn&rsquo;t have records of employer contributions before 1973.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJeanne Chenault, a VRS spokeswoman, said the number of teachers and state employees before 1973 would have been lower, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that contribution amounts would have exceeded 1973 levels.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe VRS data shows annual contribution amounts without adjusting for inflation. So we did that work ourselves to see McDonnell&rsquo;s claim could survive another test.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt did. Even when adjusting for inflation, the 2007-08 contributions were still the high-water mark for employer contributions to the pension system, coming in at just more than $1.8 billion in current dollars. McDonnell&rsquo;s proposal eclipses that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our Ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor said his proposed $2.21 billion employer contribution for state worker and teacher pensions would be the largest in VRS history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor as far back as the data goes, the governor&rsquo;s statement is correct even when adjusting for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-06T16:04:46.687951", "ruling_date": "2012-01-06T15:57:42", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
