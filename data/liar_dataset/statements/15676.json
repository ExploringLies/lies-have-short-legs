In recent weeks, one of the accomplishments he&rsquo;s been trumpeting is his standing with Republican voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a July 29 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1023534604148518912?s=09\">tweet</a>, Trump wrote, &quot;Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;d said something similar. On July 10, he said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1016638035281219584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1016638035281219584&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fnews%2F396800-trump-says-recent-poll-shows-hes-more-popular-than-lincoln\">tweet</a>, &quot;New Poll says Trump, at over 90%, is the most popular Republican in history of the Party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And three days later, in an <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6766644/donald-trump-feels-unwelcome-london-protests/\">interview</a> with the British newspaper The Sun, Trump said, &quot;You know, a poll just came out that I am the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party. Beating Lincoln. I beat our Honest Abe.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has reason to crow about his popularity among Republicans: His approval rating within his own party has ranged from 84 percent to 90 percent since mid April 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ratings for approval among Republicans &quot;are moving in a narrow range,&quot; said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;They are very high and pretty stable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the media has taken note. Around Trump&rsquo;s 500th day in office on June 4, there were a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/gop-wants-trump-in-2020-more-popular-than-obama-jfk-reagan\">flurry</a> of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5847999/Donald-Trump-popular-Republicans-president-Second-World-War.html\">articles</a> that noted how Trump&rsquo;s approval ratings at that point in their tenure were higher than those of most previous Republican presidents, at least among respondents in their own party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, the Daily Mail cited Gallup &mdash; the longest-running source for presidential approval ratings &ndash; to report that Republicans&rsquo; support for Trump, then at 87 percent, was higher on his 500th day than any post-war president except for George W. Bush, who was at 96 percent with Republicans after the 9/11 attacks. (For that matter, no Democrat had a higher rating with Democrats than Trump did with Republicans.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the way Trump phrased his tweet was problematic. One concern involves polling at the time of Honest Abe &mdash; to be precise, the lack thereof. The other involves higher approval ratings of recent Republican presidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">There were no scientific opinion polls in Lincoln&rsquo;s day</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Unscientific straw polls date to at least 1824, with &quot;informal trial heat tallies&quot; &quot;taken in scattered taverns, militia offices, and public meetings,&quot; D. Sunshine Hillygus, a Duke University political scientist, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/75/5/962/1830219\">has written</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the polls of Lincoln&rsquo;s time are not considered scientific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of scientific polling came into its own after a disastrous 1936 poll by Literary Digest, a popular magazine. The magazine&rsquo;s poll was based on responses from millions of Americans, but the data it gathered had a significantly different demographic balance than the electorate as a whole. This lack of scientific rigor led the poll to incorrectly call the 1936 presidential election, opening the door to survey methods championed by George Gallup and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallup <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/22/george-will/george-will-says-democrats-1930s-wanted-fdr-be-mor/\">began polling in 1935</a> using a method that&#39;s different from today&#39;s but rigorous for its time. Early polls by Gallup determined the demographic makeup of the electorate, then assigned survey-takers to visit far-flung locales in order to personally interview respondents with certain demographic characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, reputable pollsters use a better system: random sampling to choose phone numbers from across the country, which they then call to ask standardized, carefully worded questions. The assumption is that a truly random sample will reproduce the whole nation in microcosm to within a few percentage points of accuracy (the familiar &quot;margin of error&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern polling has its critics, and the industry has had to adapt its methods to account for factors such as the growing use of cell phones. One newer type of poll is based on online &quot;panels&quot; of voters designed to mirror the demographics of the electorate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its imperfections, scientific polling remains the best tool available. And Lincoln never faced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump&rsquo;s standing among Republicans is high, but not highest all-time</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the only Republican presidents for whom scientific polling data exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent publicly available data from Gallup&rsquo;s weekly tracking poll at the time of Trump&rsquo;s tweet <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">showed him with</a> 85 percent approval from Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does that 85 percent rating compare with his Republican predecessors? We looked at <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/interactives/185273/r.aspx?g_source=WWWV7HP&amp;g_medium=topic&amp;g_campaign=tiles\">Gallup historical data</a> for Republican presidents going back to Eisenhower. We looked for the closest polling data for July&nbsp;29 of their second year in office (the day of Trump&rsquo;s claim).
