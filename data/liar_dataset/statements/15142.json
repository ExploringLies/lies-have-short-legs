Andrew M. Cuomo wants state lawmakers to pass a bill he believes would prevent more women from being murdered by people close to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill would remove guns from people convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Guns are currently only taken away if someone has a felony conviction for domestic violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners,&quot; Cuomo said at a March 13 rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill is part of Cuomo&rsquo;s 2018 Women&rsquo;s Agenda, a list of more than two dozen proposals concerning healthcare, equal pay and gun violence among other issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The domestic violence bill doubles as one of the governor&rsquo;s proposals to add to the state&rsquo;s gun control laws. New York state already has one of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/feb/01/brian-kavanagh/rate-gun-caused-deaths-ny-among-lowest-country/\">lowest</a> rates of gun-caused death in the country, but Cuomo believes the proposal could drive that number lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is he right that half of women murdered in the U.S. are killed by their intimate partners?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo&rsquo;s claim comes from data <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6628a1.htm\">released</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency looked at the homicides of 10,018 adult women in 18&nbsp;states from 2003 to 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The circumstances of the homicide were&nbsp;known in 8,028 of the cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those, 4,442 homicides, or 55.3 percent, were related to intimate partner violence. The report defines an intimate partner as a current, former, or unspecified spouse or romantic partner. Women killed while intervening in an incident of intimate partner violence, like a friend or family member, were also counted in this category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost 80 percent of intimate partner homicides involved a current intimate partner. &nbsp;About 11 percent of victims had experienced violence&nbsp;in the month preceding their death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An argument preceded the victim&rsquo;s death in about a third of intimate partner homicides, the report found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gun-involved homicides</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report does not include data on the criminal history of the suspects. It&rsquo;s not known what share had a history of domestic violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the agency did collect information on the type of weapon used in each homicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A firearm was used in 5,234 of the total homicides, or almost 54 percent. That&rsquo;s more than double the number of victims killed with a sharp instrument, the next most-documented weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors of the report suggest legislation like Cuomo&rsquo;s could help prevent more female homicides in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;State statutes limiting access to firearms for persons under a domestic violence restraining order can serve as another preventive measure associated with reduced risk for intimate partner homicide and firearm intimate partner homicide,&quot; the report said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvv.pdf\">report</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found an estimated 45 percent of female homicide victims were killed by an intimate partner in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New York state data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbers in New York state mirror national data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 48 percent of female domestic homicides in New York state involved an intimate partner in 2016, according to <a href=\"http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/2016-Domestic-Homicide-Report.pdf\">a report</a> from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. A firearm was used in about a third of all domestic homicides in New York state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state data does not include homicides where there was no known relationship between the suspect and victim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo said &quot;Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data collected by the CDC supports Cuomo&rsquo;s claim. More than half of the female homicides the agency studied involved an intimate partner when the relationship was known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-15T11:16:24.299332", "ruling_date": "2018-03-16T10:44:20", "ruling_headline": "Half of female homicides in the U.S. involve an intimate partner", "ruling_headline_slug": "half-female-homicides-us-involve-intimate-partner", "ruling_link_text": "Both in U.S. and N.Y.", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email conversation with Richard Azzopardi, spokesperson for Cuomo</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-unveils-2018-womens-agenda-new-york-equal-rights-equal-opportunity\">Cuomo&rsquo;s 2018 Women&rsquo;s Agenda</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6628a1.htm\">Racial and Ethnic Differences in Homicides of Adult Women and the Role of Intimate Partner Violence &mdash; United States, 2003&ndash;2014</a>,&quot; Centers for Disease Control, July 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/2016-Domestic-Homicide-Report.pdf\">Domestic Homicide in New York State 2016</a>,&quot; New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvv.pdf\">Female Victims of Violence</a>,&quot; U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, September 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-unveils-2018-womens-agenda-new-york-equal-rights-equal-opportunity\">Gov.
