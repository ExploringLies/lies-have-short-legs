In fact, in his official tax proposal, Romney has advocated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-gives-mill/\">across-the-board tax cuts</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut has he been consistent over the years about putting his commitment not to raise taxes in the form of a pledge?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe question about Romney and the tax pledge was raised in late 2007, when the Democratic National Committee released a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUOM9QvhG5I&amp;feature=player_embedded\">30-second</a> ad and a <a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">four-minute</a> video charging, among other things, that Romney had changed his position on signing a no-tax pledge.

It&rsquo;s simply gauging whether they did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Romney and the 2002 gubernatorial campaign</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring his 2002 campaign for governor of Massachusetts, Romney said he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how the <em>Boston Globe </em>covered the news:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a &lsquo;no new taxes&rsquo; pledge,&quot; the newspaper wrote. &quot;Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article went on to quote Romney saying, &quot;I am not in favor of increasing taxes. &hellip; At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that&#39;s true on this and other issues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Globe </em>cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the <em>Union-News </em>of Springfield, Mass. &quot;I&#39;m against tax increases,&quot; Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the <em>Union-News</em>. &quot;But I&#39;m not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney&#39;s refusal to sign, which came after he&rsquo;d met with her for half an hour. &quot;He&#39;s thinking like an independent businessman who doesn&#39;t sign pledges,&quot; she suggested to the <em>Globe</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the <em>Boston Herald </em>quoted Eric Fehrnstrom, then Romney&rsquo;s deputy campaign manager, saying, &quot;Mitt Romney doesn&#39;t have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He&#39;s pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn&#39;t support them, his position on taxes is clear.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview with the <em>Globe</em>, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge &quot;government by gimmickry,&quot; the newspaper reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPut it all together and you have a candidate who didn&rsquo;t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Romney&rsquo;s decision on a pledge in late 2006</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate in the 2008 presidential election to sign a prominent taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, an influential anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense,&quot; Norquist said in a <a href=\"http://www.atr.org/mitt-romney-signs-taxpayer-protection-pledge-a1872\">news release</a>. &quot;Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=95745#axzz1f82C1yku\">press release</a> touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=96235#axzz1f81tfAVd\">radio ad</a> spotlighting it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases,&quot; Romney said in the ad. &quot;I&#39;m Mitt Romney. I&#39;m proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We&#39;ve got to get taxes down and grow our economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Massachusetts text was a &quot;pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to &quot;oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses &hellip; and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2002, Romney refused to make &quot;a pledge in writing&quot; on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that&rsquo;s a Full Flop.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-16T16:00:58.484061", "ruling_date": "2012-05-17T16:51:18", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney rejected state tax pledge before signing national one", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-rejected-state-tax-pledge-signing-nati", "ruling_link_text": "Rejected a state pledge; later signed a national one", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic National Committee, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">Mitt v.
