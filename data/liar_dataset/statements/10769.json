STAY ALIVE.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put in context, that&rsquo;s more than three deaths every day, by the 113th day of the year. The implication of the sign suggests that driver behavior is contributing to those fatalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But considering PolitiFact Georgia just fact-checked road fatalities in January, showing highway deaths appeared to be declining, could that trend already be reversing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And does driver behavior have anything to do with the trend?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes and yes, according to Terri Pope, spokeswoman for the Northeast DOT region, when asked about the signs and numbers behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far in 2015, traffic deaths are up 25 percent from last year, Pope said. The state is averaging 100 deaths a month on its roadways, putting it on track for 1,200 fatalities by year&rsquo;s end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that happens, it will be a 4.6 percent increase from 2014 numbers &ndash; and the first year-to-year increase in nine years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even worse, of the year&rsquo;s roadway deaths so far, only 38 percent of drivers were wearing seat belts and 69 percent failed to maintain their lane &ndash; behaviors that experts say save lives behind the wheel, Pope said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, 60 percent of the fatalities were single-car crashes where the vehicle hit a tree, culvert or bridge or drifted into another lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Those statistics show that drivers, now more than ever, are driving distracted or are driving impaired,&quot; Pope wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the number of roadway deaths in Georgia is definitely on the rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But has distracted driving &ndash; such as the use of a cell phone &ndash; also increased as a contributing factor in those crashes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state DOT does not have 2015 data with that information, since local law enforcement agencies would determine causes as part of investigations that will lag behind the actual accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the type of accidents &ndash; those single-car crashes into fixed objects or failing to maintain the lane &ndash; indicate the driver was distracted by <em>something.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Governor&rsquo;s Office of Highway Safety provided PolitiFact Georgia with statistics on distracted driving from 2009 to 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data, with last year&rsquo;s numbers still considered preliminary are:</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse;

safer cars, stepped up enforcement of drunken driving and roadway enhancements &ndash; are likely to have allowed for more injuries in crashes, said Harris Blackwood, director of the highway safety office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But still, the number of people injured in distracted driving crashes jumped 181 percent in the five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Driver error is a major factor in a lot of these crashes that have happened and in these increased fatal crashes,&quot;
