And he ended up becoming the nominee of the party,\" he said Wednesday, August 29, 2007, on CNN's\n <i>\n  The Situation Room.\n </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n We find it's not a fair comparison. Dodd is not only understating Kerry's strength in the polls, but overstating his own.\n</p>\n<p>\n First, his subtraction was off, which the Dodd campaign acknowledged in an e-mail to us last week.\r\nDodd was citing a Dec. 10-13, 2003, CBS/New York Times poll. It showed Kerry at 4 percent, behind Al Sharpton at 6 and Dean at 23 (The subtraction error was that Kerry was 19 percentage points behind Dean, not 22 points as Dodd said).\n</p>\n<p>\n Dodd chose to cite polls that showed Kerry at an especially low point &mdash; 4 percent. Indeed, there were four polls showing Kerry at that level.\n</p>\n<p>\n But other polls that same month showed Kerry with more support. There were other polls that had him between 5 and 8 percent, and two that had him at 10 percent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dodd's biggest stretch is his attempt to liken his poll standing to Kerry. In most polls conducted this year that include him, Dodd registers at 1 percent. He's topped out at 2 percent about five times. Even Carol Moseley Braun polled better in 2004.\n</p>\n<p>\n And anyway, does Dodd really want to be comparing himself to Kerry? Refresh our memory here, but didn't the senator from Massachusetts ultimately &mdash; what's that word again? &mdash; lose?\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:38.502713", "ruling_date": "2007-09-07T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cherry-picked numbers don't tell full story", "ruling_headline_slug": "cherry-picked-numbers-dont-tell-full-story", "ruling_link_text": "Cherry-picked numbers don't tell full story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "PollingReport.com,\n<a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/wh04dem.htm\">\n 2004 Democratic nomination\n</a>\n<p>\n PollingReport.com,\n <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/wh08dem.htm\">\n  2008 Democratic nomination\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n CBS News,\n <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/17/opinion/polls/main589167.shtml\">\n  Dodd's December 2003 poll\n </a>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Connecticut", "id": 3, "last_name": "Dodd", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "chris-dodd", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-chrisdodd.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.chrisdodd.com/"}, "statement": "\"John Kerry was at 4 percent in the polls in December of 2003...and he ended up becoming the nominee of the party.\"\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on CNN's <i>The Situation Room</i>", "statement_date": "2007-08-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
