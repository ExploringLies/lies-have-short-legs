And there are more uninsured children in Texas than in any other state,&quot; Sebelius wrote in a Dec. 15, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20131215-kathleen-sebelius-the-importance-of-health-care-navigators-to-texas.ece\"><u>opinion column</u></a> in the <em>Dallas Morning News</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the piece, which later appeared in the Dec. 18, 2013, <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, Sebelius said Texas could have helped many immediately by accepting the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s offer of federal dollars to help pay for expanding Medicaid. We recently rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/nov/08/barack-obama/more-million-texans-would-become-medicaid-eligible/\"><u>True</u></a> a claim from President Barack Obama that a million Texans could get insurance right away if the state agreed to the expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics have noted how few Texans have health insurance for decades, though in March 2013, PolitiFact Texas rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/mar/06/garnet-coleman/garnet-coleman-says-texas-has-highest-number-unins/\"><u>False</u></a> a claim by state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, that Texas had the most uninsured residents of any state at 6 million. In fact, California had about 1 million more uninsured residents in 2011. Then again, California&rsquo;s population then exceeded Texas&rsquo; by some 12 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rate of uninsured residents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you look at the percentage of uninsured residents instead of the raw numbers, Texas has the highest, as Sebelius said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing on U.S. Census Bureau research, the Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/\"><u>said</u></a> 24 percent of Texas residents in 2012 had no health insurance, followed by Nevada (23 percent) and Florida (21 percent.)

But despite having fewer residents than California, Texas had more uninsured children in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spokeswoman Emma Sandoe at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, part of the federal Health and Human Services Department, guided us to the 2012 Census <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/cpstables/032013/health/toc.htm\"><u>estimates of uninsured children</u></a> by state. Texas ranked first, with 1.1 million uninsured children, followed by California with 891,000; Florida with 528,000; and Georgia with 321,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebelius said, &quot;Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. ...
