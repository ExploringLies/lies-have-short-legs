But the Republican Legislature passed a bill that you said you can&#39;t. That bill&#39;s on Governor Walker&#39;s desk. I&#39;ve urged him to veto it.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe previously looked at a claim related to the same <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb202\">bill</a>. We gave a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/12/cory-mason/wisconsin-gop-bill-would-repeal-law-ensuring-pay-e/\">Mostly False</a> to state Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/cory-mason/\">Cory Mason</a>, D-Racine, for saying the bill would repeal a law that ensures men and women get equal pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalk&#39;s statement is slightly different.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe former Dane County executive claims that women would no longer have &quot;a right to do something&quot; about pay discrimination on the job if the bill is signed by Walker. (The measure won Walker&rsquo;s approval on April 5, 2012)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Falk&rsquo;s case</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked to back up the statement, Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross said the bill would take away the right of women who suffer pay discrimination to sue in state court, &quot;so there&#39;s nothing women can do.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut when we assessed the Mason claim, we found there would still be other recourse for employment discrimination victims:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-- There are two routes to filing an employment discrimination complaint -- the state Equal Rights Division and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-- If workers prove discrimination using the state system, an administrative law judge can &quot;make them whole&quot; by ordering the employer to pay back pay with interest, legal fees and job reinstatement, if there was a termination. If the discrimination is proved in the federal system, often a &quot;make whole&quot; settlement is reached through mediation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-- In either system, discriminated workers can collect larger sums of money from an employer -- compensatory and punitive damages -- only by suing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Options available</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo women suffering pay discrimination could still file a state or federal complaint in an effort to be made whole. And they could still seek larger monetary damages by suing in federal court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the option of suing in state court was instituted only recently, in 2009, under a law adopted when Democrats controlled the Legislature and governor&rsquo;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA lawyer who specializes in representing workers told us the GOP bill would make it harder on victims of employment discrimination because it is easier to sue in state court than in federal court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut eliminating the state lawsuit option wouldn&#39;t affect the three other avenues of legal recourse available to workplace discrimination victims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Falk&rsquo;s claim was women facing pay discrimination would have no options at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalk said women facing pay discrimination can&#39;t &quot;do something about it&quot; under a bill passed by Wisconsin Republicans. But of the four legal options available under the current law, only one would be eliminated by the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Falk&#39;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-05T17:22:13.886334", "ruling_date": "2012-04-10T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Dem in Wisconsin governor recall says GOP-backed bill means women \"can't do something about\" pay discrimination  ", "ruling_headline_slug": "dem-wisconsin-governor-recall-says-gop-backed-bill", "ruling_link_text": "One legal option goes away, three remain", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube.com, Kathleen Falk <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_kI8v6N3S8\">speech</a>, March 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross, April 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/12/cory-mason/wisconsin-gop-bill-would-repeal-law-ensuring-pay-e/\">&quot;Wisconsin GOP bill would repeal law ensuring pay equity for women, Dem lawmaker says,&quot;</a> March 12, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Kathleen", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 1574, "last_name": "Falk", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "kathleen-falk", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kathleen_Falk.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1574/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.kathleenfalk.net/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Wisconsin women facing pay discrimination can&#39;t &quot;do something about it&quot; under bill passed by Republicans.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2012-03-24", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 117, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/117/", "subject": "Civil Rights", "subject_slug": "civil-rights", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 146, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/146/", "subject": "Women", "subject_slug": "women", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1800, "last_name": "Wisconsin Legislature Republicans", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "wisconsin-legislature-republicans", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": null, "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1800/", "total_count": 0, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
