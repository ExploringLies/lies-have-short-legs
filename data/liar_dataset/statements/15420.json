Anthony List&rsquo;s Campaign for Life Gala, Trump claimed Democrats want open borders and don&rsquo;t want to stop illegal immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And the other day &mdash; just the other day &mdash; Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of MS-13,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-susan-b-anthony-list-11th-annual-campaign-life-gala/\">Trump said</a>. &quot;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that. She wants them to be treated with respect, as do other Democrats.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump repeated the charge against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on May 23 during a roundtable discussion on MS-13, saying: &quot;I noticed recently where Democrats, Nancy Pelosi as an example, are trying to defend MS-13 gang members. I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuke. They said, &lsquo;they are people.&rsquo; They are not people. These are animals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered about Trump&rsquo;s claim that Pelosi &quot;came out in favor of MS-13&quot; and that she has defended gang members. Trump distorted the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi said &quot;calling people animals is not a good thing,&quot; but did not focus her comments on MS-13 gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump&rsquo;s &lsquo;animals&rsquo; remark</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump made headlines earlier this month after labeling some people who come to the United States as &quot;animals.&quot; His comment came during an immigration meeting with California officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump did not specifically mention MS-13 gang members in the &quot;animals&quot; sentence, his statement came after a sheriff spoke about &quot;bad guys&quot; and MS-13 gang members.

They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as &lsquo;Animals,&rsquo; a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual!&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/997429518867591170\">Trump tweeted</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What Pelosi said</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi clearly chose the interpretation of Trump&rsquo;s words at the roundtable that was least favorable to Trump. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean she was embracing violent gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a May 17 press conference, the day after Trump&rsquo;s &quot;animals&quot; comment, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/05/17/nancy_pelosi_ms-13_gang_members_are_not_animals.html\">Pelosi said</a> &quot;calling people animals is not a good thing&quot; and defended &quot;undocumented immigrants.&quot; She did not mention MS-13 gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi said &quot;we&#39;re all God&#39;s children&quot; and spoke about &quot;a spark of divinity in every person on Earth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And so when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, &lsquo;These aren&#39;t people. These are animals,&rsquo; you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person? &lsquo;These are not people. These are animals.&rsquo; The president of the United States,&quot; Pelosi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement, &quot;Pelosi either is peddling an out-of-context quote that mainstream media outlets have corrected or retracted (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ap/statuses/997138543817449472\">AP</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN/status/997170505609302016\">CNN</a>), or defending MS-13 gang members whose motto is rape, control, and kill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House said the &quot;animals&quot; term is language <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/28/in-long-island-trump-to-highlight-violence-from-ms-13-gang-to-push-congress-on-immigration/?utm_term=.ad218677f6b3\">Trump has used before</a> when talking about MS-13 gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Pelosi did not defend MS-13 gang members or come out in their favor, as Trump claimed. She centered her comments on &quot;undocumented immigrants&quot; and rebuked using the word &quot;animals&quot; to refer to people.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Pelosi &quot;came out in favor of MS-13.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s claim is based on Pelosi&rsquo;s criticism of Trump for using the word &quot;animals&quot; during an immigration meeting with California officials. Trump used that term after a sheriff spoke about MS-13 gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A day after Trump&rsquo;s comment, Pelosi said &quot;calling people animals is not a good thing&quot; and defended &quot;undocumented immigrants.&quot; Pelosi did not mention MS-13 gang members in her comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump blasted media reports and others for missing the context of his remarks, he did just that with Pelosi&rsquo;s comment.
