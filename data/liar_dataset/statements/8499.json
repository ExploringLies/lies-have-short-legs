Some will like the Massachusetts approach, and some won&rsquo;t, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Massachusetts approach &quot;teaches some important lessons some states are not going to want to follow,&quot; Romney said. &quot;One lesson is health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country. Now, that&rsquo;s something that Texas and Minnesota and Montana are not going to necessarily want to adopt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it true that health insurance is &quot;more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of ways to measure the cost of what Romney termed &quot;health insurance.&quot; For answers, we turned to research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Here are a few of the categories that would seem to fit Romney&rsquo;s definition. (Note: None of the categories here include the District of Columbia.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employer-based health insurance for individuals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Employee share: <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/single-coverage/\"><u>Massachusetts ranks 1st</u></a> among all states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Employer share: <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/single-coverage/\"><u>Massachusetts ranks 10th</u></a> among all states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Combined employee and employer share: <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/single-coverage/\"><u>Massachusetts ranks 2nd</u></a> among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employer-based health insurance for families</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Employee share: <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/family-coverage/\"><u>Massachusetts ranks 11th</u></a> among all states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Employer share: <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/family-coverage/\"><u>Massachusetts ranks 5th</u></a> among all states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Combined employee and employer share: <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/family-coverage/\"><u>Massachusetts ranks 2nd</u></a> among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Individual-market insurance per person</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Monthly premiums: <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/individual-premiums/\"><u>Massachusetts ranks first</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, overall, health insurance costs are indeed higher in Massachusetts than almost anywhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, it&rsquo;s worth noting that while Massachusetts&rsquo; universal health care plan is likely a factor in producing high costs, it&rsquo;s probably not the only factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state <a href=\"http://bber.unm.edu/econ/us-pci.htm\"><u>ranked second nationally</u></a> in per capita personal income in 2012 (Connecticut was first), and it ranked <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/100876442/page/4\"><u>eighth in the nation</u></a> in highest cost of living. Whenever residents of a state make a lot of income and pay a lot for consumer goods generally, it&rsquo;s likely to follow that health care will be relatively expensive as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Massachusetts <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-spending-per-capita/\"><u>ranks first among states</u></a> in health care expenditures per capita, and most of the rest of the top 10 consists of other relatively affluent, northeastern and mid-Atlantic states: Connecticut, Maine, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. (The others are Alaska and North Dakota.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Romney said, &quot;health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country.&quot; The numbers show he&rsquo;s basically correct that Massachusetts does have higher premiums than almost every other state. On some measures, though, Alaska outranks Massachusetts.&nbsp;The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-03T13:23:58.753045", "ruling_date": "2013-11-03T13:40:35", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney says 'health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country'", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-says-health-insurance-more-expensive-m", "ruling_link_text": "Only Alaska is higher", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mitt Romney, comments on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em>, Nov. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNBC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/100876442/page/4\"><u>The Most Expensive US States to Live in</u></a>,&quot; July 15, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of New Mexico Bureau of Business &amp; Economic Research, &quot;<a href=\"http://bber.unm.edu/econ/us-pci.htm\"><u>Per Capita Personal Income by State, 1990 to 2012</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/single-coverage/\"><u>Average Single Premium per Enrolled Employee For Employer-Based Health Insurance</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/family-coverage/\"><u>Average Family Premium per Enrolled Employee For Employer-Based Health Insurance</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/individual-premiums/\"><u>Average Per Person Monthly Premiums in the Individual Market</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-spending-per-capita/\"><u>Health Care Expenditures per Capita by State of Residence</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 3, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on NBC's \"Meet the Press\"", "statement_date": "2013-11-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
