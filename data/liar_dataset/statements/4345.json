The Old Dominion and New Jersey are the only states that choose governors the year after presidential elections. There isn&rsquo;t much else to feed political junkies during these odd years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the 2009 Virginia gubernatorial race particularly piqued national interest. It came a year after Barack Obama carried Virginia, marking the first time in 44 years a Democratic presidential candidate won the state. Suddenly, reliably-Republican Virginia was recast as a critical swing state presidential politics. McDonnell&rsquo;s popularity in Virginia created a buzz about his potential for the GOP national ticket in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell, still seeking to nail down his gubernatorial win, dismissed the speculation.<br />\r\n\t&quot;The candidate doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about future ambitions, saying he will serve his full four-year term through 2013 if elected,&quot; The Virginian-Pilot reported on Oct. 17, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo days later, during his interview with Nobles, McDonnell said, &quot;You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of &nbsp;number of national political pundits that are paying an exceptional amount of attention to Virginia. I am running to be governor of Virginia...I am fully committed to four years as Virginia&rsquo;s governor.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA month after his inauguration, McDonnell reaffirmed the pledge. Dispelling rumors that he might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, McDonnell told WTOP Radio on Feb. 23, 2010: &quot;I am absolutely planning to serve for four years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell&rsquo;s response changed earlier this year when asked, for the first time, whether he would be interested in joining the GOP ticket in 2012 as the vice-presidential candidate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What if the party&rsquo;s nominee.. came to you and said &nbsp;&lsquo;for the betterment of your party and your country, I need you to serve as my running mate.&quot; Nobles asked during a &nbsp;<a href=\"http://nbc12.wordpress.com/category/mcdonnell-administration/page/2/\">February 21 interview</a>&nbsp;this year. &nbsp;&quot;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a difficult thing for you to turn down?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Probably,&quot; McDonnell replied.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell then stressed that he was honored to be governor and was not seeking to join the national ticket.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell expressed outright interest in the No. 2 spot in a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61368.html\">Politico story</a>&nbsp;that ran Aug. 15, noting the his popularity in Virginia and his recent ascension to the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;d be very interested,&quot; McDonnell was quoted as saying. &quot;It is a swing state. I&rsquo;m not asking for the call. I&rsquo;m not looking for the call. As I&rsquo;ve said many times, I&rsquo;ve got the best job in America. But I think anybody who is in public life, if a presidential nominee called him and said, &lsquo;I need your help to win,&rsquo; it would be a tremendous honor. &hellip; We&rsquo;ll see. It&rsquo;s going to be seven, eight, nine months before any of these decisions are made.&quot;<br />\r\n\t.<br />\r\n\tThe next day, McDonnell was <a href=\"http://www.vademocrats.org/news/press/it-bobs-jobs-or-bobs-bob%E2%80%99\">accused</a>&nbsp;of reneging on his promise to serve out his term by David Mills, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Virginians deserve an answer: Is McDonnell just a flip-flopper who won&rsquo;t stand by his word if it interferes with his personal political ambitions? Or did he knowingly mislead Virginia voters?&quot; Mills said in a news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTucker Martin, McDonnell&rsquo;s chief of communications, told us: &quot;The governor&rsquo;s position has been absolutely consistent on this issue. He is fully committed to serving the people of Virginia. He is planning to serve the full four years of his term.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMartin said the vice-presidential talk &quot;is a hypothetical conversation about a possible phone call that couldn&rsquo;t even happen until a year from now. You can&rsquo;t change your position on something that hasn&rsquo;t happened.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut McDonnell is no longer promising to finish his gubernatorial term. He has put out word he is interested in being nominated for vice president next year.
