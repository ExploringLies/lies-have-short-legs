There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to test that aren&#39;t taught by some liberal college professor that (tries) to indoctrinate them.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe issue received such attention that Obama on Feb. 27 addressed the issue obliquely, telling the National Governors Association that &quot;the jobs of the future are increasingly going to those with more than a high school degree. And I have to make a point here. When I speak about higher education, we&rsquo;re not just talking about a four-year degree. We&rsquo;re talking about somebody going to a community college and getting trained for that manufacturing job that now is requiring somebody walking through the door, handling a million-dollar piece of equipment. &nbsp;And they can&rsquo;t go in there unless they&rsquo;ve got some basic training beyond what they received in high school. We all want Americans getting those jobs of the future. So we&rsquo;re going to have to make sure that they&rsquo;re getting the education that they need.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObama has made no secret that he encourages Americans to go to college and has pursued policies to expand access to those who want to go.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut we received a number of requests from readers to see whether Obama went so far as to say that he &quot;wants everybody in America to go to college.&quot; We didn&rsquo;t hear back from the Santorum campaign, but we looked into Obama&rsquo;s past speeches, using both Nexis and the White House website, to locate instances in which he broached the topic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe found <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/collegespeeches/\">18 examples</a>. All but three of them make clear that Obama does not expect every young American to attend a traditional four-year, bachelors-degree-granting college or university or even a community college. In three cases, Obama did say something closer to what Santorum suggested, but still not enough to justify Santorum&#39;s claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn seven sets of remarks, Obama focused not on having every young American attend college, but rather making college a possibility for every American who wants to attend, particularly making it more affordable. Here are two that were typical (the full list is available <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/collegespeeches/\">here</a>).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.parade.com/news/2009/01/barack-obama-letter-to-my-daughters.html\">A letter by Barack Obama to his daughters, published in Parade magazine, Jan. 2009</a></strong>. &quot;In the end, girls, that&#39;s why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation. I want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential&mdash;schools that challenge them, inspire them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college&mdash;even if their parents aren&#39;t rich.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/23/remarks-president-campaign-event\">Remarks at the Biltmore Hotel, Coral Gables, Fla., Feb. 23, 2012</a></strong>. &quot;When kids graduate, I want them to be able to afford to go to college. If they&#39;ve been working hard, if they&#39;ve gotten the grades to go to college, I don&#39;t want them to cut their dreams short because they don&#39;t think they can afford it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn another four speeches, Obama focused on community colleges as an alternative to the traditional, four-year college experience. Here is one example:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; <strong>Remarks at a Democratic issues conference, Jan. 27, 2012</strong>. &quot;They don&#39;t all have to go to four-year colleges and universities -- although we need more engineers and we need more scientists, and we&#39;ve got to make sure that college is affordable and accessible. But we also need skilled workers who are going to community colleges, or middle-aged workers who are allowed to retrain, have a commitment to work, have that work ethic, but want to make sure that technology is not passing them by -- and so focusing on our community colleges, and making sure that they&#39;re matched up with businesses that are hiring right now, and making sure that they help to design the programs that are going to put them -- put people in place to get those jobs right away.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn another four speeches, Obama was quite explicit about encouraging Americans to pursue either a college education or vocational training, apprenticeships or lifelong retraining. What he said in his first address to a joint session of Congress was typical:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; <strong><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Barack-Obama-Address-to-Joint-Session-of-Congress\">Address to a Joint Session of Congress, Feb. 24, 2009</a></strong>. &quot;Tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJudging by these 15 speeches, it&rsquo;s possible to conclude that Obama favors giving all Americans the chance to get a university education if they wish, and opening up other opportunities for education beyond high school for those who do not, from community colleges to vocational training to apprenticeships.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinally, in three speeches Obama said something a little closer to what Santorum claimed he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance, in remarks at a Democratic National committee fundraiser in Austin, Texas, on May 10, 2011, he said: &quot;Our reforms are not done. I want every child in Texas and every child in America ready to graduate, ready to go to college, and actually able to afford going to college. That&#39;s how we&#39;re going to out-compete and out-educate the rest of the world. That&#39;s how America will succeed in the 21st century.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee dinner in Minneapolis, Minn., on Oct. 23, 2010, Obama said, &quot;We&#39;ve got to make sure that every young person in America is prepared for college and then can afford to go to college.&quot; And at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dinner in Rockville, Md., on Oct. 18, 2010, Obama said, &quot;How do we make sure that every young person can go to college once they get through that high school?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSantorum claimed that Obama &quot;once said he wants everybody in America to go to college.&quot; We found 18 statements from Obama about people attending college. In the vast majority of the 18, Obama talked about making college a possibility or included the option of attending community colleges or vocational training instead. We found three that offered partial support for Santorum&#39;s claim, but their tenor was mainly about opening doors for people who want to go to college, not a clear desire that everyone enroll. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Santorum backtracked on this claim during the March 4, 2012, edition of Fox News Sunday after being pressed by host Chris Wallace, <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/Boston/politicalintelligence/2012/03/rick-santorum-acknowledges-may-have-misstated-barack-obama-position-education-and-training/P3fTrPfFezlaz4H6mz80RP/index.html\">the Boston Globe reported</a>. &quot;I&#39;ve read some columns where at least it was characterized that the president said, we should go to four-year colleges,&quot;
