Does that concern you?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump responded saying he favors medical marijuana &quot;100 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But what you are talking about (with recreational marijuana), perhaps not. It&#39;s causing a lot of problems out there,&quot; Trump added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump doesn&rsquo;t bring up states rights in this interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in his subsequent interviews, with the Michigan radio station in March 2016 and the Colorado television station in July 2016, he returns to his line that states should decide the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has strongly opposed marijuana legalization. He <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2017/02/jeff-sessions-marijuana-235461\">told reporters</a> on Feb. 27, 2017 that: &quot;States they can pass the laws they choose. I would just say it does remain a violation of federal law to distribute marijuana throughout any place in the United States, whether a state legalizes it or not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long before running for president, Trump voiced strong opinions on drug legalization. In April 1990 in an <a href=\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19900414&amp;id=eUoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EHoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4675,4533445&amp;hl=en\">article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune</a>, Trump said the United States should legalize drugs and use the money collected to educate the public on the dangers of drug use. &quot;We&#39;re losing badly the war on drugs,&quot; Trump said at the time, according to the article. &quot;You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed Donald Trump, during his campaign for president, &quot;committed to honoring states&#39; rights when it comes to marijuana legalization.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In at least three campaign interviews, Trump said he thought the issue of legalizing marijuana should be left to the states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wasn&rsquo;t one of Trump&rsquo;s high-profile promises like building a wall on the Southern border. And he did not address marijuana in his major campaign speeches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he did make clear, multiple times, how he felt when asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a separate interview on Fox News, Trump expressed concern over legal pot in Colorado. But in two subsequent interviews he returned to his line that the matter should be decided by the states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, Trump&rsquo;s own words back Newsom&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated it True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-02-27T20:30:37.732427", "ruling_date": "2017-02-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "TRUE: During campaign, Trump pledged to leave marijuana legalization up to states", "ruling_headline_slug": "true-campaign-trump-said-states-should-decide-lega", "ruling_link_text": "Trump's own words back Newsom's claim", "ruling_state": "California", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>California Lt.
