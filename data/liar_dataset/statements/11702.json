But for others like that, what we&rsquo;ve found is one of the common denominators in many of these cases are people who&rsquo;ve slipped through the cracks when it comes to chronic mental illness,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.waow.com/story/30663977/2015/12/03/gov-scott-walker-reacts-to-california-shooting?utm_campaign=Contact+SNS+For+More+Referrer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=snsanalytics\">governor said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m proud that here in Wisconsin, we&rsquo;ve put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two longtime mental health advocates told us that Walker&rsquo;s funding boost was exceptional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We were hard pressed to think of anything quite as significant,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/shel-gross\">Shel Gross</a>, senior policy associate at Mental Health America of Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s see whether Walker put into the state budget more money for mental health than any governor in the last quarter-century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker&rsquo;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gov-scott-walkers-budget-to-include-29-million-for-mental-health-b68m2f2-190027561.html\">announced</a> in February 2013, in the wake of mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and at a Sikh temple and a spa in suburban Milwaukee, that he would raise spending on mental health services by <a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/2013-15%20Executive%20Budget/bib1315.pdf\">$29 million</a> in his 2013-&rsquo;15 state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The six initiatives included $12.6 million to open two units at the Mendota Mental Health Institute, a state-run psychiatric hospital in Madison for patients who have been committed, and $10.2 million for expanding community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Walker made his formal budget presentation later that month, he said only half of all Wisconsin adults with &quot;serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication&quot; -- a claim we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/08/scott-walker/wake-mass-shootings-scott-walker-says-half-wiscons/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We noted that the Wisconsin chapter of National Alliance on Mental Illness had praised the spending boost, but criticized Walker for rejecting a proposal under President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, saying his decision &quot;reflects a shallow understanding&quot; of &quot;crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mental health benefits in private-sector insurance plans are generally less comprehensive than those provided by Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that is separate from the amount of state funds Walker put into the state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back the governor&rsquo;s claim, a spokeswoman provided us a February 2013 email from Walker&rsquo;s Department of Administration that said there had not been a mental health funding boost in &quot;general purpose revenue&quot; since the creation of what was known as the &quot;community aids&quot; program in the mid-1970s. Walker&rsquo;s office also had his Department of Health Services provide us more detail in restating that his investment was the largest since the &lsquo;70s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau confirmed to us that the $29 &nbsp;million increase in state funding budgeted for mental health services in the 2013-15 state budget was the largest increase in at least 25 years, and that no other increases during that time were nearly as much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlie Morgan, a program supervisor for the fiscal bureau, told us that the total amount the state budgets for mental health services &quot;is not easily answered.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because funding for those services is provided through many programs, including: inpatient services provided by the state&#39;s mental health hospitals, community-based mental health services that are budgeted as distinct programs; and funding the state provides to counties, including for programs that provide mental health as well as substance abuse services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s clear the additional $29 million added by Walker is the largest such increase in at least 25 years, he said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said: &quot;Here in Wisconsin, we&#39;ve put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Walker refused a federal expansion of Medicaid that would have provided more mental health services to Wisconsinites. But on putting state money into the state budget for mental health, he is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-12-17T13:32:03.187603", "ruling_date": "2015-12-23T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says he put more funds into mental health than any Wisconsin governor in 25 years", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-he-put-more-funds-mental-health-", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, though opted out of Obamacare Medicaid expansion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WAOW-TV, <a href=\"http://www.waow.com/story/30663977/2015/12/03/gov-scott-walker-reacts-to-california-shooting?utm_campaign=Contact+SNS+For+More+Referrer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=snsanalytics\">video</a> of Gov.
