Spoiler alert: They don&#39;t,&quot; her campaign wrote in an Aug. 25th <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/statuses/636146978297016320\">tweet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That tweet included a campaign video released a day after Bush visited the border in McAllen, Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video shows clips of Bush and Trump saying they would repeal President Barack Obama&rsquo;s actions related to immigration, expressing concerns about &quot;anchor babies&quot; and calling for a path to legal status, not citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t let the surface distract you,&quot; Clinton says. &quot;Most of the other candidates are just Trump without the pizzazz or the hair.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We won&rsquo;t compare the personality (or hair) of Trump and Bush, but we will fact-check Clinton&rsquo;s statement that the two candidates share the same views on immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spoiler alert: the candidates&rsquo; statements on immigration policy cover a broad range of laws and topics and can&rsquo;t be boiled down to a tweet or short video. While Bush and Trump agree in some areas, they have also shown sharp contrasts on immigration policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where Bush and Trump are similar</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the areas Clinton cited in her video as evidence that Bush and Trump overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obama&rsquo;s executive action:</strong> &quot;I will immediately terminate President Obama&rsquo;s illegal executive order on immigration,&quot; Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/\">said</a> in his June 16 announcement. In his speech ,Trump didn&rsquo;t make it clear if he was referring to Obama&rsquo;s 2012 program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, or the 2014 program aimed at parents, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA. In an interview on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/17/donald-trump-on-meet-the-press-annotated/\">Meet the Press</a> in August, Trump said he would rescind DACA but he wasn&rsquo;t asked point blank about DAPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, the video shows Fox News&rsquo; Sean Hannity asking Bush, &quot;Would you repeal Obama&rsquo;s executive amnesty?&quot; and Bush replies &quot;yes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush has said he would <a href=\"http://twitchy.com/2015/04/21/jeb-bush-tells-michael-medved-he-would-take-a-pass-on-daca-dapa-and-scooby-van/\">get rid of both DACA and DAPA</a>, but a spokesman said he&rsquo;d do that after after comprehensive immigration reform passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Legal status:</strong> Trump told CNN&rsquo;s Dana Bash that if elected his plan for illegal immigrants would be to &quot;get the bad ones out.&quot; But he also called for having immigrants leave and then come back legally: &quot;I would get people out, and I would have an expedited way of getting them back into the country, so they can be legal. Let them be legal. .... I love the idea of immigration, but it&#39;s got to be legal immigration.&quot; Here is the back-and-forth that followed about legal status:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">Bash: &quot;When you say legal, do you mean legal status, or can they be eligible for citizenship?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">Trump: &quot;Legal status.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">Bash: &quot;No citizenship?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">Trump: &quot;No citizenship. We will see. Later down the line, who knows what is going to happen, but legal status.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s video then shows Hannity summarizing Bush&#39;s position as &quot;legal status, but not citizenship&quot; and Bush replies &quot;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/06/17/exclusive-jeb-bush-explains-why-is-running-for-president-on-hannity/\">exactly</a>.&quot; Bush told Hannity that his plan as outlined in his book calls for earned legal status and &quot;over an extended period of time, you earn legal status.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we compare recent statements, Trump and Bush agree on providing legal status to certain immigrants and not citizenship, but that was not always the case with Bush, because <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/jul/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-jeb-bush-no-longer-supports-p/\">at times in the past </a>he expressed support for path to citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anchor babies:</strong> &quot;I&rsquo;ll use the word anchor baby,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPKuYhKanao\">Trump said</a> Aug. 20. Then Clinton&rsquo;s video cuts to an interview in which <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-birthright-citizenship_55d51071e4b055a6dab2e315\">Bush</a> on Aug. 19 called for &quot;better enforcement so that you don&#39;t have these, you know, &#39;anchor babies,&#39; as they&#39;re described, coming into the country.&quot; In another clip Bush <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-anchor-babies_55d60f49e4b055a6dab345a5\">defends</a> his use of the term &quot;anchor babies&quot; -- a term some immigration activists find offensive. Asked by a reporter about using the term Bush said, &quot;No, I don&rsquo;t regret it. Do you have a better term?&quot; So both have used the term &quot;anchor babies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton campaign told us the tweet on Trump and Bush agreeing referred only to these areas. But we found many other specifics where Trump and Bush didn&#39;t agree that were not mentioned in the video, and that makes the tweet misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where Bush and Trump are different</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked spokespersons for the Bush and Trump campaign to cite areas where they differ on immigration policy but did not get a reply from Trump&rsquo;s campaign. Here&rsquo;s a few key examples of where they differ:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mass deportations:</strong> Trump has called for mass deportations. He said on <em>The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor</em> on Aug. 24: &quot; If I&rsquo;m elected, they&rsquo;re going to be out of here day one. We&rsquo;re going to get them the hell out of our country. They&rsquo;re going to be out so fast your head will spin.&quot; Bush has repeatedly said that mass deportation is an unrealistic solution. On his <a href=\"https://jeb2016.com/jeb-bush-fighting-for-a-conservative-immigration-reform-agenda/?lang=en\">campaign website</a> Bush said it would cost as much as $600 billion, would step on civil liberties and is &quot;a border plan that could be best described as a fantasy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A wall between Mexico and the United States:</strong> Trump wants to make Mexico <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform\">pay for a wall </a>between the two countries and impound remittances which Bush says is unrealistic. &quot;So who is going to decide who is legally remitting money back to their families in other countries? Are we going to go door-by-door and just do this? It&rsquo;s just not practical at all,&quot; Bush&nbsp;said at a town hall in Englewood, Colo., on Aug. 25.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Birthright citizenship: </strong>Trump calls for <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform\">ending birthright citizenship</a> and argues that it could be done despite the 14th amendment. Bush <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAu9O3fRFp8\">defended</a> birthright citizenship. &quot;That&rsquo;s a constitutional right. Mr. Trump can say that he&rsquo;s for this because people are frustrated that it&rsquo;s abused. But we ought to fix the problem rather than take away rights that are constitutionally in doubt,&quot; Bush told CBS&rsquo; Major Garrett on Aug. 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rhetoric:</strong> Trump has made some statements about immigration that <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2015/07/jeb-bush-condemns-donald-trumps-comments-as-extraordinarily-ugly.html\">Bush has criticized</a>, including Trump&rsquo;s comments about Mexicans: &quot;They&rsquo;re bringing crime. They&rsquo;re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people&quot; Trump said. Bush has said such rhetoric is &quot;way out of the mainstream and &quot;To make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;How do Jeb Bush and Donald Trump differ on immigration? Spoiler alert: They don&#39;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush and Trump agree in some areas, including getting rid of Obama&rsquo;s executive action. Both also call for a pathway to legal status and not citizenship, although Bush in the past has spoken in favor of citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in many other areas they disagree. Trump calls for mass deportation, ending birthright citizenship and building a wall between Mexico and the United States, all major policy changes that Bush has denounced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s overall message here that there is no daylight between Bush and Trump is misleading, although there is a kernel of truth here in that they overlap a few immigration policies. We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-28T11:42:29.169153", "ruling_date": "2015-08-28T14:35:19", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says Jeb Bush and Donald Trump share same views on immigration", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-jeb-bush-and-donald-trump-sha", "ruling_link_text": "Some similarities, some differences", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>@HillaryClinton, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/statuses/636146978297016320\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Tweet</u></a>, Aug. 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump campaign, <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Immigration reform that will make America great again,&quot;
