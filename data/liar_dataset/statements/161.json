John McCain wants to overhaul our complex tax code and turn it into something simpler. In making the case against current tax laws, he pulled together an array of statistics.\n<p>\n In a speech in September 2007, McCain got specific: \"Our tax code is so complicated it extracts $140 billion in extra tax preparation costs every year - one thousand dollars for every American family. It's offensive that six out of every ten taxpayers have to pay someone else just to figure out how to pay the government.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n According to McCain's campaign, the senator got his stats from a 2005 report from the President's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform. Some of the numbers are right.\n</p>\n<p>\n It's true that six out of 10 individual tax filers pay someone to prepare their returns, according to the IRS.\n</p>\n<p>\n But when McCain says the total cost of tax preparation is $140 billion, he's got nothing to back him up. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform that he cites has no background citations and the only place we can find that $140 billion figure is a Tax Foundation study from 2001 that referred the cost of tax preparation for individuals and businesses.\n</p>\n<p>\n A 2005 study by the Tax Foundation puts the value at closer to $111-billion. That would put the per-family cost at about $822.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this is worth noting: The dollar figure for spending on tax preparation is a calculation of the value of the time people spend working on their taxes, which the Tax Foundation put at about $39 an hour, not how much they pay to tax pros. That's not clear in McCain's statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n McCain has suggested fixing the tax code by getting a task force headed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to come up with a plan for simplifying the code and putting it to Congress for an up or down vote.\n</p>\n<p>\n McCain's point is on target; tax preparation is costly because the tax code is so complicated. But McCain is off by a good bit on the figure he uses and he's not being clear that the cost he's talking about isn't an expense of dollars but of time. That leads us to a Half True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:32.950599", "ruling_date": "2007-11-05T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "The high cost of paying taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "the-high-cost-of-paying-taxes", "ruling_link_text": "The high cost of paying taxes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Times interview with Gloria Sutton, spokeswoman for the Internal Revenue Service\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/\">\n  Final Report of the President's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n The Tax Foundation\n <a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/9bd6c31673d5cc3023471165d273b6b3.pdf\">\n  The Cost of Tax Compliance\n </a>\n July 2001\n</p>\n<p>\n The Tax Foundation\n <a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sr138.pdf\">\n  The Rising Cost of Complying With the Federal Income Tax\n </a>\n , December 2005\n</p>\n<p>\n Jill Hazelbaker, communications director for Sen.
