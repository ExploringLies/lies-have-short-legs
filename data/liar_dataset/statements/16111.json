At the time, his company, Saith Technologies, held an &quot;Open Day&quot; where he debuted his inventions and products, according to Zimbabwean <a href=\"https://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/07/saith-technology-open-day-exhibit-zimbabwes-locally-produced-drone/\">technology news site Techzim</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Zimbabwean news channel SABC Digital News also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=viGjXV38qvY\">covered</a> the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the images on Saith&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SaithTechnologies/\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/saithtech\">Twitter</a> pages are from that event, as are all of the pictures of the inventions the company claims to have created. Neither account has been active since mid-2015. The Saith Technologies website appears to have been <a href=\"http://saithtech.com/\">taken down</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chikumbutso claimed that his car runs on &quot;5 normal gel batteries.&quot; According to an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180621051639/https://www.saithtech.com/\">archived version</a> of the Saith website, a secret substance is exposed to radio wavelengths, which give the car&rsquo;s &quot;power generator&quot; the &quot;capacity to funnel the power generated into functional electrical energy&quot; and never require a recharge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the &quot;Open Day&quot; event, Techzim <a href=\"https://www.techzim.co.zw/2015/07/saith-technologies-what-is-the-real-innovation-invention/\">questioned the legitimacy</a> of Saith Technologies products. It did not report on the company again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Techzim noted that Chikumbutso&rsquo;s car was outside of the law of conservation of energy because it somehow converted 220 volt-producing gel batteries into a much higher output of 500,000 watts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist [sic] will put the claims to test,&quot; the article read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disclose.tv article says that the U.S. government &quot;recently&quot; relocated Chikumbutso to California to work on his inventions and that it might be to &quot;control this type of invention.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no evidence that this happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years ago, a man at a one-day event touted &quot;inventions,&quot; including a&nbsp;car that defies the laws of physics.
