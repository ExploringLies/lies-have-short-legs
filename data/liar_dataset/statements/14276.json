The Child Victims Act would extend the age to 28 and create a one-year revival period for past cases regardless of when they happened. Victims could also bring civil cases until age 50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill passed in the State Assembly with the support of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, but was blocked by Republicans in the State Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comedian Samantha Bee took aim at the Senate on her weekly late-night talk show last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want you to think the New York Senate is anti-child,&quot; Bee said. &quot;This session they passed legislation allowing minors to race snowmobiles, get their own hunting licenses, and not be employed gathering or picking rags, cigar stumps, or collecting bones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who does not follow New York state politics closely may be surprised by the claim. Those inside what&rsquo;s known as the &lsquo;Albany bubble&rsquo; were most likely not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Bee is known for comedy. Some may have seen her claim as satirical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were those bills a joke, or was Bee talking about legislation that actually passed the Senate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Snowmobile racing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate passed <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S136\">a bill</a> in March that would allow people under the age of 18 to compete in organized snowmobile racing events without a safety certificate from the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current law requires anyone under the age of 18 to take a state-approved safety course before they ride a snowmobile. Anyone under 14 has to also be supervised by an adult when riding. The regulations do not apply if the minor rides on land owned by their parent or guardian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill would throw out those rules as long as the minor is participating in a snowmobile racing event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Betty Little of the North Country, passed the 63-member Senate with 49 votes. The Assembly did not take up the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Looser hunting restrictions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S3156\">bill</a>, passed by the Senate in June, would allow 12-year-olds to get a universal hunting license by lowering the age for some hunting activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start hunting when you are 12 in New York, but certain restrictions remain until the hunter is 14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill would drop the age from 14 to 12 for someone to participate in muzzle-loading season, obtain muzzle-loading privileges, hunt with a crossbow, and hunt big game. The child would have to be supervised by a parent or youth mentor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sponsor, Republican Joseph Griffo, says in the bill&rsquo;s memo it&rsquo;s intended to give parents the opportunity to teach children about hunting at a younger age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill passed the Senate with 53 votes. The Assembly did not take it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Begging for money</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S2650\">bill</a> targets people who use children to panhandle on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s already illegal for someone to use a child to beg for money but the crime is under the state&rsquo;s arts and cultural affairs law instead of the penal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This bill, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeffrey Klein of the Bronx, would transfer the crime to the penal law and strengthen the penalty for repeat offenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill says someone cannot ask or allow a child under 16 to beg for money or receive payment for &quot;picking rags, or collecting cigar stumps, or collecting bones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That provision has actually been in state law since 1971. It&rsquo;s part of a broader law that bans children from doing several things for money. Among the more interesting: children cannot be employed as tightrope walkers and cannot receive money for displaying a physical deformity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Klein bill to move the crime to the penal law passed the Senate in June with 55 votes. The bill was not taken up in the Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comedian Samantha Bee said the New York State Senate &quot;passed legislation allowing minors to race snowmobiles, get their own hunting licenses, and not be employed gathering or picking rags, cigar stumps, or collecting bones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the bills is real and passed the Senate this year. Her claim is True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-29T16:28:40.046064", "ruling_date": "2017-06-30T12:43:23", "ruling_headline": "Joke about bills passed by NY State Senate is not a joke", "ruling_headline_slug": "joke-about-bills-passed-ny-state-senate-not-joke", "ruling_link_text": "Yep, the Senate passed each of these", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/S136\">Senate Bill 136</a>, sponsored by Sen.
