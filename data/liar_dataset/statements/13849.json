That is, the difference between each party&#39;s &quot;wasted&quot; votes in an election -- where votes are wasted if they are cast for a losing candidate, or for a winning candidate but in excess of what the candidate needed to win -- divided by the total number of votes cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephanopoulos told us Wisconsin&rsquo;s ranking differs in the two studies because the studies treated uncontested races differently. But whether Wisconsin ranks fifth or second &quot;is just a matter of a percentage point or two, and is substantively irrelevant,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some caveats, though, as other redistricting experts noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wooster.edu/academics/areas/mathematics/emeriti/\">Charles Hampton</a>, an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at Wooster College in Ohio, said he thought the second study was too dependent on vote totals in its analysis and not on the redistricting plan itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/expert/michael-li\">Michael Li</a>, who is senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice Democracy Program at New York University School of Law, told us the &quot;partisan biases&quot; found in the studies can be largely but not completely explained by gerrymandering.
