A year prior, the state had 3,325,600 private-sector jobs. That&rsquo;s a net loss of 115,700 jobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tJoseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed with that figure.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that in other fact-checks about private-sector job gains and losses in New Jersey, Christie had cited a figure of 117,000.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBy either measure, Christie&rsquo;s numbers are off a bit. One reason is that the BLS has &quot;benchmarked&quot; its numbers, according to the state Labor Department.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;Benchmarking at BLS has taken place, which is a backward look at the numbers and adjustments based on newer, fuller data,&quot; Labor Department spokesman Brian Murray explained in an e-mail. &quot;It is done annually, and the look back goes anywhere from two years to further back.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish confirmed how benchmarking works.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNext, we need to determine whether Corzine really is to blame for those lost jobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s point out that the first half of 2009 &ndash; Corzine&rsquo;s last year in office &ndash; was marked by recession.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit research group, has said the &lsquo;Great Recession&rsquo; began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Lingering effects from the economic slowdown, however, have continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAlso, as economic experts have told us for previous and similar rulings about private-sector job growth in New Jersey, the governor not only can&rsquo;t take all the credit for job gains, he can&rsquo;t pin blame for loss solely on another administration when there are other factors at work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not return a request for comment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them &quot;Corzine jobs losses of 2009.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tChristie is off a bit, since data from the BLS and state Labor Department show that New Jersey lost 115,700 jobs from December 2008 to 2009 &ndash; a period marked by the height of the recession, and something that economic experts have told us cannot be blamed solely on one person.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSince the governor&rsquo;s number is off slightly and the claim implies that Corzine is to blame for those job losses, we give Christie a ruling that he&rsquo;s had before on these types of fact-checks: Half True.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTo comment on this story go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/politifact_nj_chris_christie_claims_state_lost_119000_jobs_during_corzines_last_year_as_governor.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-20T14:39:52.689123", "ruling_date": "2013-03-21T09:53:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims 119,000 private-sector jobs lost during last year of Corzine tenure as governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-119000-private-sector-jobs-l", "ruling_link_text": "Same ol' blame game", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.32002571548812786\">\r\n\tNJ.com, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/03/christie_speech_edison_busines.html#incart_river_default\">Chris Christie touts conservative fiscal policy in campaign-style speech to business group</a>, March 6, 2013, accessed March 19 and 20, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website</a>, accessed March 19 and 20, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tE-mail interview with Brian Murray, spokesman, New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, March 19, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tE-mail interview with Joseph J.
