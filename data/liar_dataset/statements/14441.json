That&rsquo;s going to happen. The other thing, very important: I believe wages will start going up. They haven&rsquo;t gone up for a long time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Trump correct that wages &quot;haven&rsquo;t gone up for a long time?&quot; Short answer: No. They&rsquo;re going up now, in fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s true that wages were stagnant for several years -- especially after the Great Recession -- they have been on an upward swing since early 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put together the following chart showing median, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for wage and salaried workers, 16 years of age and older, going back to 1979:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It shows that for much of the time between 2012 and 2014, median weekly earnings were lower than they were in 1979 -- a frustrating disappearance of any wage growth for 35 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that began changing in 2014. After hitting a low of $330 a week in early 2014, wages have risen to $354 a week by early 2017. That&rsquo;s an increase of 7.3 percent over a roughly three-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In this case, you can say the president is flatly wrong,&quot; said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. &quot;Real wages have been rising more slowly than anyone wishes, except perhaps employers. Nonetheless, they have been rising.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burtless noted that the increases for a subset of all workers -- &quot;production and non-supervisory employees&quot; -- have been occurring for even longer. They&rsquo;ve gone up every month but two since late 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jed Kolko, the chief economist with the jobs site Indeed.com, added that &quot;not only have wages gone up overall, but wages are now increasing most for people with less education. So, wage gains aren&#39;t being driven only by top earners.&quot; He provided this chart, showing that non-college full-time employees have been growing by 3 percent to 4 percent a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LrjmXRnhi72-txhbEndjQAQDCIqAvTd0GAlrASmz9kZTekGuoHdPC61JjpRf64hQ-Qki6AugxyhoDjKPL7MlWAEqkxFXAa6tKV4HM-L7IemyQ8FiWD9JEE3T_xgY1nTdfhnd91a6\" style=\"border:none; height:372px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House did not respond to an inquiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that wages &quot;haven&rsquo;t gone up for a long time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was once accurate, but it&rsquo;s significantly out of date.
