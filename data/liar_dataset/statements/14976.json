Many of the earners live in New York City and its suburban counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Mujica right that 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s income tax revenue comes from the New York City area?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In context</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>State lawmakers are considering several options to respond to the new federal tax code&rsquo;s cap on state and local tax deductions. The new federal law caps those deductions at $10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One proposal would shift state income tax from the employee to the employer. Businesses and corporations can still deduct state and local taxes without a cap under the new tax law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The employee would no longer pay a state income tax, but the employer would take on a new, deductible tax. The shift would be voluntary.

Those in Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties paid $12.1 billion in state income taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total for those in New York City and the three counties came to $31.3 billion, or 66 percent of the state total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another $7.8 billion came from non-residents who commuted into New York state for work. Most of those filers worked in New York City, according to a spokesperson from the agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you add the revenue from non-residents to that of New York City, Westchester, and Long Island filers, the share increases to 82 percent of the state total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York City region&rsquo;s high share of income tax revenue shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise,&nbsp;considering its population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Close to 12.3 million people live in New York City, Westchester and on Long Island. That counts for about 62 percent of the state&rsquo;s total population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Residents in upstate counties, meanwhile, paid close to $8.4 billion in income taxes, or about 18 percent of the state total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mujica said &quot;70 percent of the income tax that the state collects happens to come from Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and New York City.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual number is somewhere between 66 percent and 82 percent, according to data from the state Division of Budget.
