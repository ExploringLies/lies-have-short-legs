Davis Has A Lot To Answer For,&quot; Abbott said Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, campaigned with U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Chicago, a liberal initially elected to Congress in 1998. &nbsp;Abbott&rsquo;s campaign manager, Wayne Hamilton, said in the release: &quot;Sen. Davis&rsquo; fundraising on behalf of an extreme liberal Chicago congresswoman &ndash; a member of the Democratic Socialists For America no less &ndash; is merely the latest in a series of questions Sen. Davis has refused to answer about her ethics and her judgment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not unheard of for someone to assert a foe is a socialist. But such claims haven&rsquo;t held up in our past fact checks and Abbott&rsquo;s statement ultimately lacked confirmation as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/05/blog-posting/bloggers-say-two-texas-democrats-among-socialists-/\"><u>rated as Pants on Fire</u></a> a claim that U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston and Eddie Berniece Johnson of Dallas were among Socialists in Congress. At the time, a leader of the Democratic Socialists of America said no members of Congress were members of its party. The next year, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-barack-obama-socialist/\"><u>gave the same rating</u></a> to a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that President Barack Obama was a socialist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott&rsquo;s May 6, 2014, release pointed out that a May 5, 2014, <em>Chicago Sun-Times </em>news <a href=\"http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/schakowsky-fundraiser-features-lizz-winstead-wendy-davis-quinn/mon-05052014-719am\"><u>blog post</u></a> said Davis, who <a href=\"http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/texas-wendy-davis-hits-chicago-fundraiser-sunday/mon-04282014-205pm\"><u>had raised money </u></a>for her own campaign in Chicago May 4, was going to be among featured guests for Schakowsky&rsquo;s annual &quot;Ultimate Women&#39;s Power Lunch&quot; at midday along with Lizz Winstead, co-creator of the Daily Show, and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, Sweet wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott&rsquo;s offered basis for the socialist claim was an Oct. 16, 2010, National Review <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/249999/jan-schakowsky-and-socialism-stanley-kurtz\"><u>blog post</u></a> on &quot;The Corner,&quot; a National Review Online blog that <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/taxonomy/term/22/about\"><u>describes itself</u></a> as a &quot;web-leading source of real-time conservative opinion.&quot; The 2010 post, by <a href=\"http://www.eppc.org/fellows-scholars/stanley-kurtz/\"><u>Stanley Kurtz</u></a>, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center, said Kurtz had earlier come across &quot;documentary evidence&quot; that Schakowsky was a member of the the <a href=\"http://www.dsausa.org/\"><u>Democratic Socialists of America</u></a> (not the Democratic Socialists For America) at the start of her political career. Kurtz&rsquo;s post closed by saying the &quot;idea of socialist politicians working openly or quietly within the Democratic Party is not a wild impossibility but a real phenomenon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No documents were included in the blog post to back up his claim that Schakowsky had been a member of the socialist group. So we followed up with Kurtz, who said by email that Schakowsky was an &quot;active member&quot; of Chicago&rsquo;s DSA chapter in the 1980s, a conclusion he said he based on chapter newsletters from 1983 and 1986 that he said he viewed in archives at New York University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not know how long&quot; Schakowsky &quot;remained a member of the DSA,&quot; Kurtz wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we published this fact check, Kurtz told us by email that he sent Breitbart Texas <a href=\"http://www.docstoc.com/docs/169691404/Schakowsky-DSApdf\">copies of the relevant newsletter pages</a>. The February/March 1983 issue of the Chicago Socialist, published by the Chicago chapter, credits Schakowsky as the author of an article recapping a meeting of the Illinois Public Action Council, a mix of progressive groups. A June 1986 newsletter item, headlined &quot;DSAers on the move,&quot; states that on the local political scene, Schakowsky&rsquo;s bid &quot;for Cook County Board got a boost when she drew 2nd ballot position among 14 candidates.&quot; The <a href=\"http://www.cookcountygov.com/portal/server.pt/community/government/226/leadership/314\">Cook County Board of Commissioners</a> is the county&rsquo;s legislative body. By email, Bob Roman, secretary of the Chicago DSA chapter, told us the posted newsletter excerpts were authentic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schakowsky&rsquo;s House spokesman, Lee Whack, referred us to her campaign political director, Alex Armour, who didn&rsquo;t engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By telephone, Maria Svart, the national director of the DSA, noted the group is an activist and educational group and not a political party. She also reaffirmed what a predecessor in that role, Frank Llewellyn,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/05/blog-posting/bloggers-say-two-texas-democrats-among-socialists-/\"> <u>told us in 2011</u></a>. To join the group, a person must fill out a form and pay dues, Llewellyn said, adding that the last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Svart also said that while the group doesn&rsquo;t announce its members, as far as she knows, Schakowsky isn&rsquo;t a member and never was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, we spotted a web post by the Chicago chapter of the DSA showing Schakowsky spoke at the group&rsquo;s May 13, 2011, Eugene V. Debs-Norman Thomas-Michael Harrington <a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/d2011/book2011.pdf\"><u>dinner</u></a> celebrating union organizers and other activists on the left. <a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/ngarchive/ng136.html\"><u>A May-June 2011 DSA recap</u></a> said Schakowsky told guests that despite Democrats being the House minority, she was optimistic in that conservatives in Congress had over-reached. A DSA <a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/dthdin.html\"><u>web page</u></a> on the history of the annual dinner lists Schakowsky as the 2000 dinner&rsquo;s honoree. That listing led to another <a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/d2000.html#anchor1228681\"><u>web post</u></a> detailing why Schakowsky was honored, touching on her actions as a consumer advocate and state and federal legislator. It didn&rsquo;t speak to her membership (or not) in the DSA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Roman said Schakowsky is &quot;not somebody that we claim as a member.&quot; He also said he generally doesn&rsquo;t comment on whether anyone is current or former member. &quot;Once you say &lsquo;so and so&rsquo; is a member, was a member or was never a member, then you open yourself to queries about any single person who has ever been a member,&quot; Roman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas emailed us a copy of <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGcU5LbGlNQWJEcXM/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>the invitation</u></a> to the Schakowsky event attended by Davis. The invitation &nbsp;lacks mention of Davis--and lists Winstead as the star attraction. Petkanas also provided what he described as the prepared text of <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGQVlTNnhkenNJY00/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Davis&rsquo; remarks</u></a> at the event, which do not include an appeal for donations to Schakowsky&rsquo;s political kitty. &quot;Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign,&quot; Petkanas said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott said Davis raised money for a member of a socialist group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis appeared at a Chicago fund-raiser for Schakowsky, who may have once participated in the Chicago chapter of the DSA and has been saluted by it. Abbott didn&rsquo;t provide, nor did we find, evidence of Schakowsky being a current member of the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We light a match when a statement lacks factual backup and seems ridiculous.
