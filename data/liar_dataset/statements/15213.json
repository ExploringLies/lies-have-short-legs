They are now mad that our census, which for years and years and years, decades, has asked, &lsquo;Are you a citizen of the United States of America?&rsquo; &ndash; they are mad that the census asks that simple question.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is McDaniel correct?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has the citizenship question that is now at the center of a debate already been asked for &quot;years and years and years&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history section of the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s web page notes that the first U.S. census was taken in <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/overview/1790.html\">1790</a>. At that time the questions asked for the name of the head of the family and the number of persons in each household, including slaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of its announcement, the Commerce Department said that citizenship questions have been included on prior censuses: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2018/03/us-department-commerce-announces-reinstatement-citizenship-question-2020\">1820 and 1950</a>, almost every decennial census asked a question on citizenship in some form. Today, surveys of sample populations, such as the Current Population Survey and the ACS (American Community Survey), continue to ask a question on citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to our colleagues at <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/mar/28/what-you-need-know-about-census-citizenship-questi/\">PolitiFact National</a>, the last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1950_population_questionnaire.pdf\">1950 Census</a>. That census questioned where individuals were born, and &quot;if foreign-born &mdash; is he naturalized?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1960, the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1960censusquestionnaire-2.pdf\">census</a> only asked about place of birth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1970 to 2000, the Census Bureau used<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/questionnaires/\"> two questionnaires</a>: a long-form and short-form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most households received the short-form questionnaire, which covered basic questions, while about 1 in 6 households received a long-form questionnaire that included a question on citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2010 Census, the most recent one, <a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/help/en/short_form.htm\">only used a short-form questionnaire</a> with 10 questions. None of those related to citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the mid-2000s the Census Bureau began gathering demographic and socioeconomic information through the American Community Survey, or ACS. The survey &nbsp;collects information from about 3.5 million households a year and asks about citizenship status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ACS asks such questions as &quot;In what U.S. state, territory, commonwealth or foreign country was this person born?&quot; Another question is &quot;Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea with both the now-defunct long-form and the ongoing ACS survey is to use a large sample of responses to draw conclusions about the population as whole, much as a poll does not need to contact every voter to be considered valid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McDaniel said the census &quot;for years and years and years, decades, has asked, &lsquo;Are you a citizen of the United States of America?&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 census. But in the decades since, some version of the question has been asked in nearly every census -- either through the <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/74934/rip-census-long-form\">now-defunct &quot;long form&quot;</a> or the ongoing annual surveys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2020 census calls for <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/29/598018163/census-bureau-releases-2020-census-questions-including-1-on-citizenship\">asking all households</a> the citizenship question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate McDaniel&rsquo;s claim Mostly True. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-02T15:48:37.800045", "ruling_date": "2018-04-03T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel says U.S. Census Bureau has asked citizenship questions for decades", "ruling_headline_slug": "rnc-chair-ronna-mcdaniel-says-us-census-bureau-ask", "ruling_link_text": "Answer in long and short forms", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2018/03/us-department-commerce-announces-reinstatement-citizenship-question-2020\">U.S. Department of Commerce</a> press release &quot;U.S. Department of Commerce Announces Reinstatement of Citizenship Question to the 2020 Decennial Census,&quot; March 26, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTAQ <a href=\"http://wtaq.com/podcasts/mid-morning-news/921/rnc-chairwomen-ronna-mcdaniel/\">&quot;Restoring Reason&quot;</a> with John Muir, audio heard at about the 10:28 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/2020-census-add-question-citizenship-status-54030706\">ABC News</a> &quot;Decision to add citizenship question to census draws protest,&quot; March 27, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1950_population_questionnaire.pdf\">1950 Census</a> of Population and Housing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/mar/28/what-you-need-know-about-census-citizenship-questi/\">PolitiFact National</a>, &quot;What You Need to Know About the Census&rsquo; Citizenship Question,&quot; March 28, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/overview/1790.html\">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, &quot;1790 Overview&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of the Census &quot;<a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaires/Quest96to98.pdf\">American Community Survey</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau 1960 Census <a href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/aDDgCjRgzqS43AVyFnYHJ2?domain=census.gov\">https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1960censusquestionnaire-2.pdf</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/183635/number-of-households-in-the-us/\">Statista</a> &quot;Number of households in the U.S. from 1960 to 2017 (in millions). &nbsp;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census/u-s-to-add-citizenship-question-in-2020-census-commerce-dept-idUSKBN1H308B?il=0\">Reuters</a>, &quot;U.S. to add citizenship question to 2020 Census,&quot; March 26, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/29/598018163/census-bureau-releases-2020-census-questions-including-1-on-citizenship\">National Public Radio</a>, &quot;The 2020 Census Questions Every U.S. Household Will Be Asked,&quot; March 29, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/74934/rip-census-long-form\">The New Republic</a>, &quot;R.I.P.
