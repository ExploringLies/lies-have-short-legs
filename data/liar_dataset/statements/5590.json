The legislation passed with a pretty wide margin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the debate, statistics were thrown out left and right in support of the new policy. One in particular caught our attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile speaking in favor of House Bill 4077, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, said &quot;teen dating violence is where it all starts, and where it ends is with the fact that the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. (for) women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner. No. 2 cause of death. Only exceeded by automobile accidents.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s no disputing that intimate partner violence, as it&#39;s commonly referred to in support circles, is a major problem nationally and worldwide. But could it really be the second leading cause of death for women under the age of 50?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMonroe didn&#39;t have any support for his claim when we reached him at home. He mentioned that he&#39;d heard the statistic some eight years ago at a conference in San Diego. Since then, he said, he&#39;d read it in several articles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithout a lead, we had to start from scratch. Our first step was to check in with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has a specific division that looks into injury and violence prevention. As it happens, injury is the leading cause of death for Americans between ages 1 and 44.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGail Hayes, a spokeswoman for the Injury Center, showed us how to drill down into the data on hand.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked for the leading causes of death for women between the ages of 1 and 50 from 1999 to 2009. This is what we found, in descending order: Malignant neoplasms (cancer), unintentional injury (largely motor vehicle accidents and poisoning), heart disease, suicide, stroke and then -- at sixth place -- homicide, which would include intimate partner violence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfortunately, you can&#39;t dig down any deeper into the homicide category to get a good idea of just how many of those are perpetrated by intimate partners. Even if we could have gone further, the rankings didn&#39;t seem to support Monroe. Once you remove biological causes of death -- cancer, heart attack and stroke -- homicide comes in at third place, after unintentional injuries and suicide.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHayes was kind enough to check in with some of the Injury Center scientists to see if they&#39;d heard the statistic that Monroe cited. The best she could come up with was the fact that just over 41 percent of female homicides aged 1-50 were &quot;intimate-partner related.&quot; But, she said, that data applied to only 16 states and couldn&#39;t be reliably nationalized.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CDC had some recent reports on the issues of intimate partner violence, but none of them referenced Monroe&#39;s statistic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur next step was a call to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. We spoke with Angela Hale who also said she hadn&#39;t heard of the statistic that we were trying to verify.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did find a similar statistic referenced in the abstract for a paper published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. Ultimately, that lead never panned out. The closest we could find was a another report from 1991 that stated &quot;violence was the second most common cause of injury overall and the most common cause of injury of women aged 15-44.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut violence didn&#39;t necessarily mean intimate partner violence. In fact, the only thing the article says about such violence is that 62 percent of the violent incidents involved husbands or boyfriends.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, we ended where we started: With no source to back up the claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the end, the onus is on the speaker to offer a source for what he said. Monroe didn&#39;t have one -- and after days of searching, we couldn&#39;t find one. There is no doubt that intimate partner violence is a serious issue, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any evidence that it ranks as the No. 2 cause of the death for women under 50. The highest it might rank -- and even this is a stretch -- is sixth place, according to CDC data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/03/is_intimate_partner_violence_t.html\">Return to OregonLive to comment on this rating.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-19T20:22:07.638512", "ruling_date": "2012-03-19T17:20:33", "ruling_headline": "Is intimate partner violence the second leading cause of death for women under 50?", "ruling_headline_slug": "intimate-partner-violence-second-leading-cause-dea", "ruling_link_text": "There's no source to back the claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Sen.
