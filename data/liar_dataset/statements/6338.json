Vincent Fort, a Democrat who represents a district that stretches from East Point through parts of Atlanta. The proposal goes before voters on Tuesday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We shouldn&#39;t be putting a sales tax on people&#39;s food and medicine,&quot; Fort said in a television news story that aired on CBS Atlanta (WGCL-TV) on July 21.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYour PolitiFact Georgia reporters have vetted nearly two dozen claims about the upcoming penny-per-dollar tax, which would raise an estimated $8.5 billion (after inflation) for transportation projects over the next 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we hadn&rsquo;t heard Fort&rsquo;s claim. Will the transportation tax really increase taxes on food and medicine?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s not in dispute,&quot; Fort told PolitiFact Georgia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFort said his statement referred to groceries and over-the-counter medicine, and that he was uncertain whether prescription drugs would be taxed under the plan. Later, he called us back to say that a legislative staffer informed him that prescription drugs were exempt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe reviewed state law and consulted with a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Revenue to check Fort&rsquo;s account.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tax referendum was born out of Georgia&rsquo;s Transportation Investment Act of 2010, otherwise known as House Bill 277. The bill divided the state into 12 regions so that voters could decide whether to add a 1 percent sales tax to pay for local transportation system upgrades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese regional taxes would have to meet certain criteria, the bill said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne is that the tax would apply to the sale of food and beverages. The sale of &quot;food and food ingredients to an individual consumer for off-premises human consumption&quot; is exempted from the state&rsquo;s sales tax, but local governments may tax it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother criteria is that other existing sales tax exemptions would apply. Under current state law, prescription drugs are exempt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe transportation plan would therefore impose a regional tax on groceries such as a loaf of bread or bananas. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt also would tax over-the-counter medications such as the aspirin you took for the headache you got from listening to the transportation debate rhetoric. But prescription drugs would remain tax-free.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the bill specifies that groceries will be taxed, it makes sure other items are not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJet fuel is exempt, as is fuel used for off-road, heavy-duty equipment or locomotives. So are motor fuel and energy used during manufacturing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFort&rsquo;s claim holds up well. &quot;Food and medicine&quot; would be taxed under the new plan, just not prescription drugs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFort got the important stuff right, but he could have been a little more precise and said &quot;non-prescription medicine.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, he earns a Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-26T16:44:00.692294", "ruling_date": "2012-07-27T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Transportatioplan tax foe says plan hikes prices on food, medicine", "ruling_headline_slug": "transportatioplan-tax-foe-says-plan-hikes-prices-f", "ruling_link_text": "He got the important stuff right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCBS Atlanta (WGCL-TV), &nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/19081900/transportation-tax-at-top-of-early-voters-minds\">Transportation tax at top of early voters&#39; minds</a>,&quot; July 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia General Assembly, <a href=\"http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2009_10/versions/hb277_HB_277_AP_10.htm\">Transportation Investment Act of 2010</a>, accessed July 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOfficial Code of Georgia Annotated, <a href=\"http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/gacode/Default.asp\">Title 48-8-3</a>, accessed July 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, state Sen.
