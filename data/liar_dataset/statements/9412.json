The story quoted city officials as saying those weapons could legally be toted outside the Fort Worth Convention Center but inside, &quot;it&rsquo;s a different matter because there&rsquo;s a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;State officials have been reminding Texans that any business with a state permit to serve alcohol may not knowingly let people carry long guns,&quot; the paper said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broadly a few days later, Mike Hashimoto, an editorial columnist for the<em> Dallas Morning News</em>, took exception to Texans strolling around with rifles in a <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/columnists/mike-hashimoto/20140602-mike-hashimoto-open-carry-clowns-just-another-its-all-about-me-front-group.ece\"><u>commentary</u></a>, describing them as &quot;chuckleheads strapping on their long rifles and marching into the local Chipotle or Chili&rsquo;s or Home Depot. Whatever point they may have about gun-owner rights or Texas law they drown in look-at-me stupidity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashimoto kicked us into action with this factual claim: &quot;Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up front, we recognized numerous news accounts have said the same, including a June 2, 2014, <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/nra-rips-open-carry-rallies-in-texas/ngCDn/\"><u>story</u></a> stating: &quot;Texas law allows owners to openly carry rifles but not sidearms in most situations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the National Rifle Association brought up what the law permits in a May 30, 2014, <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/articles/2014/5/good-citizens-and-good-neighbors-the-gun-owners-role.aspx\"><u>blog post</u></a> questioning the &quot;unneighborly&quot; actions of individuals trying to make Second Amendment points by hauling rifles into coffee shops and restaurants. &quot;Texas, independent-minded and liberty-loving place that it is, doesn&#39;t ban the carrying of loaded long guns in public, nor does it require a permit for this activity,&quot; the association said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeking statutory detail, we reached the legislative director of the Texas State Rifle Association, Alice Gene Tripp, who told us the Texas penal code restricts handguns, but it&rsquo;s silent per toting long rifles and shotguns. Tripp pointed us to <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm\"><u>Section 46.02 of the code</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Hashimoto also singled out that section, saying it put limits on handguns, illegal knives and clubs, among specific weapons, not mentioning long rifles or shotguns. &quot;From discussing this over the years with law enforcement officials, my understanding is that rifles and shotguns, therefore, were legal for open carry in Texas,&quot; Hashimoto said. &quot;I&#39;ve not questioned that understanding recently, as open-carry demonstrations have become more common, yet demonstrators, generally, have not been arrested for unlawfully carrying weapons.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 46.02 states it&rsquo;s at least a Class A misdemeanor if a person &quot;intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his or her person a handgun, illegal knife, or club if the person is not on the person&rsquo;s own premises or premises under the person&rsquo;s control or in or directly en route to a motor vehicle&quot;(including a recreational vehicle &quot;or boat they own or control.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we contacted Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner who as a state senator authored the 1995 law enabling Texans to carry concealed handguns with state permits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Patterson said: &quot;Long gun &lsquo;open carry&rsquo; has never been unlawful in Texas to my knowledge. How do you use a shotgun or rifle if you can&#39;t carry it openly?&lrm; Would you have to wrap it up if you placed it in your pickup gun rack?&quot; Still, he pointed out&nbsp; out <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.42.htm\"><u>section 42.01 (a) (8)</u></a> of the penal code, which states a person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly &quot;displays a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashimoto wrote: &quot;Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas law explicitly restricts handguns and some other weapons from being openly carried around. But the law is silent on long rifles. Generally, another provision says no one should display a firearm in a manner calculated to alarm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim as True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-05T15:07:52.893130", "ruling_date": "2014-06-05T14:21:11", "ruling_headline": "Texas law permits long rifles to be toted in public", "ruling_headline_slug": "texas-law-effectively-permits-long-rifles-be-toted", "ruling_link_text": "Just don't alarm", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Telephone interview, Alice Gene Tripp, legislative director, Texas State Rifle Association, Fort Worth, June 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JFILVKF9i-3xYpcbG2NIIiasgesLKaz-IBMQ3owxPKs/pub\"><u>Email,</u></a> Mike Hashimoto, editorial writer, Dallas Morning News, June 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas law, <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm\"><u>&quot;PENAL CODE &nbsp;TITLE 10.
