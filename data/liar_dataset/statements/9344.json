Back-and-forth ads between incumbent Mark Begich, a Democrat, and former Attorney General Dan Sullivan, a Republican frontrunner, have both slung<strong> </strong>accusations of Koch affiliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pro-Begich super PAC, Put Alaska First, fired the first shot in April. It released the ad &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4WLsWuvMZ0\"><u>Lost</u></a>,&quot; which criticized Sullivan for not doing enough to prevent the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/apr/21/did-koch-brothers-run-alaskan-oil-refinery-ground/\"><u>Koch-owned refinery</u></a> from closing, resulting in a loss of 80 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Dan Sullivan remains silent about the jobs being lost here,&quot; the ad said. &quot;And those same billionaires, the Koch brothers, are supporting his campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next week Sullivan released a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNtZsaD-wJM\"><u>radio ad</u></a>: &quot;Dan Sullivan has never taken a dime from the Koch brothers,&quot; the narrator said. &quot;It&rsquo;s Begich who has taken campaign cash from the Kochs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Democrat, Begich wouldn&rsquo;t be a typical recipient of Koch funds. So we decided to fact-check whether the attack was accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our colleagues at FactCheck.org <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2014/05/outright-lies-in-alaska/\"><u>pointed out</u></a> that although Sullivan hasn&rsquo;t accepted money directly from the Koch brothers or their affiliates, the Koch-backed Americans For Prosperity&nbsp;has&nbsp;spent <a href=\"http://www.alaskapublic.org/2014/03/19/the-koch-effect-two-rich-guys-democrats-love-to-hate/\">nearly $1 million</a> on Begich attack ads. Sullivan isn&#39;t receiving those funds, but he does benefit from an attack on his opponent that can&#39;t be legally coordinated directly between the candidate and the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Begich, we found that KochPAC, a Koch Industries group, gave <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pac2pac.php?cycle=2010&amp;cmte=C00236489\"><u>$5,000</u></a> to Begich&rsquo;s Great Land PAC back in 2010. Begich&rsquo;s PAC primarily gives money to candidates, as well as state and federal Democratic parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, the Kochs <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/koch-brothers-democrats-104787.html\"><u>also gave money</u></a> to Democratic senators like Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor and Chuck Schumer. In 2013 and 2014, they haven&rsquo;t given any money to Democratic Senate candidates, and just three Democratic House candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said she&rsquo;d be surprised to see much Koch money going to Democrats this cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Koch Industries spokesman <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/koch-brothers-democrats-104787.html\"><u>told Politico in March 2014</u></a> that KochPAC doesn&rsquo;t base its donations on the candidate&rsquo;s party, but rather on the company&rsquo;s business and policy interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sullivan said Mark Begich &quot;has taken campaign cash from the Kochs&quot; but that Sullivan &quot;hasn&rsquo;t taken a dime.&quot; In 2010, KochPAC donated $5,000 to a Begich-affiliated PAC. But that&#39;s a modest amount by campaign-finance standards, and Begich hasn&rsquo;t received any more in the past four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While<strong> </strong>Sullivan hasn&rsquo;t received money directly from the Kochs, he and Begich&rsquo;s other Republican challengers certainly benefit from the much larger TV ad buys by Koch-affiliated groups attacking the Democrat. A Koch-funded group, Americans For Prosperity, has spent nearly $1 million in Alaska benefiting Sullivan and other Republicans in the race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-19T16:21:39.274156", "ruling_date": "2014-05-19T17:00:30", "ruling_headline": "GOP opponent says Mark Begich took campaign money from Koch brothers", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-opponent-says-mark-begich-took-campaign-money-", "ruling_link_text": "Begich got just $5,000 four years ago, none since", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Max Croes, Mark Begich campaign spokesman, May 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email and phone interviews with Mike Anderson, Dan Sullivan campaign spokesman, May 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Viveca Novak, Center for Responsive Politics spokeswoman, May 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org, &quot; <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2014/05/outright-lies-in-alaska/\"><u>&lsquo;Outright lies&rsquo; in Alaska?</u></a>&quot; May 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets.org, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cmte=C00457747&amp;cycle=2014\"><u>Great Land PAC</u></a>,&quot; April 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pac2pac.php?cycle=2010&amp;cmte=C00236489\"><u>Koch Industries 2010 cycle</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 4, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/koch-brothers-democrats-104787.html\"><u>Back when the Kochs gave to Democrats&hellip;</u></a>&quot; March 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put Alaska First, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4WLsWuvMZ0\"><u>Lost</u></a>,&quot; April 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sullivan for Senate, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNtZsaD-wJM\"><u>No shame</u></a>,&quot; April 29, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Alaska Department of Public Resources commissioner", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Dan", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Alaska", "id": 2648, "last_name": "Sullivan", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "dan-sullivan", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Sullivan.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2648/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.sullivan2014.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says<strong> </strong>Mark Begich &quot;has taken campaign cash from the Kochs&quot; while Dan Sullivan hasn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio ad", "statement_date": "2014-04-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
