Scott Walker unveiled his state budget, Twitter lit up with this claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tweets were a copy-and-paste of a headline on <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2015/02/02/3616140/scott-walker-university-students/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an article</u></a> by Think Progress, a liberal blog, that was posted the same day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was an eye-catching claim that went too far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The cut</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part of the claim in the tweets is on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than a week before formally introducing his 2015-&#39;17 budget, Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/walker-proposes-13-cut-more-freedom-for-uw-system-b99433644z1-289880441.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>revealed</u></a> that he would propose cutting $300 million over two years from the University of Wisconsin System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top officials in <a href=\"https://www.wisconsin.edu/about-the-uw-system/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the system</u></a>, which includes the University of Wisconsin-Madison flagship and 25 other four-year and two-year schools, said the plan likely would lead to <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-proposes-300-million-cut-more-autonomy-for-uw-b99433799z1-289929831.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>layoffs</u></a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In exchange, the system would get more control over its budget and more freedom from state rules in its operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s proposed cut -- $150 million for each year of the biennium, for a total of $300 million -- amounts to a 13 percent reduction in state aid for the UW System. That <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/scott-walker-says-uw-faculty-should-teach-more-classes-do-more-work-b99434737z1-290087401.html\">reportedly</a> would be the largest cut ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that state funding accounts for $1.2 billion of the system&#39;s total budget of $6 billion. Walker&rsquo;s cut in state aid would amount to 2.5 percent of the total budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We won&#39;t know until mid-2015 whether the cut ultimately becomes part of the final budget approved by the Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is no dispute that the $300 million reduction for universities is what Walker has proposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The arena</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money for a new basketball arena is more complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The owners of the NBA&rsquo;s Milwaukee Bucks are trying to assemble private and public financing to build a new arena. The total cost is projected at about $500 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is not the amount Walker is proposing to spend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the university cuts, Walker announced his arena proposal before making his official budget presentation. He offered <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-jock-tax-will-cover-220-million-for-new-bucks-arena-b99433734z1-289935421.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$220 million</u></a> in state bonding -- essentially a form of borrowing -- toward the cost of the arena. Debt payments on the bonds would be repaid from growth in the so-called &quot;jock tax&quot; -- income tax revenue from Milwaukee Bucks players, employees and visiting teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the $500 million<strong> </strong>would come from the Bucks&rsquo; current owners, the team&rsquo;s former owner -- retired U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl -- and possibly from the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, the growth in jock tax revenue would go to the state&rsquo;s general fund to help pay for things such as schools, roads and other public services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Bucks could leave town in 2017 if a new arena is not in place by the fall of 2017. That is a deadline set by the NBA, which could buy the team back from its owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, without a new Milwaukee arena, there might not be any jock tax revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Walker is proposing a diversion of $220 million from the state&#39;s general fund to the arena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A footnote: Although the headline on the Think Progress article said Walker would spend $500 million on the arena, the article itself did make a reference to his plan for $200 million in bonds.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A slew of tweets<strong> </strong>claimed: &quot;Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&#39;s 2015-&#39;17 state budget does propose cutting $300 million from the University of Wisconsin System over the two-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor also proposes, in the form of bonds, a state contribution for a new Milwaukee arena. But it wouldn&#39;t be $500 million -- the total cost of the arena -- but rather $220 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-tweets-on-scott-walkers-cut-to-colleges-money-for-arena-b99439957z1-290981091.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-05T16:02:03.998074", "ruling_date": "2015-02-06T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker wants to cut college budgets by 13% and spend $500 million for an NBA arena?", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-wants-cut-college-budgets-13-and-spen", "ruling_link_text": "Yes on university funding, but not so much toward arena", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Twitter, tweets stating: &quot;Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium,&quot;
