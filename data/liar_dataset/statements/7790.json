Kennedy&#39;s grave. But then he simply declared to his listeners that it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, in a way, think of who else is there. That is, President Kennedy is buried not far from there, in Virginia,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennedy is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So was Tsarnaev really interred nearby?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted DePetro, he said he wasn&#39;t sure what the distance was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used the <a href=\"http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm\">Google Maps Distance Calculator</a> to find the actual span between <a href=\"http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/VisitorInformation/MonumentMemorials/JFK.aspx\">Kennedy&#39;s grave</a> at Arlington and the <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?q=31058+Sadie+Lane+,+Doswell,+Va.+23047.&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.838178,-77.392029&amp;spn=0.004059,0.005064&amp;sll=38.844884,-77.440788&amp;sspn=0.127548,0.162048&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=31058+Sadie+Ln,+Doswell,+Caroline,+Virginia+23047&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.838178,-77.392029&amp;panoid=h2mB-GQR3wGgenu2BuMNxQ&amp;cbp=12,213.17,,0,3.15\">Al-Barzakh Cemetery</a> on Sadie Lane in Doswell, Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving distance: 87 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bee-line distance: 74 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s about 55,817 <a href=\"http://www.funeralplan.com/askexperts/dimension.html\">casket lengths</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we informed DePetro of the distance and asked if he was still bothered, he wrote in an e-mail, &quot;Yes.
