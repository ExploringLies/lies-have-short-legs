The complaints are broken down into citizen-initiated and department-initiated complaints.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The figures Kriseman cites are accurate for the number of citizen-initiated complaints. The average number of department-initiated complaints also fell from Baker&nbsp;to Kriseman, from 76 to 39.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citizen-initiated complaints have &mdash; for the most part &mdash; been dropping since the beginning of 2001. They average number also decreased during the four-year term of Baker&#39;s successor, Mayor&nbsp;Bill Foster. From&nbsp;January 2010 to January 2014, the average number of citizen-initiated complaints was 41.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked to explain the drop, the police department credited&nbsp;increased communication between residents and police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People understand what we do and why we do it, and our sergeants and frontline supervisors have become more accustomed to explaining why things are done a certain way,&quot; said Maj. Tim Brockman, who has been the Office of Professional Standards commander for two years and with the department for over two decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerns or inquiries are sometimes handled by police before a formal complaint is filed, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holloway has made several moves to implement a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/krise-o-meter/promise/1121/re-establish-community-policing-philosophy/\">community policing philosophy</a>, a Kriseman campaign pledge. Holloway has encouraged officers to leave their cruisers and talk to residents, building relationships with the people the police are serving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, the department started a Park, Walk and Talks program that requires all uniformed officers to walk a patrol area at least an hour a week. Police spokeswoman Yolanda Fernandez said the department has 384 uniformed officers and in the most recent three months of 2017 (April, May and June), there were 5,809 logged walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1990s until 2006, the department&#39;s approach was different: More than 40 officers were each committed to a particular neighborhood.&nbsp;However, former police chief Chuck Harmon, who held the job&nbsp;from 2001 to 2014, said he stopped that initiative amid complaints from the department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One of the things that I found is that community officers were engaging with just a handful of people, and those people were demanding most of their time,&quot; Harmon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harmon also said he became police chief at &quot;tough time&quot; when relationships between the police and community were strained. Before Harmon was hired, Baker had selected Mack Vines to serve as police chief. Vines was fired by Baker&nbsp;after he used the term &quot;orangutan&quot; to describe the actions of a black suspect&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/local/baker-pushed-st-petersburg-toward-change/1061276\">resistance</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we&#39;ll note that law enforcement agencies don&#39;t record complaints the same way, making it difficult to compare St. Petersburg&#39;s practices to other jurisdictions. The Pinellas County Sheriff&#39;s Office takes a very broad look at complaints. Any person who calls in, writes a letter or emails with&nbsp;a concern is counted in the data provided by the department. In 2016, <a href=\"http://pcsoweb.com/Data/Sites/1/media/extra-pdf/2016-command-level-investigations-1-10-17.pdf\">64 members</a> were investigated by a commander within their department&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://pcsoweb.com/Data/Sites/1/media/extra-pdf/2016-formal-investigations-1-10-17.pdf\">44 members</a> were investigated by the administrative division.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St. Petersburg police included&nbsp;investigations by the department&nbsp;and the Office of Professional Standards &mdash;&nbsp;which does not include some of the call-ins that were determined to not be a complaint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman said, &quot;The number of complaints against police officers has decreased on an average when Mr. Baker was mayor from 78 to 14.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers check out for citizen-initiated complaints. The city attributes the decline to increased communication with the community and the police, among other factors. It&rsquo;s worth noting that citizen-initiated complaints for the most part have been declining for the past decade-plus, which might not be apparent in Kriseman&#39;s wording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriseman&rsquo;s claim is accurate&nbsp;but needs additional information. For that reason, we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-02T08:20:30.952036", "ruling_date": "2017-08-02T16:56:31", "ruling_headline": "Have the number of complaints against police dropped under Mayor Kriseman's police chief?", "ruling_headline_slug": "have-number-complaints-against-police-dropped-unde", "ruling_link_text": "Complaints have been going down since 2001", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Jacob Smith, Rick Kriseman&rsquo;s campaign manager, July 25-27 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Major Tim Brockman, the Office of Professional Standards Commander, July 27 and 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, former St. Petersburg Police Chief Chuck Harmon, July 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, St. Petersburg Police Department Records and Evidentiary Services Division Manager Colleen Dunphy, July 26</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Pinellas County Sheriff Director of Communications, Jennifer Crockett, July 31 and August 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchanges, Brigitta Shouppe, campaign spokeswoman for Rick Baker, July 25</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interviews, St. Petersburg Police Department spokesperson Yolanda Fernandez, July 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, city of Orlando, public information officers, July 31</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3901993-SPPD-Complaints-2001-2016.html\">St. Petersburg Office of Professional Standards</a>, complaints 2001-2016, accessed July 26</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/krise-o-meter/promise/1121/re-establish-community-policing-philosophy/\">PolitiFact Florida</a>, Krise-O-Meter: Re-establish a community policing philosophy, April 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "State Representative", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 1440, "last_name": "Kriseman", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "rick-kriseman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rick-kriseman1a.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1440/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.kriseman.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The number of complaints against police officers has decreased from an average when Mr. (Rick) Baker was mayor from 78 to 14.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a mayoral debate", "statement_date": "2017-07-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 137, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/137/", "subject": "Public Service", "subject_slug": "public-service", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Have the number of complaints against police dropped under Mayor Kriseman?"}
