But he also met with the parents concerned about gun issues though not at the originally scheduled time, interviews and photos show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gutierrez and Gallego, who <a href=\"http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/15032387168\">won a term</a> in Congress after spending more than 20 years in the Texas House, appear to be the highest-profile hopefuls <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/politics/article/Early-voting-ends-Friday-for-Senate-District-19-13105779.php\">among eight contenders</a> to serve out more than two years left in <a href=\"https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/local/article/Uresti-gets-12-years-in-prison-13027853.php\">convicted felon</a> Carlos Uresti&rsquo;s term representing <a href=\"https://fyi.capitol.texas.gov/fyiwebdocs/PDF/senate/dist19/m1.pdf\">Texas Senate District 19</a>, which sprawls southwest from San Antonio to the border and west past Alpine and Pecos. The election is July 31, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gutierrez declared in a July 18, 2018, <a href=\"http://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubifi9QXvbDawbcHGJYO3IPFYVAmdrkP39NAAW2NAWg/edit\">campaign email blast</a> that Gallego &quot;in a moment of political cowardice, cancelled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims,&quot; referring to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six staff members dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dec. 14, 2012, massacre occurred 20 days before Gallego began what proved to be one term representing Texas&rsquo; 23rd Congressional District. But a group of victims&rsquo; family members <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/newtown-families-meet-with-obama-six-months-after-shooting/\">met</a> with individual lawmakers in June 2013, about six months into Gallego&rsquo;s term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did Gallego cancel his meeting with shooting victims&rsquo; families?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Postponed by hours?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A web link in Gutierrez&rsquo;s email led us to a June 15, 2013, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newtown-families-washington-background-checks_n_3443977\">Huffington Post news article</a> recapping efforts by victims&rsquo; families and friends to seek a change in law requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Federal law <a href=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/gun-check-explainer/\">requires</a> such checks for purchases from licensed gun dealers but not in private transactions including gun shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Post story indeed says Gallego canceled his meeting with Newtown Action Alliance, a group that <a href=\"https://www.newtownactionalliance.org/about-index#about-us\">describes itself</a> as a &quot;Newtown-based, national grassroots organization&quot; whose mission is to &quot;achieve the steady and continuous reduction of gun violence through legislative and cultural changes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the story says, Gallego&rsquo;s office did not immediately respond to the Post&rsquo;s request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But hold on: An update affixed at the end of the story quotes Erin Nikitchyuk, a mother whose son survived the rampage, saying that Gallego rescheduled and then held his meeting with the group, during which he was &quot;conscientious&quot; and &quot;welcoming,&quot; Nikitchyuk was quoted saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our part, we asked Nikitchyuk about the described meeting through Facebook messages. She <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sHj1B677y6d_0lZnec7oXHNxhh-ZEUn0454jbHHWMCo/edit\">replied</a>: &quot;I absolutely remember meeting with him. In fact, his is the most memorable meeting I had.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikitchyuk subsequently messaged us<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_nVUerYZbGPpa55GJGcWoatEUMXP-h05yJkP0NdSs0A/edit#gid=0\"> the group&rsquo;s itinerary</a> from its trip to Washington, D.C., June 12 and 13, 2013 and showing that family members initially expected to meet Gallego at 9:45 a.m. on Thursday, June 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikitchyuk also connected us with another Alliance member, Kari Hulgaard, who posted to Facebook photos of Gallego in the Alliance-coordinated meeting:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y4nZgi2ZX4sq5sRM7DpWSkzniLHG8GQyg8_tPAAW4ZXJPBqMgbG4FNrXrj9bhwM7rDQxG5CuDWg5kF5jGuCf3cbp-ao-F24otl28OsxNa8Ctn2siRSsDC7kJYujhhkH53b5KLvU7\" style=\"border:none; height:468px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uYWhHEp7ZpAwkeCnbBOZivjbBnSV10QcBqR9XRbJY8_6TSs78BQPqofNlVTkOTiiv9WWCSSx-p7lbOKP1qnBe-xKN8iHOSRj8TJ1eyJxIiJA_57ay_Gw46ubhDNrx7ATvBwAqiS8\" style=\"border:none; height:468px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Photos courtesy of Kari Hulgaard&rsquo;s Facebook page (album titled <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kari.hulgaard/media_set?set=a.10200095623381833.1073741826.1487482612&amp;type=3\">&quot;2013 June Newtown Action Alliance&quot;</a>)</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hulgaard <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200095823226829&amp;set=a.10200095623381833.1073741826.1487482612&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">posted the photos on Facebook</a> June 14, 2013 and made the photos viewable to anyone after we made our inquiries. By text, she told us she wasn&rsquo;t sure if the meeting took place that day or simply later than the originally scheduled &nbsp;9:45 a.m. June 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hulgaard wrote: &quot;Our group was able to spend a generous amount of time with Gallego. He was most endearing and helpful in gaining perspective about how politics work in Texas when it comes to gun violence and gun laws.&quot; Nikitchyuk separately told us that among the meeting attendees were &quot;the brother of one teacher who lost her life and at least one survivor sibling.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallego, asked for his account, said by phone that the meeting singled out by Gutierrez wasn&rsquo;t canceled; it was slightly postponed, he said. Gallego said he ultimately met with &quot;eight to 10&quot; members of the Alliance for &quot;an hour, hour and a half,&quot; he estimated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gallego on changes to gun laws</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did Gallego commit, after meeting family members, to supporting universal gun-purchase background checks?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He did not, according to the Post story, which quotes Nikitchyuk saying, &quot;we clearly do not have his vote on supporting background checks at this time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, she told us by phone that alliance members asked Gallego &quot;where he stands.&quot; According to Nikitchyuk, Gallego responded, &quot;Do you want to know where I stand or how I&rsquo;ll vote? Because they&rsquo;re not necessarily the same thing.&quot; He went on to tell the Alliance they &quot;would need to change the hearts and minds of his constituents,&quot; Nikitchyuk said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Gallego said he didn&rsquo;t remember saying he wouldn&rsquo;t support a bill mandating universal background checks, but did recall talking to the group about <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5946127/ns/politics/t/congress-lets-assault-weapons-ban-expire/\">restoring</a> a federal assault weapons ban. Nonetheless, Gallego said by text that he now believes &quot;if you&rsquo;re buying a weapon--whether at a store or at a gun show or through most private transactions, you should pass a background check.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We alerted Colin Strother, a political consultant to Gutierrez, of the indications that Gallego met with the alliance members; Strother stood by Gutierrez&rsquo;s claim that Gallego had canceled such a meeting. By phone, Strother also noted that Gallego in Congress had an <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/19/us/politics/nra.html?ref=us\">A-level rating from the National Rifle Association</a>, which donated $1,000 to Gallego&rsquo;s congressional campaign in 2014, <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?14952628522\">federal filings show</a>. Strother also told us Gutierrez supports universal background checks and a federal ban on assault weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gutierrez said Gallego as a U.S. House member &quot;canceled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim proved&nbsp;factually incomplete. Interviews and photographs demonstrate that Gallego postponed yet held the meeting at issue. The gathering took place&nbsp;a few hours or possibly a day after it was originally penciled in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is not accurate.
