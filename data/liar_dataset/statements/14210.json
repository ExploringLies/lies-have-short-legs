Districts 23 and 27, both represented by Republicans, and District 35, were held by a Democrat. The court found fault in the district lines in their current forms, but did not order legislators to redraw them. This ruling brought a 2-1 split on the court.

Most recently, the 2017 Legislature revised the voter ID law, in an attempt to alleviate Ramos&rsquo;s concerns that the list of acceptable IDs was too strict, but Democrats argued the reforms were not nearly far-reaching enough. Ramos was expected to issue an updated ruling, taking into account the adopted changes, later in 2017.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/court-texas-house-map-drawn-dilute-minority-voters/6DL4X3uwDEF1zmO7lYvExN/\">April 20, 2017</a>: The pair of federal judges who ruled against Texas in March 2017 decided, in a new case brought by Democrats, that Republican lawmakers in 2011 redrew Texas House districts with the intention of diluting the electoral strength of minority voters in several parts of the state. &quot;The impact of the plan was certainly to reduce minority voting opportunity statewide, resulting in even less proportional representation for minority voters,&quot; according to the court&rsquo;s 2-1 opinion, with Smith dissenting. &quot;Discussions among map drawers demonstrated a hostility to creating any new minority districts, as those were seen to be a loss of Republican seats, despite the massive minority population growth statewide.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The cited rulings looked to us like six instances of federal judges all finding intentional discrimination&nbsp;by the 2011 Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Potential fallout</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That finding, if it sticks, could have significant consequences (though it&rsquo;s also worth keeping in mind that after the 2020 U.S. census, the 2021 Legislature will be expected to redraw districts afresh based on changes in the state&rsquo;s population since 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our inquiry, <a href=\"http://www.lls.edu/faculty/facultylistl-r/levittjustin/\">Justin Levitt</a>, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and former civil rights attorney in the Department of Justice under President Obama, said as little as a single judicial finding of intentional discrimination by Texas lawmakers could fuel a court to reimpose a previous decades-long requirement that any changes in state election law be submitted to the Justice Department or a federal court before taking effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That &quot;preclearance&quot; hurdle went away for Texas and other jurisdictions, mostly southern states, when the Supreme Court in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96\">2012</a> found unconstitutional a provision in the Voting Rights Act specifying when a state or local government must face preclearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Levitt said of Anchia&rsquo;s claim: &quot;If you include intentional discrimination, there&rsquo;s no question the number is six. Six is a giant number when it comes to this. A court only needs one example to suffice, so five or six is a lot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anchia said that six times since 2011, federal rulings&nbsp;found intentional discrimination by the Texas Legislature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We confirmed six such rulings from August 2012 through April 2017 issued by federal judges regarding Republican-drawn U.S. House and Texas House districts or the GOP-driven&nbsp;law requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.
