He knew the people in the super PAC. He knew. I would be willing to bet he wrote the phrase,&quot; a reference to the words that accompanied the nude photograph of Mrs. Trump, a model, posed on a rug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Meet Melania Trump, your next first lady,&quot; the ad said. &quot;Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday,&quot; a reference to the March 22 Utah primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah. He did,&quot; said Trump. &quot;It was his people, who were his friends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this fact-check, we&#39;ll look at whether Trump is correct that Cruz distributed this Facebook ad containing a nude photograph of Trump&#39;s wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zjkN8HdaYIrTQ7dh1yz8-j4TEm5RtpsLHRqxQ9mYQ7J6l5OXjCUzvXzsTHWkAqggP-pHhf6mEP5hr0FiSIVV3LWDr_FX1OcNYKqCQARbGRHz5pab0z31_N5YWkmXF-2tVhyXGTRD\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:441px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:545px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal law says political ads must clearly identify their source, and this one lists the source as a political action committee called <a href=\"http://makeamericaawesome.com/#sthash.6zQyZkW3.hm35fOlA.dpbs\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Make America Awesome</u></a>. Such groups are called super PACs because they can spend limitless amounts of money advocating for or against a candidate or a point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Super PACs have one major restriction: They can&#39;t coordinate their efforts with a candidate&#39;s official campaign, which is restricted in its spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Cruz did arrange for the ad under the auspices of the super PAC, it would be a serious violation of federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The super PAC says . . .</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Cruz campaign had nothing to do with this ad whatsoever. We didn&rsquo;t get the image or the idea for the ad from them,&quot; said Republican strategist Liz Mair, who is behind the super PAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make America Awesome, based in Virginia, was founded in December and reports $20,752 in contributions through February, with most of the money that it spent going to small purchases of air time in nine states, according to the Federal Election Commission website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would guess that including money that has come in since our last filing, we have raised about $35,000,&quot; said Mair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s also no evidence that the PAC is a front for the Cruz campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked the PAC&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCcqH5KHejWp7EREtcpI0Dg\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>YouTube page</u></a>, we found four commercials, only two of which are the standard length for broadcast. The Jan. 20 &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uB7XpY0XOKA\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Buyer Beware</u></a>&quot; commercial, obviously made on a shoestring budget, includes a light-hearted rundown of nine Republican presidential candidates as breakfast cereals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They include Jeb Bush (&quot;Good source of experience and wonkiness. The brand you know.&quot;), Ben Carson (&quot;With extra nice guy doctorness.&quot;), Chris Christie (&quot;100% RDA of telling it like it is.&quot;) and Ted Cruz (&quot;Two Scoops of Conservatism!&quot;). In the ad, the shopper buys the Trump cereal (&quot;Guaranteed success and a free &#39;Screw the Liberal Establishment!&#39; voucher inside&quot;) and ends up regretting the purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mormon women targeted</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only ads we&#39;ve run in favor of any candidate are the three Facebook ads we ran targeting Mormons in Utah and Arizona, of which the Melania one was one, and&nbsp;the one with the least money put behind it (about $300, maybe even less than that, honestly),&quot; Mair wrote&nbsp;in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Melania ad, she wrote, &quot;was targeted only to Mormon women of (if I recall correctly) ages 45-65 living in Utah and Arizona who self-identified as moderate, conservative or very conservative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The shot we used was chosen because of the presence of handcuffs, which was particularly bothersome to the target audience,&quot; Mair said. &quot;However, there are definitely racier shots of her out there that would no doubt be considered more scandalous by a lot of voters across the entire political spectrum &mdash; too racy for us to use in Facebook ads, candidly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the ads urge voters to support the Texas senator, he was only one of two viable alternatives to Trump currently on the ballot in those states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Picture purchased?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a March 27 interview with ABC News, Trump claimed Cruz or his campaign bought the rights to the Melania photo and gave it to the super PAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s no evidence that Cruz, the campaign or Mair&#39;s group purchased rights to the photo, taken when she was Trump&#39;s girlfriend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The image was, at the time we concepted out and then created the ad, already republished all over the Internet at numerous sites,&quot; Mair told us in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photographer who took the image for the&nbsp;2000 photo spread in <em>British GQ</em>, Antoine Verglas, told our friends at FactCheck.org that <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-false-accusation/?platform=hootsuite\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>nobody contacted him</u></a> to buy rights to the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magazine reprinted that photo, along with other pictures from the shoot, <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/donald-trump-melania-trump-knauss-first-lady-erections\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>online</u></a> March 4 under the headline, &quot;The Future First Lady?
