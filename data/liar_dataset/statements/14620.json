It said Aldean addressed the audience before the song to say &quot;people should not own more than one gun,&quot; and blamed the National Rifle Association for the massacre. Aldean did not do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It then gives a real quote from Aldean, who said about shooting victims, &quot;So I want to say to them, &lsquo;We hurt for you, and we hurt with you.&rsquo; But you can be sure that we&rsquo;re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way.
