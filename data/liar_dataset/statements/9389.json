You can read the full text <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/d-day-chain-email/\"><u>here</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the claims about Obama, the email also makes false statements about the D-Day anniversary celebrations in Normandy and the number of American forces involved in the battle. The email is fairly lengthy, so we&rsquo;ll break it down into parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obama is the only American president in the last 69 years who has not visited the D-Day Monument on D-Day. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email claims that since the D-Day invasion in 1944, the United States &quot;has only four times not been there to do the honors.&quot; The language of the email is ambiguous, but we will assume it is referring to &quot;there&quot; as the D-Day Monument in Normandy, rather than also including the monuments in the United States and Britain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are actually only four American presidents who have <a href=\"http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/france\"><u>visited</u></a> the D-Day Monument on D-Day. While Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter and George H.W. Bush all visited France after 1944, they were never there on D-Day. Presidents Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson never went to France at all, according to the State Department. Here are the four who did visit Normandy on D-Day anniversaries:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?57476-1/40th-dday-anniversary\"><u>Ronald Reagan</u></a> attended commemorative ceremonies and delivered the 40th anniversary address in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/7llXClvoozw\"><u>Bill Clinton</u></a> gave a speech at the 50th anniversary in 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the 60th anniversary in 2004, <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/06/20040606.html\"><u>George W. Bush</u></a> delivered an address in Normandy with French President Jacques Chirac. Previously in 2001, Bush spoke at the <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010606-2.html\"><u>dedication</u></a> of the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford, Virginia. And in 2002, he spoke at an <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/05/20020527-1.html\"><u>event</u></a> in Normandy on Memorial Day, but it was not associated with D-Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the fourth president to speak on D-Day? <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-d-day-65th-anniversary-ceremony\"><u>President Barack Obama</u></a>, at the 65th anniversary ceremony in 2009, where he dedicated the new visitor center at the U.S. Military Cemetery in Normandy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email lists events from Obama&rsquo;s schedules on June 6 of 2010, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/schedule/president/2011-06-06\"><u>2011</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/schedule/president/2012-06-06\"><u>2012</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/schedule/president/2013-06-06\"><u>2013</u></a>, and it&rsquo;s correct when it says Obama was not at the D-Day anniversary in Normandy in those years. But the email omits mention of the year he was present at the anniversary -- 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making the email&rsquo;s claim even more ironic is that Obama is <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/05/09/obama-vladimir-putin-d-day-normandy-france-russia-ukraine/8896169/\"><u>scheduled to attend</u></a> the upcoming 70th anniversary on June 6, 2014 -- which means he would be the only U.S. president to ever visit the D-Day Monument on D-Day twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For comparison, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/dday.asp#qrFQx3RmtydIbCgT.99\"><u>Snopes.com reported</u></a> that George W. Bush had no public events connected to D-Day in<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/schedule/complete/2013-06-06\"> </a><a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/\"><u>2008</u></a>,<a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/06/\"> <u>2007</u></a>,<a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/06/\"> <u>2006</u></a>,<a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/06/\"> <u>2005</u></a>,<a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/06/\"> <u>2003</u></a>, or<a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/06/\"> <u>2002</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Every year the French have a four-day celebration in Normandy complete with American uniforms, tanks, jeeps and guns. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email is largely correct in stating that the French host a celebration in Normandy every year, but it is not necessarily 4 days long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, in 2004, the <a href=\"http://www.the70th-normandy.com/la-normandie/retour-sur-le-60eme/\"><u>60th anniversary</u></a> of D-Day was remembered with a 3-day celebration that included 17 official ceremonies between June 5 and 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, 2014, marks the 70th anniversary -- possibly the last decennial anniversary for those who took part in or witnessed the battle. To commemorate this event, Normandy is hosting a <a href=\"http://www.the70th-normandy.com/the-70th/the-70th-anniversary-of-d-day-and-the-battle-of-normandy/?lang=en\"><u>3-month long celebration</u></a>, from June 5 to August 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>D-Day was &quot;the largest invasion ever attempted, where 200,000 Americans stormed the beaches at Normandy&quot; and 6,000 soldiers died.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that the invasion of Normandy was the <a href=\"http://www.dday.org/history/d-day-the-invasion/overview\"><u>largest</u></a> land, air and sea operation in the history of warfare. However, the email&rsquo;s numbers are off when it comes to the troops and casualties involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roughly 156,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy on D-Day, but only 73,000 of those were Americans, not 200,000, as the email states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email also says 6,000 Americans died on D-Day, but this mistakes total <em>casualties </em>for deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/d-day/d-day-and-the-battle-of-normandy-your-questions-answered#troops\"><u>D-Day Museum</u></a> in Britain defines casualties as all losses suffered by the armed forces, including those killed, wounded, missing in action and prisoners of war. There is no official casualty figure for D-Day because of the lack of accurate records, but it is estimated that there were 6,603 American casualties. The U.S. National D-Day Memorial Foundation has recorded the names of individual Allied troops killed on D-Day, verifying 2,499 American fatalities -- not 6,000, as the email says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chain email said that Barack Obama is the only American president who has not visited the D-Day Monument in Normandy on D-Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This long-circulating email was always wrong -- presidents Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama himself had indeed visited the monument in Normandy on D-Day -- but it&rsquo;s especially wrong now, with Obama scheduled to visit the monument again on D-Day 2014, making him the only president to visit it twice on D-Day.
