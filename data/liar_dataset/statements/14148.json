Pretty good hustle, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except it&rsquo;s not true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it&rsquo;s true that NASA does perform <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/analogs/envihab/bed-rest-faqs\">bed rest studies</a>. The goal is to examine the potential effects of weightlessness on astronauts, and lying in bed with your head tilted down at a six-degree angle is apparently a fair substitute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The studies sound pretty much as described at TheSolExchange.com &mdash; except for the cannabis part. Several media outlets like the<em> <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/article/NASA-needs-volunteers-to-stay-in-bed-for-15-weeks-4821188.php?cmpid=hpfc\">Houston Chronicle</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/crossingborders/2013/09/18/nasa-will-pay-18000-to-watch-you-rest-in-bed-for-real/#5a3903157c55\">Forbes</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nasa-patient-8179-100\">Vice</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/need-some-time-off-your-feet-nasa-paying-volunteers-18k-to-lie-in-bed-for-70-days/\">CBS News</a> have written in the past about the studies, which involve people getting paid something on the order of $1,200 per week for 15 weeks (that&rsquo;s $18,000) to hang out in bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not all that great of a time, from the sound of it. Boredom is a constant problem, as every moment of a volunteer&rsquo;s life is spent in bed for that time. Scientists continually poke and prod them, taking readings and measurements on everything from weight to bone density. Volunteers are told when and what to eat, and have to do everything in bed. That means eating, exercising, showering and even, yes, using the facilities while lying down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A NASA spokesman told us that there have not been any sleep studies that involved consuming cannabis. There also aren&rsquo;t any more sleep studies currently planned, so it&rsquo;s not like NASA is suddenly going to try it the next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog posts that have been saying that NASA is paying subjects $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke marijuana for 70 days are pretty far out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only lighting up we see here is when we rate this Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-23T17:49:35.062830", "ruling_date": "2017-05-24T09:37:37", "ruling_headline": "Persistent story about NASA paying people $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke ganja is fake", "ruling_headline_slug": "persistent-story-about-nasa-paying-people-18000-li", "ruling_link_text": "Lots of lounging, but no cannabis", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>TheSolExchange.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://thesolexchange.com/nasa-will-pay-you-18000-to-stay-in-bed-and-smoke-weed-for-70-straight-days/\">NASA Will Pay You $18,000 To Stay In Bed And Smoke Weed For 70 Straight Days</a>,&quot; Jan. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Forbes</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/crossingborders/2013/09/18/nasa-will-pay-18000-to-watch-you-rest-in-bed-for-real/#d56f9007c558\">NASA Will Pay $18,000 To Watch You Rest In Bed &mdash; Really</a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Houston Chronicle</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/article/NASA-needs-volunteers-to-stay-in-bed-for-15-weeks-4821188.php?cmpid=hpfc\">NASA needs volunteers to stay in bed for 15 weeks straight</a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/need-some-time-off-your-feet-nasa-paying-volunteers-18k-to-lie-in-bed-for-70-days/\">Need some time off your feet?
