And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that what happened? Basically, yes. Kimmel has a point that by approving the increase, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress rebuked Trump&rsquo;s proposal and made clear a distaste for cutting NIH. Budget experts, however, may quibble that Kimmel oversimplified a bit on the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, some background. NIH <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/mission-goals\">conducts and disseminates research</a> into the causes, diagnosis, prevention&nbsp;and cure of human diseases. It is a collection of <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/list-nih-institutes-centers-offices\">27 separate institutes and centers</a>, such as the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining Kimmel&rsquo;s comment starts with the release earlier this year of the Trump White House&rsquo;s budget blueprint. While this proposal did not offer significant detail, it did include a cut for NIH. Specifically, the proposal would reduce spending for fiscal year 2018 by $5.8 billion compared to the fiscal 2017 level, through a range of reorganizations, consolidations and other changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s short of a $6 billion cut, as Kimmel described it, but it&rsquo;s pretty close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast-forward a few weeks to congressional negotiations over a bill to keep the government funded and avoid a government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-strike-budget-deal-to-fund-government-through-sept-30/article/2621731\">agreement</a> reached by lawmakers, NIH would see a $2 billion increase in its budget over the five-month period of extended federal spending. (That&#39;s on top of the funding that was already expected.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/01/nih-funding-congress-trump/\">news reports</a>, the agreement provides an additional $400 million for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and an additional $476 million for the National Cancer Institute, $120 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, and an additional $110 million for the BRAIN Initiative, which aims to map the human brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where Kimmel oversimplified matters is on the numbers. Specifically, the $2 billion increase did not directly replace Trump&rsquo;s $5.8 billion proposed cut -- the two actions are distinct, since they targeted two different fiscal years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have been more accurate to say that the $2 billion increase directly rejected a <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/28/budget-nih-cuts/\">separate Trump proposal</a> to cut $1.2 billion from NIH for the remainder of fiscal 2017, which concludes at the end of September. (Remember, the $5.8 billion cut was to be for the 2018 fiscal year, not for the rest of 2017.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the Trump proposal to cut NIH by $5.8 billion in 2018 is still officially on the table since Congress hasn&rsquo;t yet acted on spending for 2018. The agreement Kimmel cited only addresses a five-month extension of federal spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Kimmel&rsquo;s overarching point -- that Congress effectively rejected Trump&rsquo;s proposal to cut NIH -- is on target, experts say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Ellis, vice president of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed that while Kimmel oversimplified the numbers, he added that the talk show host&rsquo;s &quot;overall message is accurate. The administration sought cuts and Congress boosted the funding.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the decision to protect NIH in the budget has been supported not just by Democrats but also by key Republicans, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/01/nih-funding-congress-trump/\">including</a> the chairmen of the two chambers&rsquo; health appropriations subcommittees, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., as well as Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no appetite on the Hill for cutting NIH,&quot; Stan Collender, a budget expert at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kimmel said, &quot;President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically, the two funding changes Kimmel referenced are for different fiscal years, so Congress didn&rsquo;t precisely exchange the increase for Trump&rsquo;s proposed cut. But Kimmel&rsquo;s broader point is solid: The move by Congress to increase, rather than decrease, NIH&rsquo;s funding for the rest of the 2017 fiscal year is a signal that lawmakers are in no mood to cut NIH&rsquo;s budget by $5.8 billion once the 2018 spending bills are taken up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-03T14:46:51.055512", "ruling_date": "2017-05-03T17:08:59", "ruling_headline": "Jimmy Kimmel largely right about cuts, additions to NIH budget", "ruling_headline_slug": "jimmy-kimmel-largely-right-about-cuts-additions-ni", "ruling_link_text": "On the big picture, he's right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Jimmy Kimmel, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pob55ARI-nk\">full monologue on YouTube</a>, May 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf\">America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again</a>,&quot; accessed May 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institutes of Health, <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-1\">summary of annual appropriations</a>, accessed May 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institutes of Health, <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/mission-goals\">about the institutes page</a>, accessed May 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institutes of Health, <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/list-nih-institutes-centers-offices\">list of institutes and centers</a>, accessed May 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Examiner</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-strike-budget-deal-to-fund-government-through-sept-30/article/2621731\">Lawmakers strike budget deal to fund government through Sept. 30</a>,&quot; April 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stat, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-strike-budget-deal-to-fund-government-through-sept-30/article/2621731\">NIH to get a $2 billion funding boost as Congress rebuffs Trump&rsquo;s call for cuts</a>,&quot; May 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stat, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/28/budget-nih-cuts/\">White House proposes new, sweeping budget cuts at NIH,</a>&quot; March 28, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stat, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/16/trump-budget-science-research/\">Trump budget calls for slashing biomedical and science research funding</a>,&quot; March 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, May 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Stan Collender, budget expert with the firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, May 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, May 3, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Host of ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jimmy", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "California", "id": 3926, "last_name": "Kimmel", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "jimmy-kimmel", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kimmel_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3926/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health.
