In the  contest between the two Democrats for attorney general, candidate Rob  Teilhet is using his time under the Gold Dome to try to claim an  advantage over his opponent, Ken Hodges.<br /><br />Elected four consecutive  times since 2002 to serve a portion of Cobb County in the Georgia  Legislature, Teilhet said in a questionnaire that he \"represented\" the  entire state.<br /><br />\"As the only Democratic candidate (for attorney  general) who has represented the entire state of Georgia, I'm uniquely  positioned to introduce and implement groundbreaking public policy  designed to curtail crime, consumer fraud and public corruption,\"  Teilhet wrote.<br /><br />We were curious about this one. Teilhet explained.<br /><br />\"You  are elected to represent a district, but you also serve the state of  Georgia,\" he said.<br /><br />Teilhet pointed us to the oath of office for  the 180-member state House of Representatives.<br /><br />Here's the first  part of the oath: \"I do hereby solemnly swear or affirm that I will  support the Constitution of this state and of the United States and, on  all questions and measures which may come before me, I will so conduct  myself, as will, in my judgment, be most conducive to the interests and  prosperity of this state.\"<br /><br />So does Teilhet represent the entire  state as he claimed?<br /><br />Teilhet was elected by voters from a portion  of east Cobb County that includes Marietta, Smyrna and the Dobbins Air  Reserve Base. He has been in the Legislature since 2003. The Hodges camp  duly noted the boundaries of Teilhet's district as part of its argument  against his claim.<br /><br />\"It's the first line in his campaign bio,\"  Shannon Marietta, Hodges' campaign manager, wrote in an e-mail.<br /><br />Hodges,  who served 12 years as Dougherty County's district attorney, had to  pledge that he would support the Georgia Constitution.<br /><br />The state  constitution says representatives should be elected from \"representative  districts of the state.\" They have the power to write local legislation  and the mandate to approve a balanced budget. They do not have the  power to approve contracts or regulate charges for public utilities.<br /><br />Teilhet  worked with other House members on about two dozen pieces of  legislation earlier this year that were designed to have an impact  across the state, such as a bill to take DNA samples of people accused  of felonies -- that bill failed. A handful focused on issues that were  of particular interest to Cobb residents, such as a bill imposing up to  20 years in prison for theft in a disaster area. Cobb County was hardest  hit during September's record flooding. He also wrote about a dozen  resolutions that ranged from commending the county manager, David  Hankerson, to honoring the South Cobb High School marching band for  performing at President Barack Obama's inauguration.<br /><br />George  Hooks, whose 20 years in the Georgia Senate is longer than that of any  of his colleagues, said lawmakers have dual roles of representing the  district and constituents across Georgia. Sometimes, Hooks said, he  supports legislation that people in his South Georgia district may not  like, but it benefits the state, such as a bill earlier this year that  could offer new funding sources for transportation.<br /><br />\"I voted for  it because I see it as benefiting the state,\" Hooks said. \"If it  benefits Atlanta, it will benefit the state.\"<br /><br />University of  Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, whom Teilhet said  was one of his college professors, said some representatives work as  \"trustees,\" serving the interests of everyone. Others act as  \"delegates,\" taking care of the people in their home district.<br /><br />Steve  Anthony, who has worked at the state Capitol and is a lecturer at  Georgia State University, believes Teilhet is \"playing loose with  verbiage.\" <br /><br />\"If he had said he represented the interests of the  state of Georgia, he would be correct,\" Anthony said. \"He didn't  represent Georgia. He represented the interests of Georgia.\"<br /><br />Anthony  also took issue with the second part of Teilhet's statement, saying the  candidate cannot introduce legislation as attorney general. \"He can get  some friend to introduce it for him.\"<br /><br />Teilhet replied: \"By that  standard, the governor has never introduced a bill.\"<br /><br />Teilhet and  others have different interpretations about the role of members of the  Georgia House of Representatives. The state constitution does not say  whether representatives are elected to serve the entire state. The oath  does say that representatives should work toward goals that are  \"conducive to the interests and prosperity of this state.\" <br /><br />Teilhet  said he has talked on the campaign trail about the oath of office  directing representatives to serve the interests of the state. \"Maybe  that would have been a little tighter [to say in the questionnaire],\"  Teilhet said. We agree that Teilhet would have been better served if he  said he represented the \"interests\" of the state. As even Hooks said,  Teilhet's statement is \"broad.\" We rate Teilhet's statement as Barely  True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
