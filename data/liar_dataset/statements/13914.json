The bill still has several hurdles before it reaches Gov. Rick Scott&rsquo;s desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill&rsquo;s sponsor, Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, argued at a March 27 House subcommittee <a href=\"http://thefloridachannel.org/videos/32717-house-justice-appropriations-subcommittee/\">hearing</a> that the courts will ultimately have to rule on whether the legislation is constitutional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on some court decisions, Eagle said it is &quot;unclear if non-citizens can enjoy the same constitutional rights as citizens&quot; although he said that everyone is entitled to <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=2017s0120.acj.DOCX&amp;DocumentType=Analysis&amp;BillNumber=0120&amp;Session=2017\">constitutional protections for due process</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Francesca Menes, director of policy and advocacy for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, disagreed with Eagle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As an undocumented immigrant, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States,&quot; she said, &quot;and that has been said over and over in the courts, that they do have constitutional rights.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that undocumented immigrants do have constitutional rights -- but not all of the rights of citizens. (We have previously fact-checked a claim about whether unlawful presence in the United States is not a crime, a claim we ruled <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/mar/15/florida-conference-catholic-bishops/being-united-states-unlawfully-crime/\">Mostly True</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some rights, but not all</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Florida Immigrant Coalition pointed to an <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/immigration/255281-yes-illegal-aliens-have-constitutional-rights\">article</a>&nbsp;by an author of immigration books about constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We interviewed several legal scholars who agreed that undocumented immigrants have many constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, and if arrested, a right to a Miranda warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no question that all persons in the United States including unauthorized migrants enjoy the protections of the Constitution,&quot; said Gabriel (Jack) Chin, law professor at University of California-Davis. &quot;There is no debate about that among legal scholars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fifth Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment protects everyone from deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law, Chin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been several court decisions <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/18/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-legality-birthright-citizenship-not/\">dating back</a> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2017/01/30/does-the-constitution-protect-non-citizens-judges-say-yes/#2b5c6aeb4f1d\">more than a century</a> that outline the rights of undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <em><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-7791.ZS.html\">Zadvydas vs. Davis</a></em> (2001) that &quot;once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the due process clause applies to all persons within the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Texas case, <em><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/sep/25/david-watts/1982-supreme-court-decision-texas-case-said-public/\">Plyler vs. Doe</a>,</em> the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that non-citizen children must get a free K-12 education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But undocumented immigrants don&rsquo;t share all of the rights held by citizens -- for example, they can&rsquo;t vote in state and national elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Fordham law professor Jennifer Gordon said that some undocumented immigrants get almost no due process in removal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996, Congress created expedited removal for undocumented immigrants without a hearing. Initially it only applied at the U.S. border. Then it was expanded to within 100 miles of a border for undocumented immigrants who had been in the country less than 14 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Donald Trump announced in January that his administration will apply the program anywhere in the United States to undocumented immigrants present less than two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the past, the government has largely prevailed when such programs have been challenged,&quot; Gordon said. &quot;However, the Trump administration is proposing to expand some of these programs to include many more undocumented immigrants; it remains to be seen if the expansion will be upheld.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule by June on whether undocumented immigrants in custody for deportation proceedings have a bond right to a hearing if their cases haven&rsquo;t been dealt with in a timely manner. The ACLU filed the case on behalf of immigrants detained for more than six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While defendants in criminal proceedings have a Sixth Amendment right to a government-appointed attorney if they are poor, that right doesn&rsquo;t extend to immigration court, where the violations are considered civil and not criminal, said Cornell law professor Stephen W. Yale-Loehr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, immigrants do have constitutional rights, but those rights are not equal to U.S. citizens,&quot; he said. &quot;They have due process rights, but when it comes to immigration court proceedings, those rights are often watered down by courts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, said that although undocumented immigrants have constitutional rights, the question with the Florida law is whether it &quot;intrudes into the federal regulatory scheme.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When ruling on a case involving <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/apr/13/jan-brewer/former-arizona-gov-jan-brewer-claims-states-immigr/\">Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law</a>, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states can&#39;t enhance penalties for immigration violations but can ask for immigration status or ask the federal government to verify a suspect&#39;s status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now, if the bill punishes criminal felonies, not immigration infractions, giving harsher punishments to illegal aliens, then I think it would be vulnerable to an equal protection challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment,&quot; Shapiro said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Menes, speaking on behalf of the Florida Immigrant Coalition said, &quot;As an undocumented immigrant, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Undocumented immigrants have many constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and religion. But they don&rsquo;t share all the constitutional rights of citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, some undocumented immigrants in removal proceedings have not gotten due process in court, and they don&rsquo;t have a right to a government-paid lawyer in immigration court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-28T16:19:57.372805", "ruling_date": "2017-03-29T15:08:13", "ruling_headline": "Do undocumented immigrants have constitutional rights?", "ruling_headline_slug": "do-undocumented-immigrants-have-constitutional-rig", "ruling_link_text": "Many rights, but not all of them", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Florida Channel, <a href=\"http://thefloridachannel.org/videos/32717-house-justice-appropriations-subcommittee/\">House Justice Appropriations Subcommittee</a>, March 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida House, <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=56696&amp;SessionId=83\">HB 83</a>, filed Dec. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Senate, <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=h0083b.JUA.DOCX&amp;DocumentType=Analysis&amp;BillNumber=0083&amp;Session=2017\">Staff analysis of SB120</a>, February 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lobby tools, <a href=\"http://public.lobbytools.com/index.cfm?type=bills&amp;id=42775#summary\">Summary of HB 83</a>, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill</em>, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/immigration/255281-yes-illegal-aliens-have-constitutional-rights\">&quot;Yes, illegal aliens have constitutional rights,&quot; </a>Sept. 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2017/01/30/does-the-constitution-protect-non-citizens-judges-say-yes/#6ff38b594f1d\">&quot;Does The Constitution Protect Non-Citizens?
