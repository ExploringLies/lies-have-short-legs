Rick Scott.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist has vowed to protect abortion rights and fight for equal pay for women for months. Scott has attacked Crist for taking money from <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2014/10/gov-rick-scott-is-up-with-a-new-ad-that-echoes-a-claim-his-campaign-has-failed-to-get-much-traction-that-charlie-crist-has.html#more\">strip club owners</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-1saGudoRE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">TV ad</a> attacks Scott&rsquo;s record on funding rape crisis centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No one saw it coming. With the stroke of a pen, Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers. Scott said the centers weren&#39;t needed. But they&rsquo;ve helped over a million Florida women who&rsquo;ve been sexually assaulted get care, counseling and legal help. These centers were a place for women who have nowhere else to turn. And Rick Scott turned his back on every single one of them.&quot; (Technically the Florida Democratic Party released the ad, but the Crist campaign has promoted it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad leaves viewers with the impression that Scott completely rejected funding for rape crisis centers, a serious attack against the governor. Did Scott veto funding for 30 rape crisis centers and say that the centers weren&rsquo;t needed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scott&rsquo;s veto</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state funds rape crisis centers through various pots of money. A portion comes from the <a href=\"http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/prevention/sexual-abuse-or-violence-prevention/index.html\">Rape Crisis Trust Fund</a>, which comes from fines assessed on felony criminal defendants. Additionally, some money comes from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, and in some years the Legislature and governor approved additional money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fine print, the ad cites a TV report from April 2012. In 2012, Scott vetoed $1.5 million of additional money for the rape crisis centers. The 30 centers still received $1.4 million from the Trust Fund and $500,000 from the attorney general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Council Against Sexual Violence, which lobbies on behalf of the centers, issued a <a href=\"http://www.fcasv.org/publications/newsletters/rape-crisis-centers-address-media-governor%E2%80%99s-funding-veto\">statement</a> criticizing the veto, &quot;especially when the need for increased funding is so clear, waiting lists for core services are growing, and programs can&rsquo;t meet the needs of those whose lives have been devastated by sexual violence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott&rsquo;s veto during Sexual Assault Awareness Month drew much scrutiny -- especially in <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/rick-scotts-sense-irony\">left-leaning</a> <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/24/1085960/-For-Sexual-Assault-Awareness-Month-Rick-Scott-vetoes-funding-for-Florida-s-rape-crisis-centers#\">websites</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TV ad says &quot;Scott said the centers weren&rsquo;t needed&quot; but that&rsquo;s not actually a reference to a direct quote by Scott. We found no statement by Scott to suggest he thought the centers were unnecessary -- only that he thought the new funding wasn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Crist campaign points to a statement by Scott&rsquo;s spokesman at the time, Lane Wright, who told the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/23/rick-scott-florida-govern_n_1447294.html\">Huffington Post</a>, &quot;This new funding of $1.5 million would have been duplicative, since, as a state, we already fund sexual violence programs. There was no information suggesting any needs in this area weren&rsquo;t already being met.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott, while attending an event for Crime Victims Rights Week, said he thought the centers were adequately funded, not that they were unnecessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have increased funding for domestic violence. We have money that goes into rape crisis centers already,&quot; Scott said, according to a column in the <em><a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional/cerabino-gov-scott-has-way-of-backing-causes-whack/nN3R3/\">Palm Beach Post</a></em>. &quot;So it was additional money that was already funded.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scott later recommended an increase in funding</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s more to the story, though. Advocates for the rape crisis centers met with state staff after the veto, and the next year Scott recommended additional money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There were a number of people in the Legislature who spoke with the governor&rsquo;s office about the need, and in 2013, there it was in his recommended budget,&quot; said Jennifer Dritt, director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violent, who spoke with PolitiFact Florida in September. &quot;We were never in any governor&rsquo;s recommendation for funding until Gov. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott highlighted his funding boost for rape crisis centers in a 2013 <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/governor-scott-florida-families-first-budget-invests-in-keeping-florida-families-and-visitors-safe-2/\">press release</a>, which included praise by Dritt: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This appropriation will make a world of difference in the lives of Florida&rsquo;s citizens, and we&rsquo;re grateful for his commitment,&quot; Dritt said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increase in money allowed some centers to hire additional staff which helped reduce waiting lists and expand services, Dritt told PolitiFact Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Scott, the $2.5 million remained in the budget for a second year in a row in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on our interviews with women&rsquo;s advocates and state officials in September, here is the amount of state dollars that went to rape crisis centers statewide under Crist and Scott:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Legislative session</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Money from state AG (usually from general revenue)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Other general revenue</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Trust Fund</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Total</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2007-Crist</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$400,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.5 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.9 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2008-Crist</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$400,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2.4 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2009-Crist</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$250,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2.25 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010-Crist</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$250,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.8 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2.05 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011-Scott</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$250,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.8 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2.05 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012-Scott</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$500,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0 after Scott vetoed $1.5 million approved by Legislature</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.4 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.9 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013-Scott</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$500,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2.5 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.3 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$4.3 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2014-Scott</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$500,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2.5 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1.3 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$4.3 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TV ad on behalf of Crist said &quot;Rick Scott vetoed funding for 30 Florida rape crisis centers.
