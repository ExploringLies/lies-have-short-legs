Citizenship check. Photo ID.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kemp&rsquo;s video stretched the facts. Courts dismissed lawsuits filed by Kemp to change voting procedures in Georgia &mdash; after the Obama administration allowed the voting changes. Also, there&rsquo;s no indication that Obama wanted immigrants in the country illegally voting.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Kemp&rsquo;s evidence</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Kemp&rsquo;s campaign pointed to preclearance lawsuits filed on Georgia&rsquo;s behalf in June and November of 2010 against then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of its <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-4-voting-rights-act#bailout_list\">history of voter discrimination</a>, Georgia was one of several states whose voting changes were required to be precleared by either&nbsp;a federal court or the U.S. Justice Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Per <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act\">Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, in judicial reviews, jurisdictions must establish that proposed voting changes do not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. If jurisdictions seek administrative preclearance from the Justice Department, they can implement voting&nbsp;changes if the Attorney General affirmatively indicates no objection, or if&nbsp;at the expiration of 60 days, no objection to the submitted change has been interposed by the Attorney General.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both of Georgia&rsquo;s lawsuits dealt with new rules to prevent people in the country illegally from casting votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first lawsuit concerned a voter verification process that required information on voter registration applications to match data kept by Georgia&rsquo;s Department of Drivers Services and the Social Security Administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other lawsuit stemmed from a Georgia law requiring proof of citizenship from individuals registering to vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, both lawsuits were dismissed because the&nbsp;Justice Department approved the changes through the administrative process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/voting-determination-letter-58\">did</a> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_KEK8-LWmzhM2I5OWI2NGUtOTU3Ny00NjQ0LWJlMGEtMDJlMTA5ZTFiODJk/view?ddrp=1&amp;hl=en#\">oppose</a>&nbsp;one of the changes Georgia sought, but later found no objection after the state revised it. So, Kemp and the Justice Department eventually were on the same side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As secretary of state, Brian Kemp sued the Obama Justice Department twice &mdash;&nbsp;and won &mdash; to implement Georgia&#39;s common sense citizenship check and Photo ID laws,&quot; said Ryan Mahoney, Kemp&#39;s campaign spokesman.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New voter verification procedures were <a href=\"http://gareport.com/story/2010/08/23/doj-gives-clearance-for-voter-verification-procedures/\">initially sought</a> by former Secretary of State Karen Handel, who attempted to implement them before the 2008 general election. (She <a href=\"http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/local/article29067286.html\">resigned in 2009</a> and is now in the U.S. House.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Justice Department in 2008, under Republican President George W. Bush, &quot;first questioned&quot; the voter verification process, saying federal law requires states to verify a voter&#39;s identity, but not citizenship, the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/justice-department-approves-georgia-voter-verification-system/m0QiK4qiePSmQyVVOYV2XP/\">reported</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The state largely acted as it was required to by the Voting Rights Act, as has been necessary since the law was signed into law in 1965,&quot; said Barry C. Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. &quot;In both of the Georgia cases, the Department of Justice precleared the changes after reviewing them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael S. Kang, a law professor at Emory University School of Law, said &quot;it&rsquo;s odd&quot; to claim that Kemp &quot;fought Obama twice&quot; on the basis of the 2010 lawsuits, since the Justice Department ultimately chose to preclear both voting changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In fact, many election law experts were surprised that the Justice Department under President Obama didn&rsquo;t maintain an objection to these laws,&quot; Kang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the ad creates the wrong impression that Obama wanted people in the country illegally to vote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But &quot;there is zero evidence to support the implication that the Obama administration wanted to see illegal immigrants voting,&quot; Burden said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kang said he is unaware of any serious evidence that &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; were voting in Georgia at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I also do not believe that President Obama has supported voting by &lsquo;illegal immigrants,&rsquo; &quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Kemp said he &quot;fought Obama twice and won to stop illegal immigrants from voting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facts don&#39;t suppport Kemp&#39;s assertion. The Obama administration allowed Georgia&rsquo;s changes to stop noncitizens from voting to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As secretary of state, Kemp was required to seek approval for the changes from the Justice Department or a federal court. He got it from the Justice Department, so the lawsuits were dismissed. Experts described the process as routine under the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is flat-wrong to suggest&nbsp;that the Obama administration wanted immigrants in the country illegally to cast votes in elections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim&nbsp;False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-21T12:09:56.814223", "ruling_date": "2018-03-21T15:51:18", "ruling_headline": "Did Brian Kemp fight Obama twice 'to stop illegal immigrants from voting'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "Did-Brian-Kemp-fight-Obama-twice-to-stop-illegal", "ruling_link_text": "Lawsuits required part of the process", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BrianKempGA/videos/10155429420636275/\">Post on Brian Kemp&rsquo;s page</a>, March 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Brian Kemp&rsquo;s press office, March 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Justice Department, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-4-voting-rights-act#bailout_list\">Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, Updated Dec. 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Justice Department, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act\">About Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, Updated Dec. 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Justice Department, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/jurisdictions-previously-covered-section-5\">Jurisdictions previously covered by Section 5</a>, Aug. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Justice Department, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/voting-determination-letter-58\">Voting Determination Letter sent to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert E.
