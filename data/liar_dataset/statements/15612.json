Putin said following a one-on-one meeting with Trump in Helsinki, Finland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, for his part, appeared to take his Russian counterpart at his word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Putin says it&#39;s not Russia,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I don&#39;t see any reason why it would be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the U.S. intelligence community, House and Senate panels led by Republicans, the special counsel&rsquo;s team and members of Trump&rsquo;s own administration have endorsed the view that Russia has interfered in American politics, in a practice that dates as far back as the Soviet era.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As we wrote in our story naming the 2017 <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/12/2017-lie-year-russian-election-interference-made-s/\">Lie of the Year</a> &mdash; Trump&rsquo;s claim that Russian election interference is a &quot;made-up story&quot; &mdash; a mountain of evidence points to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a January 2017 <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf\">assessment</a>, the CIA, FBI, NSA and Director of National Intelligence &mdash; referred to as the the intelligence community &mdash; concluded that Russia intervened to help Trump&rsquo;s election chances while hurting those of Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intelligence agencies have said the Kremlin directed the cyber-theft of private data, the placement of propaganda against particular candidates, and an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Senate panel that independently reviewed the intelligence community&rsquo;s assessment backed up its findings, <a href=\"https://www.burr.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SSCI%20ICA%20ASSESSMENT_FINALJULY3.pdf\">concluding</a> July 3 that the agencies&rsquo; joint assessment was a &quot;sound intelligence product.&quot; The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/377566987/Intel?secret_password=jNYBm8bsLoUUE3HkzV5k#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">said</a> Russia conducted cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions during the 2016 campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh evidence of Moscow&rsquo;s election interference emerged in indictments stemming from the special counsel&rsquo;s investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 13, Mueller <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\">charged</a> 12 Russian intelligence officers for their role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign, and subsequently leaking stolen emails and documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this latest indictment, the special counsel alleged that units operating under Moscow&rsquo;s military intelligence agency conducted cyber operations that involved &quot;the staged releases of documents&quot; obtained through targeted computer hacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These units conducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election,&quot; the indictment states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, the special counsel <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\">charged</a> 13 Russians and three Russian entities with conspiring to defraud the United States and interfere with the 2016 presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of Trump&rsquo;s own administration have endorsed a view at odds with the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then-CIA director Mike Pompeo &mdash; now secretary of state &mdash; <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/359913-cia-director-stands-by-russian-interference-assessment\">said</a> in November 2017 that he stands by the intelligence community&rsquo;s January 2017 findings that Russian cyber-meddling sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Mueller&rsquo;s first indictment against Russian hackers in February, Trump&rsquo;s then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/h-r-mcmaster-incontrovertible-evidence-of-russian-interference-in-election/\">called</a> the evidence of Russia&rsquo;s interference in the 2016 presidential election &quot;incontrovertible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dan Coats, Trump&rsquo;s top intelligence official, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/intelligence-director-coats-says-u-s-under-attack-putin-targeting-2018-elections/332566002/\">told</a> lawmakers in February, &quot;There should be no doubt that (Putin) views the past effort as successful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coats, the director of National Intelligence, also issued a stern warning days before Trump&rsquo;s meeting with Putin in Helsinki. He compared the current threat of more Russian cyberattacks to warning signs before the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was in the months prior to September 2001 when, according to then-CIA Director George Tenet, the system is blinking red,&quot; Coats said. &quot;And here we are nearly two decades later, and I&#39;m here to say, the warning lights are blinking red again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The history of Russian meddling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In light of Putin&rsquo;s blanket denial, we took a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/jun/20/richard-burr/heres-every-time-russian-or-soviet-spies-tried-int/\">fresh look</a> at Russia&rsquo;s election-meddling past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historians said the 2016 election was the first known example of a Russian attempt to sway a U.S. election in favor of a specific candidate, though there could have been additional attempts that remain classified or undiscovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If by &lsquo;Russia&rsquo; one means post-1991 Russia, that statement (from Putin) appears to be correct based on publicly available information,&quot; said Lucan Way, a University of Toronto professor specializing in democratization and authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that does not mean the 2016 meddling was unprecedented. Way noted that Russia has frequently interfered in the elections of post-Soviet countries since the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the Soviet Union worked in secret to help or hurt U.S. candidates at least four times during the Cold War era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What we are seeing with Russia&#39;s active measures today are &lsquo;unprecedented&rsquo; in that they use new tools and technologies &hellip; but the ends are very much older, and are straight from the KGB playbook,&quot; said Calder Walton, an expert in intelligence history and international relations at Harvard University&rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government. &quot;One can&#39;t understand Russian active measures to interfere in the 2016 election without understanding the long KGB history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1960, for example, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered Adlai Stevenson assistance from a secret propaganda campaign. Stevenson <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-adlai-stevenson-stopped-russian-interference-1960-election-180961681/\">declined the offer</a> and ultimately lost in the Democratic primary to John F. Kennedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1968, Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, offered to secretly fund for Hubert Humphrey&rsquo;s campaign against Richard Nixon, but Humphrey <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2017/01/10/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-mark-kramer\">rejected</a> the bribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1976, the KGB opened a smear campaign against anti-communist Democrat Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/31/books/secrets-from-the-lubyanka.html\">forging FBI paperwork</a> to make it seem that Jackson was gay and distributing the fake reports to U.S. newspapers both during and after the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Walton said Soviet interference efforts became most active in the 1980s against Ronald Reagan, pointing to a now-public cache of top-secret KGB records called the <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.chu.cam.ac.uk_news_2014_jul_7_mitrokhins-2Dkgb-2Darchive-2Dopens_&amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;c=imBPVzF25OnBgGmVOlcsiEgHoG1i6YHLR0Sj_gZ4adc&amp;r=Yg_qrQW8IcJ8HtI-toNw-WVZ3ju2ZsNQ0c1ljSgvjWc&amp;m=TjXv0fdO_MwxnPGarxNExg_pNrCvEQG3wTORT7uS44s&amp;s=Veu94mH1JyJfrolJhkLXowBepV70_VVQu5_RvcfpnrU&amp;e=\">Mitrokhin Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KGB <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/science-and-technology/active-measures-a-history-of-russian-interference-in-us-elections\">sought</a> compromising material on Reagan in 1976 and planted some anti-Reagan articles in foreign newspapers. Ahead of the 1984 election, the KGB also worked to discredit Reagan&rsquo;s policies and popularize the slogan &quot;Reagan Means War&quot; around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is a long history of the Kremlin interfering in internal U.S. affairs, including elections,&quot; Walton said. &quot;This included gathering compromising material on U.S. politicians, supporting Kremlin-favored candidates in U.S. elections, spreading forgeries and disinformation campaigns to inculcate distrust among the U.S. population in their government and Western allies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walton added that Putin&rsquo;s claim is &quot;nonsense.&quot; We&#39;ve reached out to the Russian embassy and will update the fact-check if we hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Putin said, &quot;The Russian state has never interfered ... into internal American affairs including election process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mountain of evidence testifies to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community and a Republican-led Senate panel concluded independently of each other that Kremlin-directed operatives stole private data, used propaganda against particular candidates, and engaged in an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. A Republican-led House panel found in its own investigation that Russia conducted cyberattacks during the 2016 campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These findings are supported by indictments stemming from the special counsel&rsquo;s investigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no public evidence to suggest that the post-Cold War Russian government had previously interfered in a U.S. election at levels near the 2016 meddling, but the Soviet Union made several attempts to do so prior to its collapse in 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-16T16:07:21.208997", "ruling_date": "2018-07-16T16:56:37", "ruling_headline": "Vladimir Putin falsely claims Russia never interfered in American politics", "ruling_headline_slug": "vladimir-putin-falsely-claims-russia-never-interfe", "ruling_link_text": "Making a molehill out of a mountain", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/12/2017-lie-year-russian-election-interference-made-s/\">&quot;2017 Lie of the Year: Russian election interference is a &#39;made-up story,&#39;&quot;</a> December 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prospect Magazine, <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/science-and-technology/active-measures-a-history-of-russian-interference-in-us-elections\">&quot;Active measures&quot;: a history of Russian interference in US elections,&quot;</a> December 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/05/russia-has-been-meddling-in-foreign-elections-for-decades-has-it-made-a-difference/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f32d85b47232\">&quot;Russia has been meddling in foreign elections for decades.
