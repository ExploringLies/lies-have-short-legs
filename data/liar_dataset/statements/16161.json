Rick Scott&rsquo;s immigration policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is our family, but if Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida,&quot; said the narrator. &quot;He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S. Families belong together. Rick Scott turned his back on ours.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two Democratic groups, Priorities USA Action and the Senate Majority PAC, paid for the ad and placed it on a Facebook page, Nuestra Florida, which translates to Our Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott, a Republican two-term governor, is <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/elections/2018/2018-us-senate/\">challenging Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lead-in text above the video offers a hint that the reference was to past statements by Scott (emphasis ours): &quot;Rick Scott vowed to implement racial profiling laws in Florida and wanted to exclude Dreamers from citizenship.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this attack amounts to cherry-picking. Scott softened his stance on illegal immigration years ago and does not have those positions anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Did Scott encourage racial profiling of immigrants?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This attack is misleading. The fine print shows it is in reference to a position Scott took during a GOP primary in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video cites a sentence from a 2010 <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019138_2019132_2028023,00.html\">TIME magazine article</a> about the Florida 2010 governor&rsquo;s race. It says, &quot;Scott favors Arizona&rsquo;s draconian anti-illegal-immigration law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/730/bring-arizonas-immigration-law-florida/\">Scott did promise</a> then to bring a law similar to Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 to Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2010 Arizona law made being an undocumented immigrant a state crime and required legal immigrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status. <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/latest/naacp-joins-legal-challenge-to-arizona-racial-profiling-law-2/\">Critics</a> said it would lead to racial profiling, prompting state officials to add to the law that police &quot;may not consider race, color or national origin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-immigration-arizona-status-illegal/\">argued in 2010</a> that the law wasn&rsquo;t racial profiling and said, &quot;I clearly don&#39;t believe in racial profiling.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Scott never pushed for such a law after he was elected, breaking <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/730/bring-arizonas-immigration-law-florida/\">his promise</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Priorities USA Action said the result shouldn&rsquo;t matter to people who saw the Facebook post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We say that he vowed to implement laws like Arizona,&quot; Priorities USA Action spokesman Josh Schwerin said. &quot;Just because he didn&rsquo;t get it done doesn&rsquo;t mean he didn&rsquo;t pledge to do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf\">U.S. Supreme Court </a>found parts of the Arizona law unconstitutional but upheld the central requirement calling on officers to check the status of people they suspect were undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Exclude Dreamers from citizenship?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This attack zeroes in on Scott&rsquo;s statements against Dreamers early in his tenure. It, too, ignores that his more recent position is more favorable to this group of immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dreamers are immigrants brought over to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just weeks before he took office, Scott spoke against a DREAM Act bill in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m against the Dream Act,&quot; he <a href=\"https://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2010/12/say-no-to-dream-act-rick-scott-says-in-miami.html#ixzz1g39P54qc\">said</a> in December 2010. &quot;Why? I don&#39;t believe in amnesty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, Scott <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/2013/06/04/governor-rick-scott-vetoes-hb-235/\">vetoed a bill</a> to let Dreamers get driver&rsquo;s licenses. Scott criticized the Obama administration&rsquo;s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals as a policy &quot;absent congressional direction.&quot; (DACA allowed these illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status &mdash; Trump later rescinded it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott also <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/oct/20/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-bill-give-drivers-licenses-daca-im/\">argued that the Florida driver&rsquo;s license bill was unnecessary</a> because those with a federal employment authorization card could already obtain a temporary driver license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in 2014 as he was seeking re-election, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/may/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-opposed-state-tuition-dreamers-he-embra/\">in-state tuition</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was a <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/may/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-opposed-state-tuition-dreamers-he-embra/\">Full Flop</a> from 2011 when he said &quot;with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2017, when Trump was deciding whether to dismantle DACA, Scott issued a statement saying, &quot;I do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These kids must be allowed to pursue the American Dream, and Congress must act on this immediately,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He elaborated on his point in a January 2018 <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/01/16/comprehensive-reform-congress-should-just-secure-dreamers-immigration-status-rick-scott-column/1034169001/\">USA Today</a> calling for Congress to &quot;secure the immigration status of Dreamers,&quot; a reference to Trump saying he would extend protections to Dreamers. Scott called on Congress to &quot;do the right thing for these kids by removing the uncertainty hanging over their future goals and dreams.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While an extension of deferred action is not the same as citizenship, it is clear that Scott moderated his view and became more open to Dreamers having a way to legally stay in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A Facebook ad by Democratic groups said, &quot;If Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ad leaves viewers with the misleading impression that these are current Scott policies. Neither is true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott did promise in 2010 to bring Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law to Florida. Immigration advocates feared the law would lead to racial profiling. Once Scott was elected, he never pursued the idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott was a bit more active in his earlier opposition to allowing Dreamers to stay in the country, but that has also changed. He publicly objected to Obama&rsquo;s deferred action program for people who came into the country illegally as children, saying Obama bypassed Congress. Scott also vetoed a bill to give Dreamers driver&rsquo;s licenses. But in 2014, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition and in the past year he has spoken in favor of helping Dreamers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, the ad creates a misleading impression that Scott is anti-immigrant by only drawing on part of his record. We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-02T11:19:40.537930", "ruling_date": "2018-11-02T16:21:56", "ruling_headline": "Democrats' attack on Gov.
