Charlie Crist  vetoed the bill, former Florida House Speaker and Republican U.S. Senate  candidate Marco Rubio promptly released a statement that \"Gov. Crist&rsquo;s veto also  clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida.\"<br /><br />The statement, however,  is based on a misleading assumption about the <a href=\"http://democrats.senate.gov/reform/patient-protection-affordable-care-act-as-passed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">national health care law</a>.<br /><br />First, a few words  about the federal law. It will create state-run health insurance exchanges in  which private companies will compete for the business of people who do not get insurance through their employers. The idea is that it will allow  individuals to get group rates enjoyed by those in big employer plans. People  who cannot afford insurance will get government subsidies to offset the cost of  purchasing a plan in the exchange. <br /><br />How to deal with abortion in the health care  exchanges predictably became a thorny political issue that threatened the law's  very passage, and several alternatives were considered. The final language signed into law, crafted by abortion  opponent Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., will allow insurance companies in the exchange  to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. <br /><br />But Nelson's provision  specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in  the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance  companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool  of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans  that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums  into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would  have to be drawn from that segregated account.<br /><br />The national health care law also gives states an  opt-out. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans  offered on the state exchange if they chose. That's what <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/sections/bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=43887&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=64&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=1143&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\" target=\"_blank\">Florida's HB 1143</a> attempted to do. <br /><br />Section 101 of the  bill states, \"A health insurance policy or group health insurance policy  purchased in whole or in part with state or federal funds through an exchange  created pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may  not provide coverage for an (elective) abortion ... A policy is deemed to be  purchased with state or federal funds if it is a policy toward which any tax  credit or cost-sharing credit is applied.\"<br /><br />Again, Crist vetoed that bill.<br /><br />But the rhetoric on  this issue can be tricky. For example, Florida House Republicans were right when  they said in a press release after Crist's veto that \"Recent federal health care  legislation gave states the opportunity to opt-out of federal provisions using  tax dollars ... to subsidize insurance plans that fund elective abortions.\" Yes,  the federal law would allow tax dollars to subsidize someone's policy even if  the individual chose a plan that covers abortion. And so it would certainly be  fair to say that many women who cannot currently afford health insurance will be  given tax subsidies and many of them may choose plans that offer abortion  services. <br /><br />But the  House Republicans' release was wrong when it said the law would \"force Florida  taxpayers to pay for elective abortions.\" Any abortions would be paid through a  separate account funded entirely through a portion of premiums paid by people  who select a plan that covers abortion services, not from tax dollars. That's an  important difference. Everyone who buys into a plan that covers abortion would  have to pay into that abortion fund, even men. And for those with moral  objections to paying a portion of their premiums for abortion services, the  federal law requires that every region offer at least one alternative health  plan that does not cover abortion.<br /><br />Before signing off on the abortion language in the  national health care bill, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich, persuaded President Barack  Obama to issue an executive order providing a way to ensure two checks go to  insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not  commingled. And Stupak, who up until that point had been the champion of the  abortion foes' position, declared, \"There will be no public funding for abortion  in this legislation.\" <br /><br />We agree. That was the case before Crist vetoed the  Florida bill. And it's true after. <br /><br />Abortion foes argue the federal rules are little more  than an accounting trick, that if federal subsidies go to someone who chooses a  plan that covers abortion, it's the same as taxpayer-funded abortion. But we  think it's misleading to call it taxpayer-funded abortion when the law requires  abortions be paid solely through a portion of the premiums (not tax dollars)  paid by people who choose a plan that covers abortions.<br /><br />We rule Rubio's  statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-14T14:21:12.693096", "ruling_date": "2010-06-14T19:51:33", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio claims Gov.
