But there&rsquo;s evidence it&rsquo;s a fake news outlet however, not the least of which is that the site insisted to a commenter questioning the story that &quot;this is real, it was on TV.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We received no response when we tried to contact the administrator via the Gmail address the site provided. The site is registered to someone in <a href=\"https://www.whois.com/whois/ilovenativeamericans.us\">Kosovo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story falsely quoted Trump in a bogus Fox News interview as saying, &quot;I&rsquo;ve seen it in all kinds of TV documentaries. Horrible attacks on good Americans using hatchets or bows and arrows. You can&rsquo;t trust these Indians.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also included are two images of tweets, allegedly from Feb. 13. The tweets are actually fakes. As all devoted PolitiFacters know, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/mar/14/fake-140-characters-how-not-get-tripped-hoax-twitt/\">quite easy to fake a tweet from any account</a>, and Trump is a popular target. There&rsquo;s no record of Trump actually tweeting such things about Native Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the story itself came from a parody site called The-Postillon.com, which <a href=\"http://www.the-postillon.com/2017/02/trump-to-deport-indians.html\">first posted the article on Feb. 13</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The-Postillon.com calls itself &quot;honest news&quot; on its banner, but its <a href=\"http://www.the-postillon.com/p/faq.html\">FAQ section notes</a> that &quot;everything you can read here is satire and therefore all made-up.&quot; Unlike many parody sites, the FAQ also lists several staffers, and gives readers explicit permission to repost edited articles with attribution.
