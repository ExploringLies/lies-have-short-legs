Bob McDonnell stands accused of sanctioning the biggest tax hike in Virginia history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe charge has been lodged by Jamie Radtke, a Virginia Tea Party organizer, in protest of the General Assembly&rsquo;s approval last month of a transportation plan that could raise annual taxes by $1.25 billion a year. McDonnell backed the legislation and hailed its passage as &quot;an historic day in Virginia.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill is sitting on McDonnell&rsquo;s desk and Radtke is trying to pressure the governor not to sign it. She has started a Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Stopvirginiataxhike\">page</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/r.php?profile_id=547106201990394&amp;next[%00*%00protocol]=http&amp;next[%00*%00isGenericURI]=0&amp;next[%00*%00domain]=www.facebook.com&amp;ne\">petition</a> called &quot;Stop Largest Tax Increase in Virginia History.&quot; She also <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/11/ads-running-in-primary-states-target-mcdonnell-tar/\">narrated</a> a TV <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nj7ZnRmBdo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">ad</a> claiming that McDonnell, who many believe has national ambition, &quot;pushed the largest tax increase in Virginia history.&quot; The commercial was sponsored by the conservative <a href=\"http://www.patriotsuperpac.com/\">Patriot Super PAC</a> and aired in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses every four years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll of this leads to an obvious question: Does the transportation bill call for the largest tax increase in Virginia history? We checked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe package would generate $880 million a year in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hac.state.va.us/Committee/files/2013/HB2313/HB2313%20Transportation%20Conference%20Report%2002-21-13.pdf\">new</a><a href=\"http://hac.state.va.us/Committee/files/2013/HB2313/HB2313%20Transportation%20Conference%20Report%2002-21-13.pdf\"> state revenues</a> in 2018 when it is fully phased in, according to a report by the House Appropriations Committee. About $680 million of that sum would come from tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation would replace the current 17.5-cent per-gallon gas tax with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level. It would raise the 5 percent sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle tax sales tax to 4.3 percent. It also counts on Congress passing legislation that would give states authority to compel online retailers to collect sales tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise a total of <a href=\"http://hac.state.va.us/Committee/files/2013/HB2313/Regional%20Sources%20-%20HB%202313%20Transportation%20Package.pdf\">$568 million</a> a year for transportation by 2018.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen you combine the new tax revenues for the state with the potential new levies flowing into&nbsp;Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, the tax package comes to about $1.25 billion a year<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Radtke to back up her claim that it all adds up to Virginia&rsquo;s largest tax increase. &quot;I&rsquo;m slammed and don&rsquo;t have time to pull all that for you right now,&quot; she replied in a March 5 email. Radtke added that former Gov. Mark Warner &quot;had the biggest tax increase in 2004, which was $1.4 billion over two years. This one is $1 billion every year. I will see if I can get you more data later.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke never got back to us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that Warner&rsquo;s 2004 tax increase, often described as record-breaking when it passed, originally generated about $700 million a year. So in terms of raw dollars, Radtke has a point: This year&rsquo;s take hike, with a potential of producing $1.25 billion annually for state and local coffers, would set a high-water mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Radtke may not have chosen the most meaningful way to compare financial data from different points in time. &nbsp;Several analysts urged us to account for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe followed their advice and found that Warner&rsquo;s tax hike, in today&rsquo;s dollars, comes to about $860 million a year. That still falls below the $1.25 billion potential of the bill that awaits McDonnell&rsquo;s signature. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWarner, however, &nbsp;is not the only governor in Virginia history who pushed through a tax increase that can be compared to the current plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1986, Gerald Baliles signed a package of tax hikes that raised $422 million for transportation. Adjusted for inflation, it comes out to $893 million in 2013 dollars. That doesn&rsquo;t beat this year&rsquo;s bill, either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we got a different result when we went back to 1966 and examined landmark legislation signed by Gov. Mills Godwin that created the state&rsquo;s sales tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation phased in a 3 percent state sales tax over about three years to aid public education, help create Virginia&rsquo;s community college system and pay for some transportation and administrative expenses. In addition, the law allowed counties and cities to enact a 1 percent sales tax, and all localities did that, according to a <a href=\"http://www.coopercenter.org/sites/default/files/autoVANLPubs/Virginia%20News%20Letter%201970%20Vol.%2046%20No.%208.pdf\">1970 publication</a> by the University of Virginia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new levies brought in $282 million during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1970, according to a report that year by the Department of Taxation. Adjusted for inflation, that comes to $1.68 billion today and easily outpaces the tax increase that McDonnell has endorsed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke said that the transportation package approved by the General Assembly this year amounts to the largest tax increase in Virginia history. Using raw dollars, she&rsquo;s correct. But that&rsquo;s not the whole story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe value of a dollar changes over time. When inflation is factored, the value of legislation approved in 1966 that created the state&rsquo;s sales tax would be $1.67 billion annually today. That exceeds the $1.25 billion-a-year potential of this year&rsquo;s bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That makes it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-15T12:48:26.338074", "ruling_date": "2013-03-15T12:38:15", "ruling_headline": "Jamie Radtke says transportation bill would impose \"largest tax increase in Virginia history\"  ", "ruling_headline_slug": "jamie-radtke-says-transportation-bill-would-impose", "ruling_link_text": "Not when inflation is considered", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tEmail from Jamie Radtke, March 5, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia House Appropriations Committee, <a href=\"http://hac.state.va.us/Committee/files/2013/HB2313/HB2313%20Transportation%20Conference%20Report%2002-21-13.pdf\">&quot;HB 2313 conference report,&quot;</a> Feb. 21, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia House Appropriations Committee, <a href=\"http://hac.state.va.us/Committee/files/2013/HB2313/Regional%20Sources%20-%20HB%202313%20Transportation%20Package.pdf\">&quot;HB 2313 conference report regional transportation sources,&quot;</a> accessed March 12, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Virginia Slaughter, spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Taxation, March 12, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Ric Brown, Virginia&rsquo;s finance secretary, March 1, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, March 11, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John Knapp, senior economist at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, March 11, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails from John Knapp, March 11, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Larry Sabato, political scientist at the University of Virginia, March 4, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGov.
