Our students will not be as successful if we don&rsquo;t have the best and brightest in those classrooms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered whether URI&rsquo;s salaries are really that low relative to other public higher education institutions. If they are, Dooley&rsquo;s contention that the salaries make URI less attractive to prospective faculty members makes sense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile waiting for the university&rsquo;s media relations department to get back to us on the source of Dooley&rsquo;s claim, we searched for information and data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Chronicle of Higher Education, a news source about colleges and universities, maintains a salary database on its website based on annual surveys by the American Association of University Professors, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe AAUP&rsquo;s most recent survey, for the 2011-12 fiscal year, collected salary information for 1,251 higher education institutions around the country. The survey broke down the average salaries by position: full professor, associate professor, assistant professor, and, where applicable, instructor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the survey, the national average for full professors is $113,176; for associate professors, it&rsquo;s $78,565; for assistant professors, $66,564; and instructors, $47,847.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the University of Rhode Island, the average for full professors is $105,200; for associate professors, it&rsquo;s $78,900; for assistant professors, the number is $65,800; and for instructors, it&rsquo;s $58,600.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be clear, in his statement, Dooley was comparing URI with the other flagship state universities in New England. This is a small group that excludes private institutions and smaller public colleges, such as Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBesides URI, the list includes the University of Connecticut, the University of Massachusetts system, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Vermont and the University of Maine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Chronicle database, UConn, the four UMass campuses and the University of Vermont all had higher average salaries for each teaching level than URI. The University of Maine&rsquo;s average salaries were all lower.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tData for the University of New Hampshire was missing from the 2011-12 survey. A spokeswoman for the AAUP told us UNH did not respond to a request for salary information. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we called UNH, a spokeswoman said the faculty union may not have provided the information because it&rsquo;s in the midst of a contract dispute with the university and is working under the terms of an expired contract. Erika Mantz, director of media relations, gave us the current average salaries for UNH faculty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn summary, these are the average salaries for full professors at each institution in order from highest to lowest: UConn ($139,100), UMass Amherst ($122,600), UMass Lowell ($120,100), UNH ($115,800), UMass Boston ($115,700), UMass Dartmouth ($111,200), the University of Vermont ($113,800), URI ($105,200) and the University of Maine ($95,000). <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo URI does indeed rank second from the bottom in the region. And for each of the other categories, it occupies the same place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen David Lavallee, a spokesman for URI, got back to us, he provided data that the provost&rsquo;s office took from the 2010-11 AAUP salary survey. We confirmed that in that year, URI also had the second-lowest average salaries in New England.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDooley said that faculty salaries at URI are the lowest among public universities in New England except for the University of Maine. According to a national survey, he&rsquo;s correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoreover, although salaries for lower-level faculty at URI are comparable to national averages or better, salaries for full professors are 7 percent lower than the national average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Dooley&rsquo;s statement True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
