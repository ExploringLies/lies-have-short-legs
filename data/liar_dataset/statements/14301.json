Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to her retirement after the 2014 midterm elections, Bachmann, a social conservative, was known for making controversial statements. So it may not come as a surprise that, more than two years after her retirement, she&rsquo;s still being used by clickbait purveyors, banking on the anger of liberal social media users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/\">article</a> noted by Facebook users, from the site USPOLN.com, is headlined, &quot;Bachmann: &lsquo;White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oddly, the words that the headline attributes in quotation marks to Bachmann do not appear in the subsequent article. But the &quot;quotes&quot; provided discuss similar themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article quotes Bachmann as saying, &quot;I don&rsquo;t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what&rsquo;s been done to white conservative Americans in the past eight years of Obama&rsquo;s presidency. Because, let&rsquo;s face it, during that time, we&rsquo;ve had the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we&rsquo;ve had countless terrorist attacks, we&rsquo;ve had many racial killings and crimes and we&rsquo;ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America&rsquo;s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I&rsquo;m guessing he does.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we go any further, it would be an opportune time to note that USPOLN.com is, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/06/blog-posting/its-fake-news-president-can-disband-supreme-court/\">as we have noted</a> previously, contains a <a href=\"http://uspoln.com/about-us/\">disclaimer</a> in the &quot;about us&quot; tab that reads, &quot;USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don&rsquo;t necessarily exist. These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, not a word of this &quot;story&quot; should be believed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this isn&rsquo;t just fake news. It&rsquo;s old fake news. (Perhaps the focus on Obama should have been a clue to its timing -- he&rsquo;s been out of office for six months now.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that an essentially identical article <a href=\"http://religionlo.com/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/\">appeared</a> as early as Aug. 23, 2016, on the website Newslo, which bills itself as a mix of true and fake news. With the click of a button, you can see what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you click on the button, the part about Bachmann&rsquo;s comments on slavery falls into the &quot;fake&quot; category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moral of the story: Liberal dislike of Bachmann has survived her retirement so strongly that it is able to carry multiple iterations of clickbait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website USPOLN.com said in a post that Bachmann had said, &quot;White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.&quot; Not only is USPOLN.com an acknowledged &quot;satirical&quot; site, but the post originated in August 2016 on another acknowledged purveyor of articles that it admits are partially fake. We rate the item Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-10T17:58:21.652811", "ruling_date": "2017-07-14T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "No, Bachmann didn't say whites suffered more under Obama than blacks during slavery", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-bachmann-didnt-say-whites-suffered-more-under-o", "ruling_link_text": "Fake ... and a clickbait retread", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>USPOLN.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/\">Bachmann: &lsquo;White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery,</a>&rsquo; &quot; July 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USPOLN.com, <a href=\"http://uspoln.com/about-us/\">disclaimer</a>, accessed July 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newslo, &quot;<a href=\"http://religionlo.com/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/\">Bachmann: &quot;White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery</a>,&rsquo; &quot; Aug. 23, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Website", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Uspoln", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3887, "last_name": "Website", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "uspoln", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/uspoln_logo.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Pennsylvania", "edition": "Pennsylvania", "edition_slug": "pennsylvania", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 54, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Pennsylvania Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/54/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3887/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://uspoln.com"}, "statement": "<p>Says former Rep.
