Andrew M. Cuomo says tax rates will drop for the middle class as long as they remain high for the rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As state budget talks begin to heat&nbsp;up, that is his pitch for extending what&rsquo;s called the millionaires&rsquo; tax - an 8.82 percent income tax on those earning more than $1 million annually. That rate will fall to 6.85 percent if the tax is not extended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The additional tax bracket was created under former Gov. David Paterson and then extended by Cuomo and the Legislature in 2013. It&#39;s due to sunset at the end of this year. But Cuomo wants to extend it for another three years. In return, he promises lower taxes for the middle class.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We want to start right out of the box by doing an additional tax cut for the middle class because the best thing we can say to our middle-class brothers and sisters is, &#39;You know what, government is going to take less of your paycheck every week.&#39; &quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics say Cuomo is misleading the public. They say the tax cuts Cuomo is talking about were already passed in last year&rsquo;s budget. Those rates are scheduled to be <a href=\"http://bit.ly/29EaluL\">the lowest</a> in 70 years when phased in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Senate says drop the millionaires&rsquo; tax. Assembly says raise the millionaires&rsquo; tax. I say, continue it as is,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;I also propose in my budget a middle income tax cut. But if you allow the millionaires&rsquo; tax to expire, that $3.5 billion&nbsp;loss of revenue devastates the budget. And forget all the proposals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, which is it? Are there new tax cuts in Cuomo&rsquo;s budget, or were they already passed last year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A promise or threat?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that state tax rates for the middle class are slated to go down. Last year&#39;s budget included tax cuts for married filers making between $27,750 and $321,050, as well as for single filers making between $13,850 and $214,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cuts are scheduled to be phased in from 2018 through 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"380\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KTxwBiIMixKg9zeYYaEKNAeTeIDrdqMEZwvVcNCnovw/pubchart?oid=1287874843&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"710\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Cuomo&rsquo;s proposed <a href=\"https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/executive/eBudget1718/fy18artVIIbills/REVENUEArticleVII.pdf\">budget legislation</a>&nbsp;doesn&#39;t contain any additional cuts. It extends the millionaires&#39; tax through 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Cuomo administration spokesman says that still counts as a tax cut this year. Without an extension of the millionaires&rsquo; tax, last year&#39;s cuts could be amended or eliminated to balance the books, the spokesman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s not the governor fighting for a middle-class tax cut. That&rsquo;s the governor threatening to take away a middle-class tax cut,&quot; said Ken Girardin of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility&nbsp;and effective and accountable government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo&rsquo;s budget proposal won&rsquo;t change anything for the middle class compared to last year&rsquo;s agreement, Girardin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The legislature could take a one-year hiatus to Saint Lucia and middle-class tax rates would still go down,&quot; Girardin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo said he&rsquo;s proposing &quot;an additional tax cut for the middle class&quot; in this year&rsquo;s budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tax rates in Cuomo&rsquo;s proposed budget are not new. They were approved in last year&rsquo;s budget&nbsp;but are not scheduled to begin until 2018. Middle-class tax rates will decline as scheduled if lawmakers leave them alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granted, everything is up for negotiation in a state budget, including tax rates. Legislative leaders could agree to change tax rates as part of this year&rsquo;s spending plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Cuomo&rsquo;s statement ignores facts and gives a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-16T16:24:11.415056", "ruling_date": "2017-03-17T18:10:38", "ruling_headline": "Cuomo's budget does not include new tax cuts", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuomos-budget-does-not-include-new-tax-cuts", "ruling_link_text": "We compared to last year", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gov.
