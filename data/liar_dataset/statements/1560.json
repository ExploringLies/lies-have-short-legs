It was 62 for women,&quot; said Beck. &quot;Wait a minute, when did benefits come in? At 65.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis point was that Social Security was not meant to benefit as many people as it does today. Indeed, Beck went on to say that if Roosevelt had passed the law now, the starting age would be around 80 years old, due to longer life expectancy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wondered if Beck was right about life expectancy in the 1930s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndeed, he was correct. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency that tracks birth and death data, says that a man born in 1935, on average, lived until he was 60; a woman typically lived until she was 64. So Beck&#39;s claims of 58 and 62 were just off slightly. And Beck was correct that an average person would die before Social Security took effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about Beck&#39;s implication that the age was chosen purposefully so that the majority of Americans would never recieve their Social Security benefits? Was FDR making this calculation?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProbably not, said Edward Berkowitz, a professor on Public Policy at the George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security. &quot;I think that the age was chosen somewhat at random, certainly not to hedge actuarial bets.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBerkowitz thought that an alternative explanation for the age choice was that the Germans had a similar program that the Americans used as a model. Berkowitz also pointed out that the median age might not reflect real life expectancy because the number was skewed by a large share of infant deaths. &quot;After you survive infancy, life expectancy goes up.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, we can&#39;t be sure what FDR was thinking, but for our purposes, Beck&#39;s statement is off by just a couple of years and his overall point is right that life expectancy was below the retirement age of 65. That&#39;s close enough to earn a True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-08T10:02:17.871527", "ruling_date": "2010-03-08T10:03:42", "ruling_headline": "Glenn Beck gets numbers on Social Security and life expectancy correct", "ruling_headline_slug": "Glenn-Beck-Social-Security-life-expectancy", "ruling_link_text": "People didn't live as long back then", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Centers for Disease Control, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/nvsr52_14t12.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;National Vital Statistics Report Vol. 52 No. 14&quot;</a>, p. 34, Feb. 18, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glenn Beck, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/glennbeck/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Glenn Beck Program</a>, Feb. 16, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail interview with Edward Berkowitz, Professor of Public Policy at The George Washingotn University, Feb. 17, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Glenn", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "", "id": 181, "last_name": "Beck", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "glenn-beck", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Glenn.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/181/", "total_count": 31, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When Social Security started, age expectancy for the average man was 58.
