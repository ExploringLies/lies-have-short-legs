State Rep. Leo Berman of Tyler called Democratic President Barack Obama &quot;God&#39;s punishment on us&quot; April 24. And this week, Gov. Rick Perry suggested the April 20 British Petroleum oil rig explosion on the Gulf Coast could have been an &quot;act of God.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry, <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/293293-1\" target=\"_blank\">speaking Monday at a governors conference</a> about job creation sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, warned that banning offshore drilling could hurt the economy. &quot;From time to time, there are going to be things that occur that are acts of God that cannot be prevented,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCritics howled that Perry was dismissing the situation&#39;s seriousness. A day later, Perry defended the comment. He told reporters: &quot;Here&#39;s what I said, and I think it&#39;s an interpretation issue with one reporter, is what I think. If you will go look up the definition of &#39;act of God,&#39; we&#39;ve used it in legal terms for a long time in this state and the &mdash; nobody knows what happened, and I said that in my remarks, that there were, you know, a lot of speculation. It could have been an act of God, it could have been, you know, who knows?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTexas law works in mysterious ways?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBarron&#39;s Law Dictionary defines &quot;Act of God&quot; as the &quot;manifestation of the forces of nature which are unpredictable and difficult to anticipate; &#39;the result of the direct and immediate and exclusive forces of nature, uncontrolled or uninfluenced by the power of man and without human intervention, [which] is of such character that it could not have been prevented or avoided by foresight or prudence.&#39; Examples are tempests, lightning, earthquakes and a sudden illness or death of a person.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe legalese dates back to Roman law, and judges have since continued to rule that an act of God doesn&#39;t depend on divine influence. In 1609, a British court ruled that a fire caused by lightning was an act of God. In 1785, a court ruled a fire not caused by lightning wasn&#39;t, according to a 1996 article in the American Journal of Public Health.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSteve Bickerstaff, an adjunct law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that when someone who has previously expressed a strong religious affiliation &mdash; like Perry &mdash; calls an oil rig explosion an act of God, it sounds like that person is suggesting the disaster is celestial retribution. Bickerstaff said: &quot;My first reaction was, &#39;Oh, no &mdash; we&#39;re back to God taking revenge on us. But, actually, the term act of God has very prominent historical significance, very commonly used in contracts.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBickerstaff concurred that the term has had historic uses in Texas and the United States, and it&#39;s in most contracts, particularly between big businesses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTake a house knocked down by an earthquake. Did someone cause that? &quot;Well, if they didn&#39;t build the house adequately according to code and requirements, then yes,&quot; Bickerstaff said. &quot;But the earthquake itself is an act in which they have no control.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd the oil rig explosion? No way to know yet, Bickerstaff said. &quot;Was the company negligent? Was it BP, or the company operating the rig? I don&#39;t know. Was the system flawed in some way? We don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe&#39;re not endeavoring to judge, so to speak, whether the rig explosion was an &quot;act of God.&quot; That said, we quickly found several state laws that use the phrase.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s illegal for a railway company to obstruct a street, railroad crossing or public highway for more than five minutes, but &quot;it&#39;s a defense to the prosecution under this section that the train obstructs the street, railroad crossing or public highway because of an act of God or breakdown of the train,&quot; according to a transportation law that took effect in 1995.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn insurance carrier isn&#39;t liable to pay for an employee&#39;s injury if, among other exceptions, the injury &quot;arose out of an act of God, unless the employment exposes the employee to a greater risk of injury from an act of God than ordinarily applies to the general public,&quot; according to a 1993 law about workers&#39; compensation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn agriculture-related law that took effect in 2003 protects people who violate rules about artificially controlling the weather if they can prove the violation &quot;was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe.&quot; A law enacted in 1997 similarly protects people who violate certain state water laws.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSumming up: We&#39;re not judging whether the BP explosion was an &quot;act of God.&quot; That said, Perry&#39;s follow-up statement reflects the term&#39;s prevalence in law. We rate that statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-05T17:51:42.323115", "ruling_date": "2010-05-05T22:51:20", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
