Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, Democratic activist Paul Begala suggested the presumptive Republican presidential nominee took into account how he would personally fare under Ryan&rsquo;s wide-reaching proposal for overhauling federal taxes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBegala, a Texan advising a pro-Obama super-PAC, Priorities Action USA, said in a Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulbegala/status/234865312686829568\">post</a> on Aug. 12, 2012: &quot;So THAT&#39;S why he picked him. In Jan. debate Romney said of Ryan tax plan: &lsquo;Under that plan, I&rsquo;d have paid no taxes in the last two years.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDid Romney air the personal impact of Ryan&rsquo;s tax ideas so many months ago?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter emailing Begala, we found Romney&rsquo;s remark in the Republican presidential candidate debate held Jan. 23, 2012, in Tampa, Fla.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut according to the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/us-election-2012/republican-debate-transcript-tampa-florida-january-2012/p27180\">debate transcript</a>, Begala&rsquo;s tweet struck a misleading note: Romney, who earlier noted that his proposed tax plan calls for eliminating the tax on interest, dividends and capital gains for anyone making less than &nbsp;$200,000 a year, was referring to a plan advocated by then-candidate Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter Gingrich confirmed that his plan called for a 0 percent tax rate on capital gains, Romney said: &quot;Under that plan, I`d have paid no taxes in the last two years.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGingrich: &quot;Well, if that -- and if you created enough jobs doing that -- it was Alan Greenspan (former head of the Federal Reserve) who first said the best rate, if you want to create jobs for capital gains, is zero. My No. 1 &nbsp;goal is to create a maximum number of jobs to put the American people back to work. It`s a straightforward argument.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nModerator Brian Williams then changed the subject -- and Ryan&rsquo;s tax plan went unmentioned in the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begala later emailed us to share that his tweet stemmed from an Aug. 12, 2012, <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/paul-ryans-liberal-fan-club/\">news blog </a><a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/paul-ryans-liberal-fan-club/\">post </a>by the <em>New York Times</em>. The post, focused on Romney&rsquo;s just-revealed choice of Ryan, includes this: &quot;In addition, the budget Ryan presented to the House in April last year called for <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-would-paul-ryans-budget-give-mitt-romney-zero-taxes-20120812,0,464987.story\">the</a><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-would-paul-ryans-budget-give-mitt-romney-zero-taxes-20120812,0,464987.story\"> elimination of </a><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-would-paul-ryans-budget-give-mitt-romney-zero-taxes-20120812,0,464987.story\">taxes </a>on capital gains and dividend income. Romney pointed out in a January 2012 debate that &lsquo;Under that plan, I&rsquo;d have paid no taxes in the last two years.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBegala emailed us that his reliance on the <em>Times</em>&rsquo; account shows he &quot;was acting reasonably &amp; in good faith.&quot; The <em>Times</em>&rsquo; blog post &quot;may have been wrong, but I had a right to rely&quot; on it &quot;for a tweet.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wondering about the effect of Ryan&rsquo;s plan, we pulled up an Aug. 11, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/Ryan-Tax-Plan-Would-Slash-Romney-Tax-Rate-to-1-Percent-216837-1.html?pos=hbtxt\">news article</a> in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, stating that by its analysis, if Ryan&rsquo;s plan had been law, Romney&#39;s effective tax rate in 2010 would have been about 1 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story says Ryan&rsquo;s proposal would have shaved Romney&rsquo;s tax bill by about 90 percent by eliminating taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest -- an element identical to the Gingrich plank singled out by Romney in the debate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Since about 95 percent of Romney&#39;s $21.6 million income came from those sources in 2010,&quot; Roll Call said, &quot;he would pay no taxes on the vast majority of his earnings. It&#39;s not certain exactly how low Romney&#39;s tax bill would go, but his income from other sources amounts to about $1 million, and Ryan&#39;s plan would set a new top rate of 25 percent. Romney&#39;s total tax bill would have dropped from the $3 million that he paid to a few hundred thousand dollars if Ryan&#39;s plan had been in effect.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe story says Ryan also proposes eliminating the estate tax, &quot;which would benefit Romney&#39;s heirs by tens of millions of dollars.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe article&rsquo;s descriptions of Ryan&rsquo;s proposal align with <a href=\"http://roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=8514\">information</a> Ryan has on a website devoted to his proposal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeparately, Matthew O&rsquo;Brien of the Atlantic wrote in an Aug. 11, &nbsp;2012, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/mitt-romney-would-pay-082-percent-in-taxes-under-paul-ryans-plan/261027/\">blog post</a> that Romney&rsquo;s 2010 tax rate under the Ryan plan would have been .82 percent. While his capital gains would have gone untaxed, the post says, Romney&rsquo;s earnings of nearly $594,000 in author and speaking fees would be taxed at 25 percent. Romney would have saved another $292,389 under Ryan&rsquo;s proposed elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, according to the post, while still owing $29,151 in self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees. So he would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, the blog post says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe asked Romney&rsquo;s campaign about this claim. Spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that Romney has a tax plan, making speculation about other plans irrelevant. On his campaign <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/tax\">website</a>, Romney says he wants to maintain existing tax rates on capital gains, interest and dividends for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nContrary to Begala&rsquo;s claim, Romney was not zeroing in on how he would fare under Ryan&rsquo;s tax plan when he said he would have paid no taxes the past two years under &quot;that plan.&quot; He spoke instead to Gingrich&rsquo;s proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes for all taxpayers -- which Romney does not advocate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike Gingrich, though, Ryan calls for wiping out the capital gains tax for everyone, leaving this claim with an element of truth. We rate the statement Mostly False.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>UPDATE, 11:20 am, Aug. 14, 2012</strong></em>: <em>After we posted this article, we were happy to hear back about Begala&rsquo;s source for his claim.
