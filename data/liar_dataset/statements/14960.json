We found that the story offers no evidence to tie the former Haitian official, Klaus Eberwein, to criticisms of the Clinton Foundation and largely repeats information from a <a href=\"http://yournewswire.com/haiti-exposed-clinton-dead/\">fake news story last year</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July, the <em><a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article160983614.html\">Miami Herald</a> </em>reported that <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article4071120.html\">Eberwein</a>, a former Haitian government official, was found dead in a South Florida motel room. Eberwein, who had worked as an Uber driver in South Florida, had fallen on hard times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eberwein served as director general of the government&rsquo;s economic development agency, Fonds d&rsquo;assistance &eacute;conomique et social (FAES), from May 2012 until February 2015 when he was replaced. The Herald reported that Eberwein had faced allegations of fraud and corruption on how FAES administered funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eberwein shot himself in the head the day he was supposed to appear before the Haitian Senate&rsquo;s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission was investigating the management of PetroCaribe funds, the money Haiti receives from Venezuela&rsquo;s discounted oil program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Herald story made no mention of the Clinton Foundation or the Clintons. But a couple of days later, <a href=\"http://yournewswire.com/haiti-exposed-clinton-dead/\">YourNewsWire, </a>a website that posts fake news, made a series of inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements tying Eberwein to criticism of the Clinton Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your News Wire wrote that Eberwein was &quot;widely expected to testify that the <a href=\"http://yournewswire.com/clinton-foundation-admit-85-of-donations-do-not-go-to-charity/\">Clinton Foundation</a> misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,&quot; YourNewsWire quoted Eberwein as saying at a Clinton Foundation protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the website offered no evidence that Eberwein planned to testify against the Clinton Foundation or made any such statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Political News used many portions of the YourNewsWire article and then added some additional information, including a clip of actual statements by another former Haitian official about the Clintons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Political News&nbsp;included a <a href=\"http://theuspoliticalnews.com/haiti-official-getting-ready-to-testify-against-clinton-foundation-corruption-next-week-found-dead-with-gunshot-to-the-head/\">video</a> of the former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, at a 2016 Donald Trump campaign event in Little Haiti in South Florida. Sansaricq criticized the record of the Clintons in Haiti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article111179887.html\">Clintons</a> have a long and complicated history with Haiti, but there is no evidence that Eberwein was &quot;getting ready to ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption.&quot; He was getting ready to testify about something unrelated: money Haiti received from a Venezuela oil program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the timeline of the fake story makes no sense: Eberwein committed suicide in July 2017 while the January 2018 headline says he was getting ready to testify &quot;next week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this headline Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-25T15:59:43.111804", "ruling_date": "2018-01-26T15:53:01", "ruling_headline": "Fake story ties dead Haitian official to Clinton Foundation allegations", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-story-ties-dead-haitian-official-clinton-foun", "ruling_link_text": "Recycles other fake story", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>US Political News,<a href=\"http://theuspoliticalnews.com/haiti-official-getting-ready-to-testify-against-clinton-foundation-corruption-next-week-found-dead-with-gunshot-to-the-head/\"> &quot;Haiti official getting ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption next week, found dead with &lsquo;gunshot to the head,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Jan. 14, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YourNewsWire, <a href=\"http://yournewswire.com/haiti-exposed-clinton-dead/\">&quot;Haiti official, who exposed the Clinton Foundation, found dead In Miami,&quot;</a> July 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/klaus-eberwein/\">&quot;Did a Former Haitian Official Commit Suicide Before Clinton Testimony?&quot; </a>July 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article160983614.html\">&quot;Former Haiti government official shoots himself in the head in Miami-area hotel,&quot; </a>July 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article95259692.html\">&quot;This volatile Haiti slum is undergoing a makeover -- now what?&quot;</a> Aug. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article111179887.html\">&quot;In Miami, Haitian-American voters grapple with mixed feelings about Clinton,&quot; </a>Oct. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/dec/07/did-president-donald-trump-break-promise-floridas-/\">&quot;Did President Donald Trump break a promise to Florida&rsquo;s Haitian population?&quot; </a>Dec. 7, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4180, "last_name": "US Political News", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "us-political-news", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4180/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://theuspoliticalnews.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Haiti official getting ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption next week found dead with gunshot to the head.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2018-01-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
