Since 1967, it's clear that the top 5 percent of all households are capturing a growing share of the nation's aggregate income.\n</p>\n<p>\n From 1917 to 1998, the income share of the top 10 percent dropped and then began rising again, following a  U-shaped curve, according to a historical analysis of U.S. tax returns by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez published in 2003 in the\n <i>\n  Quarterly Journal of Economics\n </i>\n .\n</p>\n<p>\n Piketty and Saez found that economic inequality grew  further by 2005. That year, the top 1 percent of Americans &mdash; people with incomes of more than $348,000 &mdash; received their largest share of national income since 1928.\n</p>\n<p>\n Critics may argue whether this change in income distribution is significant or not, or what it's underlying causes are.
