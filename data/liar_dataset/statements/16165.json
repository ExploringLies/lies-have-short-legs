Chabot is locked in a tight race with Democratic challenger Aftab Pureval to claim the seat in Ohio&rsquo;s 1st Congressional District.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad says Chabot &quot;voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati&rsquo;s own Children&rsquo;s Hospital.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad&rsquo;s text, in full:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>&quot;While they shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry, some kids can&rsquo;t escape it. But Steve Chabot voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati&rsquo;s own Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The insurance industry that gave Chabot&rsquo;s campaign over $700,00 got their way. Just like they did when Chabot voted to rollback protections for pre-existing conditions. Steve Chabot listens to them, not us.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So did Chabot actually vote to deny health care to kids? And would it have impacted around half of the patients at Cincinnati&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is accurate Chabot voted for the GOP-backed American Health Care Act, though the bill didn&#39;t pass. If passed, the measure would have rolled back provisions from President Obama&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act, including protections for people living with pre-existing conditions and cuts to Medicaid, on which many poor children rely. About half of the patients at Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center are covered through Medicaid. But we don&#39;t know how many children specifically would have been affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The American Health Care Act and Steve Chabot</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, Steve Chabot voted to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House Majority PAC noted that Chabot&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll256.xml\" target=\"_blank\">vote</a> in question was related to the American Health Care Act, the GOP-backed plan to overhaul Obamacare. The measure narrowly passed the house with a 217-213 margin before it failed in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with leaving it up to states how much of the ACA should be overturned, the AHCA would have reduced <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$880 billion</a> in Medicaid spending over a 10-year period, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare, but also would have rolled back state-by-state expansions of Medicaid, which covers millions of low-income children.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Potential impacts on children enrolled in Medicaid</div>\r\n\r\n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/child-and-chip-enrollment/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">35 million</a> children are enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, constituting the largest group in the program, although they represent a smaller share of expenditures compared to other groups. <a href=\"http://files.kff.org/attachment/fact-sheet-medicaid-state-OH\" target=\"_blank\">In Ohio, </a>Medicaid covers two in every five children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AHCA would have altered Medicaid&rsquo;s financing, ending the current federal-state partnership and converting the program to a per-capita or block grant starting in 2020. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the House vote on the bill in May 2017, <a href=\"http://go.avalere.com/acton/attachment/12909/f-0483/1/-/-/-/-/Avalere%20-%20Childrens%20Hospital%20Association%20Report%20on%20Medicaid%20Capped%20Funding%20embargo.pdf?utm_source=Avalere%20Report&amp;utm_medium=Press%20Release&amp;utm_campaign=Avalere%20Report&amp;nc=1\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> released by Avalere Health, a Washington D.C.-based healthcare consulting firm, estimated how much child health could be threatened if Medicaid faced the changes laid out in the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization found that, nationally, children&rsquo;s Medicaid would get hit with reduced funding of $43 billion over 10 years under a per-capita cap model, with reductions in spending becoming more dramatic each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Affordable Care Act also raised Medicaid&rsquo;s minimum income eligibility limit for children from 100 to 138 percent of the poverty line.
