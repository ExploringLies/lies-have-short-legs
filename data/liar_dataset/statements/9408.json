Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., continue to give our readers pause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve twice debunked wild posts claiming Bachmann said Jesus wrote the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/feb/12/facebook-posts/bachmann-didnt-say-bible-was-written-english-and-n/\"><u>Bible in English</u></a> and that she said President Barack Obama might be <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/10/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-michele-bachmann-said-we-have-z/\"><u>responsible for the April Fort Hood, Texas, shooting spree</u></a>. Both quotes were made up, so they got our Pants on Fire rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, a reader asked us to investigate a third post, a screenshot of Bachmann in mid speech with a quote overlay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The nation has gotten away from the principles of the founding fathers under the failed leadership of Barack Obama. This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again,&quot; the posts quotes Bachmann as saying on Fox News on May 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this were a baseball game, we&rsquo;d call &quot;strike three!&quot; Yes, Bachmann is no fan of Obama. Yes, she is known to bring up the founding fathers, sometimes to <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/05/michele-bachmann-in-overdrive-her-10-greatest-hits/\"><u>controversial ends</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no, she did not remember iconic American Ben Franklin as a past president.&nbsp;Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, served as the nation&rsquo;s first postmaster general and later as U.S. ambassador to France. But he was never president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A search of transcripts and news stories for the quote came up dry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachmann spokesman Dat Kotman said she did not even appear on Fox that day, and we could not find any evidence that she did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if the meme weren&#39;t&nbsp;fishy enough, the screenshot is also the backdrop for the fake quote about Fort Hood. It&rsquo;s originally from <a href=\"http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2013/06/michele_bachmann_on_fox_news_i_may_run_for_another_public_office_video.php\"><u>Bachmann&rsquo;s June 2013 interview</u></a> on Fox News&rsquo; <em>Hannity </em>when she discussed her decision to leave Congress at the end of her term in January 2015. The post appears to track back to a satirical group called &quot;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/C4MB12.0\">Christians for Michele Bachmann</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachmann did extol Franklin in a high-profile address, but she did not refer to him as a president. She referenced Franklin twice in a speech announcing that she was <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=98811\"><u>abandoning her 2012 presidential bid.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachmann alluded to a painting by Howard Chandler Christy of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, which hangs in a stairway in the Capitol&rsquo;s House wing. She remembers seeing the painting, with its reminder of the &quot;connection we have to the principles of freedom and justice,&quot; on the night she decided to seek the Oval Office. Benjamin Franklin is seated distinctly in the center of the painting, one of the most visible figures in a sea of powdered wigs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But never was the painting&#39;s reminder more poignant than on the evening of March 21, 2010, the day Obamacare was passed,&quot; Bachmann said. &quot;Staring out from the painting is the face of Ben Franklin as a consistent reminder of the fragile Republic he and the founders gave to us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She did not refer to him as a past president then, and we could not find other examples of her mistaking him for a president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A meme claims that Bachmann said, &quot;This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again.&quot; This&nbsp;quote is made up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachmann wasn&#39;t on TV the night of her alleged remarks and we could find no reference of her claiming Franklin was president.
