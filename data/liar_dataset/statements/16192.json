Claire McCaskill, an audience member asked about businesses and jobs moving out of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hawley, who is vying for McCaskill&rsquo;s Senate seat, sought to explain how that issue was personal to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The rural town that I grew up in &mdash; Lexington, Missouri, it&#39;s not too far from here &mdash; we used to have a manufacturing operation in that town, made the gunstock for Remington rifles, I believe it was,&quot; he said. &quot;And that plant closed down, we lost those jobs and it&#39;s been devastating for my little town.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know more about Hawley&rsquo;s story. Was it true that a gunstock manufacturing operation closed, taking away jobs?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">A brief history</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gunstock manufacturer S&amp;K Industries, a gunstock manufacturing company founded by Roy Stout in 1961.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1986, S&amp;K picked up Remington Arms as a client. The family business had three locations in Lexington, said Penny Grosso, executive director of the Lexington Chamber of Cmmerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remington went on to buy two of them, said city administrator Joe Aull. (We confirmed one facility&rsquo;s purchase happened in September 2009, according to a 2010 air pollution permit with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered how the sale might have led to a facility closure or lost jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding the answer was more complicated than we thought. Multiple calls to Remington Arms Company&rsquo;s national press office were not returned. Former S&amp;K president Thomas Stout could not be reached. The Hawley campaign did not respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After checking past records and speaking with a longtime plant worker, Aull said S&amp;K never shut down its facilities before the sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third site, at 8th and Main streets, was not part of the Remington sale. We found another 2010 air pollution permit for S&amp;K to operate a &quot;new wood trophy parts and plaque painting process&quot; on that location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That permit noted S&amp;K previously housed a gunstock manufacturing facility there. But, &quot;the operation was shut down in December 2008&quot; and the original permit eventually expired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be noted that from 2008 to the sale, S&amp;K was still selling gunstocks, per many posts on an online forum for gun owners, suggesting the other locations were still in operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a postscript: Lexington&rsquo;s Remington Arms almost closed down, but in 2017 received a $1.6 million state grant for upgrades to its plant in return for promising that the company would employ at least 80 people and stay in town for another five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hawley said that the gunstock manufacturing plant in his hometown of Lexington &quot;closed down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the three S&amp;K Industries locations in Lexington, one site shut down for gunstock manufacturing, but the rest continued operations and were purchased by Remington Arms without much hassle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So technically, Hawley is right, but it was just one facility, not an entire business. His statement overstates the effect, making it seem like the manufacturing business left town or was shuttered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-05T12:52:45.650153", "ruling_date": "2018-11-05T13:39:49", "ruling_headline": "Checking Josh Hawley on whether a gunstock company in his hometown closed down", "ruling_headline_slug": "checking-josh-hawley-whether-gunstock-company-his-", "ruling_link_text": "One facility, not the whole company", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Press release from Missouri Department of Economic Development, &quot;<a href=\"https://ded.mo.gov/content/state-helps-lexington-company-upgrade-facility-positioning-it-compete-and-retain-strong\">State helps Lexington company upgrade facility, positioning it to compete and retain strong employment</a>,&quot;
