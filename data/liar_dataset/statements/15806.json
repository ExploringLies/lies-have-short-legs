(He was sworn in as mayor November 2014.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRA did not sue.

Hammer, former NRA president <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2017/01/09/hammer-mayor-gillums-attack-nra-unwise/96349696/\">wrote</a> in an opinion piece published by the Tallahassee Democrat in January 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second Amendment Foundation and Florida Carry <a href=\"https://www.saf.org/florida-carry-inc-and-second-amendment-foundation-v-city-of-tallahassee-et-al/\">said</a><a href=\"https://www.floridacarry.org/litigation/21-flcourts/103-florida-carry-saf-v-city-of-tallahassee\"> they were suing</a> Tallahassee and its elected officials for &quot;refusing to repeal ordinances restricting the use of firearms in defiance of Florida&rsquo;s firearms preemption law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lawsuit claimed that the ordinances (one from 1957 and another from 1984, amended in 1988) had been reprinted without being amended, and infringed on the Florida Legislature&rsquo;s intent to provide uniform firearm laws across the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 1987 <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0790/Sections/0790.33.html\">Florida law</a> gave the state the exclusive power to regulate firearms and ammunition, and deemed &quot;null and void&quot; related local ordinances and regulations. The legislature in 2011 doubled down on the law by allowing penalties against local officials who enacted or enforced firearm regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1957 provision said, &quot;No person shall discharge any firearms except in areas five acres or larger zoned for agricultural uses.&quot; The ordinance amended in 1988 made it &quot;unlawful for any person to discharge a firearm in a park or recreational facility owned, managed, maintained, or controlled by the city,&quot; <a href=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/fl_carry_v._cot_appellate_ruling.pdf\">the lawsuit said</a>. It added that Gillum and other commissioners in February 2014 voted in favor of indefinitely tabling a repeal discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city of Tallahassee, in a <a href=\"https://www.floridacarry.org/images/stories/Tallahassee/Florida_Carry_v._Tally_MTD.pdf\">filing</a> to dismiss the lawsuit, argued that Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation had &quot;no clear legal right to compel&quot; city commissioners to repeal the ordinances and that since the legislature had rendered the ordinances invalid, &quot;nothing else is required.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, the case moved forward. A circuit court judge, George S. Reynolds, III, ultimately sided with the city, saying that the city&rsquo;s actions did not enact or cause the ordinances to be enforced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While cleaning up the city code so that old city ordinances which are no longer legal, relevant, or enforced are removed may be good public policy, it remains the city&rsquo;s prerogative &ndash; not the plaintiffs, nor this court&rsquo;s,&quot; <a href=\"https://judicial.clerk.leon.fl.us/image_orders.asp?caseid=2624595&amp;jiscaseid=&amp;defseq=&amp;chargeseq=&amp;dktid=103975515&amp;dktsource=CRTV\">Reynolds</a><a href=\"https://cvweb.clerk.leon.fl.us/public/clerk_services/online_searches/high_profile/index.asp\"> wrote</a> in his November 2015 opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The groups <a href=\"https://judicial.clerk.leon.fl.us/image_orders.asp?caseid=2624595&amp;jiscaseid=&amp;defseq=&amp;chargeseq=&amp;dktid=104076891&amp;dktsource=CRTV\">appealed</a> to the Florida 1st District Court of Appeal. But the appeals court in February 2017 also ruled in favor of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the ordinances &quot;may still be &lsquo;on the books,&rsquo; they are unenforceable and invalid,&quot; the <a href=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/fl_carry_v._cot_appellate_ruling.pdf\">court&rsquo;s</a><a href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/fl_carry_v._cot_appellate_ruling.pdf\"> opinion</a> said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum said that he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby &quot;all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn&rsquo;t shoot guns in city parks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum was among Tallahassee elected officials sued by two gun rights groups for not repealing a decades-old ordinance restricting the use of firearms in city parks. The local ordinance had been deemed null and void by a state law and not been enforced. The NRA supported the groups and filed an amicus brief, but it was not a formal party in the litigation. Other gun rights groups were the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum&rsquo;s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
