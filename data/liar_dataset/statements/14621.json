The same story <a href=\"http://californianews.co/2017/10/09/breaking-president-trump-signs-executive-order-stripping-nfl-non-profit-status/\">appeared on</a> <a href=\"http://anews-24.com/2017/10/09/president-trump-signs-executive-order-stripping-nfl-of-non-profit-status/\">several other</a> <a href=\"http://observeronline.news/president-trump-signs-executive-order-stripping-nfl-of-non-profit-status/\">websites reported by</a> <a href=\"http://defensepatriot.club/2017/10/09/breaking-president-trump-signs-executive-order-stripping-nfl-non-profit-status/\">Facebook users</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story, which is fake, said Trump on Oct. 8 had revoked the NFL&rsquo;s &quot;401(c)(3) status &lsquo;until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.&rsquo; &quot; (There is no such thing as tax-exempt 401(c)(3) classification in the tax code.) This was a response to players protesting racial inequity by kneeling during the <em>Star-Spangled Banner</em>, which has raised Trump&rsquo;s hackles in recent weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it may surprise some to know that the NFL&rsquo;s league office did have tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit &mdash; a <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/types-of-organizations-exempt-under-section-501c6\">tax classification</a> for business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate and trade boards and yes, <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/professional-football-leagues\">professional football leagues</a>. The change in the tax code was <a href=\"http://time.com/3839164/nfl-tax-exempt-status/\">granted in 1966</a>, to allow the NFL and AFL to merge without the threat of violating anti-trust laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The league office essentially acts as a trade organization for the individual teams, which are what make most of the league&rsquo;s profits, which are taxed. This is different than 501(c)(3) status, which is for charitable organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the league <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/national-football-league-surrenders-tax-exempt-status/\">voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status in 2015</a> after being criticized by politicians who thought the entire league was avoiding taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you know, the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years,&quot; NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in the letter to team owners that year. &quot;The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax-exempt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., revived the subject on Sept. 26 when he <a href=\"https://gaetz.house.gov/media/press-releases/gaetz-tells-nfl-tax-breaks-take-knee\">became lead sponsor of the Pro Sports Act</a>, looking to make the voluntary status change permanent by <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/296\">changing the tax code</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also brought up the issue on Oct. 10, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/917694644481413120\">when he tweeted</a>, &quot;Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country?
