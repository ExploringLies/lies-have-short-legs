Paul Ryan, R-Wis., recently took to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@PRyan/expanding-opportunity-kempforum16-11fe61f733d2#.y593ohi7t\">Medium</a> to set the stage for a forum in Columbia, S.C., on Republican efforts to fight poverty. The forum, hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.wyff4.com/news/several-gop-candidates-in-sc-for-kemp-foundation-forum/37349032\">drew six 2016 Republican presidential candidates</a> &ndash;&nbsp;former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, retired physician Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his Medium column, Ryan wrote that a new direction was needed on government anti-poverty efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And I don&rsquo;t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you&rsquo;re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago. I&rsquo;m not saying we haven&rsquo;t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty\u200a&ndash;&nbsp;that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll check Ryan&rsquo;s statement that &quot;today, if you were raised poor, you&rsquo;re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Ryan&rsquo;s staff for their evidence, they pointed us to an academic paper by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, Emmanuel Saez&nbsp;and Nicholas Turner, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/images/mobility_trends.pdf\">Is the United States Still a Land of Opportunity? Recent Trends in Intergenerational Mobility</a>&quot; from January 2014. Chetty and Hendren are at Harvard, Kline and Saez are at the University of California-Berkeley, and Turner was with the U.S. Treasury Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper, based on extensive analysis of income and educational-attainment data, found that &quot;intergenerational mobility&quot; has &quot;remained extremely stable&quot; since the generation of Americans born in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s,&quot; the authors wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked one of the co-authors, Saez, whether Ryan&rsquo;s summary left out anything important, he said no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, this is broadly correct,&quot; Saez told PolitiFact. Saez said the paper shows the odds of staying in the bottom one-fifth of the income distribution when your parents were in the bottom one-fifth have stayed stable for the past four to five decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper and Saez in the interview both noted one caveat &ndash; that the consequences of the pattern Ryan is citing have worse effects today because inequality has grown over the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Because inequality has risen,&quot; the paper notes, &quot;the consequences of the &lsquo;birth lottery&rsquo; &ndash; the parents to whom a child is born &ndash; are larger today than in the past.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this caveat doesn&rsquo;t undermine Ryan&rsquo;s point. If anything, it accentuates it. (We&#39;re also not penalizing Ryan for rounding up the study&#39;s length to 50 years.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed, said the paper Ryan chose is a credible one within the profession. &quot;These are the authors I would turn to&quot; when looking at intergenerational mobility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan wrote that &quot;today, if you were raised poor, you&rsquo;re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.&quot; His support for this claim&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a respected academic paper published in 2014 &ndash;&nbsp;found exactly what Ryan described.
