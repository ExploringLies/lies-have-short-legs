(Mohamed bin Salman is now crown prince and sits at the center of the speculation over the circumstances of Khashoggi&rsquo;s death.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Trump and King Salman participated in the signing ceremony for almost $110 billion worth of defense capabilities,&quot; the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-king-salman-sign-arms-deal/\">White House announced</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The press release said the arms package expanded opportunities for American companies in the region, &quot;potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Tens of thousands is a far cry from hundreds of thousands of jobs, but we&rsquo;ll get back to that in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $110 billion itself is in doubt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The $110 billion is not even remotely solid,&quot; said U.S. Naval War College professor Jonathan Caverley. &quot;The State Department only counts <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/279540.htm\">$14.5 billion in implemented&rsquo; sales</a> from this deal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even that sum is suspect, Caverley added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution in Washington said that deal is on shaky ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Saudis let pass a September deadline for the deal with Lockheed Martin,&quot; Riedel <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/10/after-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-to-the-saudis-are-essential-leverage/\">recently wrote</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Defense Security Cooperation Agency oversees foreign military sales. Not counting the THAAD contract, its <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/tags/saudi-arabia\">summary of sales to Saudi Arabia</a> under Trump totals a little over $2 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense analyst Rachel Stohl at the Stimson Center, a private defense policy think tank, noted that the $110 billion rolled in some old offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Many of those were deals negotiated under the Obama administration, and only a small fraction have been filled,&quot; Stohl said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the typical pattern for these announcements: Fanfare comes first, followed by a more modest reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Obama offered Saudi Arabia something like $115 billion in arms while in office, and just about half of that resulted in sales,&quot; Jennifer Spindel, an international security professor at the University of Oklahoma, told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even sale agreements take a long time to play out. In <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/fiscal_year_series_-_30_september_2017.pdf#page=354\">the past 10 years</a>, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had $85.5 billion in sales agreements, but only $24.5 billion in actual deliveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That time lag has major implications for jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">A long runway for jobs</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we get into the dicey link between contracts and jobs in America, it&rsquo;s important to note that some of the deals involve building things in Saudi Arabia, not the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://mci.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/News/Pages/19-05-17-02.aspx\">Ministry of Commerce and Development</a> touted partnerships in 2016 to build Black Hawk helicopters and space video surveillance satellites in the kingdom. So sales contracts don&rsquo;t necessarily lead to manufacturing jobs in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that caveat, let&rsquo;s look at the one year where we have estimates that tie jobs at home to <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/middle-east/north-africa/saudi-arabia\">all exports to Saudi Arabia</a>, whether that&rsquo;s planes, corn or software consultants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, the U.S. Commerce Department said exports &quot;supported an estimated 165,000 jobs.&quot; That included both direct jobs and the knock-on effect of the money from those sales working through the economy. The same year, <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/international-trade-goods-and-services\">exports totalled $29.7 billion</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Divide the jobs by the dollars and you find that for every dollar in exports, the United States gets .0000056 of a job. Which might not like sound like much, but obviously it does when you start talking about billions in sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if the $110 billion in arms sales were locked down and came in one single year, the math says they would generate more than 600,000 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why that isn&rsquo;t in the cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know the $110 billion is at best aspirational, but the other big issue is that military contracts play out over many years. The arms experts we reached said smaller ones of about $200 to $300 million typically take three to four years for completion. The bigger systems take much longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A decade is the ballpark in terms of minimum time between initial signing of a deal and the delivery of the capability, with money disbursed across the life of the contract,&quot; Caverley at the War College said. &quot;It will probably take even longer given the new Saudi requirements that 50 percent of the work needs to be performed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will have to develop a massive amount of defense industrial capability that currently does not exist in order to handle this work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if Saudi Arabia bought everything it said it wanted, the yearly jobs impact would be more in the range of 60,000 to 120,000. That&rsquo;s not close to the hundreds of thousands Trump has talked about.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The $450 billion mystery</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that all told, Saudi Arabia has $450 billion in orders from the United States. We asked the White House and the U.S. - Saudi Arabian Business Council for any data on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/international-trade-goods-and-services\">exports of goods and services</a> in 2017 were $25.4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hossein Askari, a business professor at George Washington&nbsp;University, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump&rsquo;s assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion,&quot; Askari said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that Saudi Arabia has ordered $450 billion from U.S. companies, including $110 billion in military contracts, representing over a million jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orders on that scale don&rsquo;t exist. There is no data behind the $450 billion, and the $110 billion is a blend of smaller deals in progress, old offers that have not come through, and speculative discussions that have yet to move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s claims about jobs ignores the long runway between signed agreements and actual delivery and payment. He treats spending that could play out over a decade as if it were spent in one year. More importantly, if the $450 billion in orders is a mirage, the 1 million jobs is equally without substance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-23T13:44:15.303716", "ruling_date": "2018-10-23T15:40:58", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump touts nonexistent $450 billion in Saudi orders and 1 million jobs ", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-touts-nonexistent-450-billion-saudi-o", "ruling_link_text": "Baseless totals", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-gaggle-air-force-one-departure-october-20-2018\">Exchange with reporters</a>, Oct. 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-king-salman-sign-arms-deal/\">President Trump and King Salman Sign Arms Deal</a>, May 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5170.html\">Trade in Goods with Saudi Arabia</a>, August 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/international-trade-goods-and-services\">International Trade in Goods and Services</a>, Oct. 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/middle-east/north-africa/saudi-arabia\">U.S.-Saudi Arabia Trade Facts</a>, accessed Oct. 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. - Saudi Arabian Business Council, <a href=\"https://us-sabc.org/u-s-saudi-arabian-trade-update-february-2018/\">U.S.-Saudi Arabian Trade Update &ndash; February 2018</a>, March 1. 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Security Cooperation Agency, <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/tags/saudi-arabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, March 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Security Cooperation Agency, <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/news-media/news-archive/us-has-already-sold-more-weapons-year-all-2017-47b\">U.S. Has Already Sold More Weapons This Year Than All 2017: $47B</a>, July 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Security Cooperation Agency, <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/news-media/news-archive/remarks-lieutenant-general-charles-hooper\">Remarks by Lieutenant General Charles Hooper</a>, Sept. 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Security Cooperation Agency, <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/fiscal_year_series_-_30_september_2017.pdf\">Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military Construction Sales And Other Security Cooperation Historical Facts</a>, Sept. 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Security Cooperation Agency, <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/news-media/news-archive/fact-sheet-intended-sales-saudi-arabia-foreign-military-sales\">Fact Sheet: Intended Sales to Saudi Arabia via Foreign Military Sales</a>, May 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. State Department, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/279540.htm\">U.S. Security Cooperation With Saudi Arabia</a>, Oct. 16, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brookings Institution, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/10/after-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-to-the-saudis-are-essential-leverage/\">After Khashoggi, US arms sales to the Saudis are essential leverage</a>, Oct. 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia Ministry of Commerce and Development, <a href=\"https://mci.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/News/Pages/19-05-17-02.aspx\">Trade Volume Between Saudi Arabia And The United States Of America Reached SR 142 Billion In 2016</a>, May 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brookings Institution, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/\">The $110 billion arms deal to Saudi Arabia is fake news</a>, June 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/trumps-claim-jobs-saudi-deals-grows-by-leaps-bounds/?utm_term=.90103cfed76b\">Trump&rsquo;s claim of jobs from Saudi deals grows by leaps and bounds</a>, Oct. 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Jonathan D.
