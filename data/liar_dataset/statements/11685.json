Democrats said the focus, given the bad news from Oscar Mayer and several other major employers, should be on the economy and jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are on pace to double layoffs since 2014,&quot; declared Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Shankland (D-Stevens Point.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is the governor&#39;s worst year of his administration in terms of layoffs,&quot; she continued. &quot;We&#39;re well over 10,000 layoffs and the people of Wisconsin are crying out for action.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Shankland&rsquo;s office for backup, an aide said Shankland was using state Department of Workforce Development <a href=\"http://worknet.wisconsin.gov/worknet/downloads.aspx?menuselection=da&amp;pgm=pcml\">data on notices of plant closings and mass layoffs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shankland aide Annika Petty noted the &quot;list does not yet include the layoffs announced in early November by Oscar Mayer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unpacking the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 2014, the state received layoff warning notices that covered 7,239 jobs. As of Nov. 2, 2015, the tally for this year was 11,057.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you add in the Oscar Mayer layoff,that would bring it to about 12,050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not quite double, but two months of data remained at the time Shankland made her claim and the numbers from earlier months suggest her claim is generally on target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the layoff number are nowhere near as solid as Shankland suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is how the system works:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin&rsquo;s law is more strict than federal law, which sets the threshold at more than 100 workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don&rsquo;t reach the 50 person threshold. And the notices don&rsquo;t always mean lost jobs. When a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, layoffs take place immediately. In other cases -- such as with Oscar Mayer -- the plant closing is expected months later. In still others, they never take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the numbers don&rsquo;t represent actual layoffs. As such, experts say they are a lousy tool for assessing the state&rsquo;s economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what we found when we rated a July 2015 claim from the liberal group American Bridge 21st Century, which said Wisconsin&rsquo;s economy had &quot;tanked&quot; under Walker and &quot;so far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/10/american-bridge-21st-century/american-bridge-21st-century-says-layoffs-show-eco/\">False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shankland&rsquo;s claim is somewhat different, in that she does not directly cite the number as evidence of the state&rsquo;s economy tanking. But she did make it at a news conference that asserted more action is needed on jobs due to poor economic performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts such as Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College, say a far better indicator of the employment picture -- but one that&rsquo;s not without it&rsquo;s own flaws -- is the monthly jobs report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers show that as of October 2015, the state added an estimated 30,300 jobs in 2015. That includes a preliminary estimate of 15,100 private sector jobs added in October alone. The number is preliminary and subject to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the important point is this: Those figures are the net result of all changes, including layoffs and jobs added, not just one side of the coin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shankland said Wisconsin &quot;is on pace to double the number of layoffs this year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She cited layoff notices received by the state. But those aren&rsquo;t actual layoffs. And while she&rsquo;s about right on the number of notices received, she&rsquo;s wrong to suggest that the employment numbers are headed downward this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the time frame she cited the state&rsquo;s added about 30,300 jobs. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-12-15T20:57:59.306962", "ruling_date": "2015-12-21T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Numbers cited by Katrina Shankland on layoffs don't tell the story", "ruling_headline_slug": "numbers-cited-katrina-shankland-layoffs-dont-tell-", "ruling_link_text": "Data cited obscures the full picture", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rep.
