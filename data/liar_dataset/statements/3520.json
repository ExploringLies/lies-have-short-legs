Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, said nursing homes would shutter without the extra cash.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Ninety percent of Texans say that they do not want the nursing homes to close,&quot; Turner said on the House floor March 31. &quot;It polls higher than anything else.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurner, who introduced an amendment to draw an extra $1 billion from the state&rsquo;s savings to close the budget gap, hammered the point later: &quot;Not 9 percent, not 20 percent, but 90 percent of Texans. And I know not all 90 percent of Texans are Democrats.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered whether nursing homes really polled higher than any other service facing funding cuts as the state grapples with the budget crisis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBacking up: Advocates have warned that 33 percent in cuts proposed for nursing homes that accept residents who are covered by Medicaid will force homes to close, according to a March 23 Austin American-Statesman article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllison Lowery, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, told us that of the 90,000 residents of nursing homes statewide, 56,000 &nbsp;&mdash; about 60 percent &mdash; are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlison Brock, Turner&rsquo;s chief of staff, passed on a Feb. 22 press release from the Texas Health Care Association, that said &quot;a new University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll finding 90 percent of Texans expressing opposition to cutting state-funded nursing home care exemplifies the depth of public opposition to proposed&quot; cuts. &quot;The 90 percent opposition to nursing home cuts represents the highest level of opposition to all of the funding cut categories tested.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we looked at the relevant question in the Feb. 21 poll: &quot;The Texas Legislature is currently discussing different ways to reduce state spending in order to address the state&rsquo;s budget shortfall. Please think about the following list of proposals for cutting the budget, and check all of the measures you think should be taken to reduce spending.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe least popular budget proposal &mdash; cutting &quot;state funding for nursing home care&quot; &mdash; was checked by only 10 percent of respondents. And so it follows that 90 percent opted to not cut nursing home funding. The most popular proposal &mdash; ending &quot;funding for pre-kindergarten classes&quot; &mdash; was checked by 38 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a Texas Tribune news article accompanying the poll results, &quot;voters were protective of state programs, and overwhelmingly so.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJim Henson, one of the pollsters who teamed up with the Tribune, confirmed the online poll&rsquo;s results, which have a margin of error of 3.46. The sample size: 800 registered Texas voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we looked for other polls.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA September UT/Texas Tribune poll found that more than half of respondents said they would support increased funding for border security, but oppose higher funding for community colleges (73 percent), pre-kindergarten programs (72 percent), nursing homes (68 percent) and increased exemptions from the business franchise tax (78 percent). The poll doesn&rsquo;t ask respondents whether they&rsquo;d want to cut spending for nursing homes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA January poll commissioned by the Austin American-Statesman and other newspapers found that voters want to spare public education and health care programs from budget cuts, with about 70 percent of respondents saying lawmakers shouldn&#39;t cut school spending, while 61 percent said they want no cuts on health care programs for children and low- to moderate-income families. Respondents weren&rsquo;t asked about nursing homes.<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHenson told us this poll and the UT/Tribune&rsquo;s poll are the only statewide surveys that he&rsquo;s aware of that cover budget cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur results: The UT/Tribune poll found that 90 percent of respondents didn&rsquo;t want state funding for nursing home care cut, and opposition to that idea polled &quot;higher than anything else,&quot; as Turner said. Though he erred when he couched that as opposition to closing nursing homes &mdash; the poll didn&rsquo;t ask about that &mdash; it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that a comparable percentage of respondents would feel negatively about closures as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut gauging the strength of statewide public opinion on the basis of a single, online poll of 800 voters is a questionable proposition. We rate Turner&rsquo;s statement as Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-01T17:37:31.360058", "ruling_date": "2011-04-02T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Rep.
