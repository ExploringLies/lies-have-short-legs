On Rhode Island ballots, it is the option called Straight Party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKenneth Block, founder and chairman of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, has launched a campaign to get rid of the master lever, saying it&rsquo;s outdated and creates confusion for many voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a recent appearance on the &quot;State of the State&quot; television program, Block said that in the November 2012 election, &quot;More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn&#39;t have a single Moderate on their ballot.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlock, a businessman, gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot in 2010 as the Moderate Party&rsquo;s candidate for governor. He came in last in a four-way race, with 6.5 percent of the votes. But that was enough to win a spot on the 2012 and 2014 ballots for his party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to know how Block calculated that 9,000 figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy e-mail, Block said that he started with 9,424 -- the number of people he said voted by the master lever for the Moderate Party. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen he did some estimating, based in part on the size of the communities and districts with a Moderate candidate on the ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe noted that the Moderate Party had a candidate in just three communities -- Burrillville, East Greenwich and South Kingstown -- and two legislative districts -- House District 65, in East Providence, and Senate District 16, which is all of Central Falls and a piece of Pawtucket.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlock then estimated the number of voters he thought would have cast a straight-party Moderate vote in those communities and districts. He subtracted that estimated total from the total of all Rhode Island voters who selected the Moderate Party with one ballot mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe didn&rsquo;t provide an exact final number -- just &quot;more than 9,000.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we checked Block&rsquo;s number, we discovered he was close, but not directly on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo begin with, both the secretary of state&rsquo;s office and the Board of Elections said the number of Moderate Party straight-party votes was actually 9,295 -- not the 9,424 Block started with.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen we obtained exact numbers of master-lever votes for the Moderate Party in the communities and districts with Moderates on the ballot .<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiguel J. Nunez, planning specialist at the Board of Elections, told us there were 208 such votes in Burrillville, where a Moderate candidate was running for School Committee. But that race was non-partisan and the candidates &nbsp;weren&rsquo;t identified by party so, technically, it doesn&rsquo;t fit Block&rsquo;s definition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the other communities and legislative districts with identified Moderate candidates on the ballot, there were a total of 642 master-lever votes cast for the party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSubtract that number from the 9,295 statewide votes and you get 8,653 -- close to 350 fewer than Block&rsquo;s &quot;more than 9,000.&quot; Even if you add the 208 votes from Burrillville, you still don&rsquo;t get to 9,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKenneth Block said, &quot;More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn&#39;t have a single moderate on their ballot.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe derived that number in part from guesswork. But according to the precise figures from the Board of Elections, he was off by nearly 350 -- roughly 4 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Block&rsquo;s underlying point that the master lever confuses many voters is valid. More than 8,000 used it to vote for Moderate Party candidates when there weren&rsquo;t any on their ballots.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor those reasons, we rule his claim<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"> Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
