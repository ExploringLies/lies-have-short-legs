And I want them to use American steel, American product. I want it manufactured here. And I made those changes just before we signed it. I said, Where&#39;s the steel coming from? So, all pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel, which is really a big factor.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, while mentioning the Keystone, which still needs approvals before it can be built, Trump is claiming &quot;all pipelines that are coming into&quot; the United States have to be made with American steel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Keystone XL&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proposed by energy giant TransCanada, the 1,179-mile Keystone XL would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Western Canada to Nebraska. Then it would connect with an existing pipeline system to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/apr/16/kirsten-gillibrand/will-oil-keystone-xl-pipeline-stay-us/\">refineries on the Gulf Coast</a>, where the oil would be turned into petroleum products such as gasoline. The refineries export about two-thirds of their products; the rest is sold in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project had been in limbo for more than seven years when the company&rsquo;s application to build the pipeline was <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/usandworld/obama-administration-kills-keystone-xl-pipeline-b99611287z1-341804231.html\">rejected</a> in November 2015 by President <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/\">Barack Obama</a>. He said the pipeline wouldn&#39;t serve U.S. national interests and would undercut America&#39;s global leadership on climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would build the Keystone and get &quot;a piece of the profits&quot; -- a pledge that&rsquo;s been rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1358/approve-keystone-xl-project-and-reap-profits/\">In the Works</a> on PolitiFact&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/\">Trump-O-Meter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important step was taken in March 2017 when, at Trump&rsquo;s urging, the State Department <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1358/approve-keystone-xl-project-and-reap-profits/\">issued a presidential permit</a> for the Keystone. The permit is necessary for the pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canadian border. But before the pipeline can be built, it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/business/energy-environment/keystone-oil-pipeline.html?_r=0\">must win approval</a> from the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The steel connection, meanwhile, relates to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-construction-american-pipelines\">a memorandum</a> regarding construction of American pipelines that Trump signed in January 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keystone and steel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memorandum calls for U.S oil pipelines <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1358/approve-keystone-xl-project-and-reap-profits/\">to use American steel</a> in their construction -- but it is not an order carrying strict requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memo directs the secretary of commerce to &quot;develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States,&quot; use materials and equipment produced in the United States, &quot;to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five weeks after Trump signed the memorandum, the White House stated explicitly that it does not apply to the Keystone XL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1404/use-us-steel-infrastructure-projects/\">told reporters</a> that because the Keystone is not a &quot;new&quot; project, it is not bound by the memo. &quot;But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that (memorandum),&quot; <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/03/press-gaggle-principal-deputy-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-en-route\">she said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The White House didn&#39;t provide us any information to back up Trump&#39;s claim.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While carrying the weight of the president&rsquo;s signature, the memorandum has the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/24/executive-order-vs-presidential-memorandum-whats-difference/96979014/\">force of law</a> only over the executive branch of the federal government. (And for that matter, it is arguably a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/24/executive-order-vs-presidential-memorandum-whats-difference/96979014/\">lesser</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/31/claims-regarding-obamas-use-of-executive-orders-and-presidential-memoranda/?utm_term=.f623db8a945c\">form</a> of presidential action than an executive order.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, as Reuters has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pipelines-kemp-idUSKBN1591DQ\">reported</a>, the memorandum contains &quot;legal language about ordering things to the maximum extent permitted by law, which is designed to preserve lots of wiggle-room&quot;; and the attempt to mandate the use of American steel &quot;would almost certainly violate 70 years of settled international trade law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris Weld, a Washington trade lawyer whose firm represents American steel companies, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/26/donald-trumps-pledge-to-use-only-u-s-steel-is-loaded-with-caveats/?utm_term=.d55cdd4717b6\">told</a> the Washington Post that the memorandum is not a mandate, but rather &nbsp;&quot;a message to U.S. pipeline operators to consider steps to purchase U.S.-produced iron and steel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the Keystone, while not yet under construction, is nevertheless well under way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.transcanada.com/5951.html\">TransCanada has said</a> it already has purchase agreements for the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/keystone-pipeline-american-steel-trumps-repeated-promises/story?id=45898255\">660,000 tons</a> of steel it will use for the Keystone XL. Half is to come from the Arkansas plant of an India-based steelmaker, 10 percent from a plant in India and the rest imported from Canada and Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/19/trump-plans-executive-order-on-steel-imports-237383\">reportedly</a> will sign an executive order directing the Commerce Department to investigate whether steel imports into the United States should be blocked on national security grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While mentioning the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, Trump said: &quot;All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House made it clear weeks earlier that a memorandum signed by Trump related to the use of American steel does not apply to the Keystone -- only to new pipeline projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And though the memorandum could put pressure on pipeline companies to use American steel, it does not contain any requirements that only American steel be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>div class=&#39;artembed&#39;&gt;See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-19T18:13:44.155028", "ruling_date": "2017-04-20T12:16:32", "ruling_headline": "While mentioning Keystone XL, Donald Trump errs in saying pipelines must use only American steel", "ruling_headline_slug": "while-mentioning-keystone-xl-donald-trump-errs-say", "ruling_link_text": "Memo he signed has limited effect, doesn't apply to Keystone", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WTMJ-TV, <a href=\"http://www.wtmj.com/shows/wisconsins-afternoon-news/video-pres-trump-1-on-1-with-charles-benson\">video</a> of Donald Trump interview, April 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, special assistant to the president and assistant communications director Steven Cheung, April 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA Today, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/03/04/president-trump-keystone-pipeline-american-steel/98734238/\">&quot;Keystone XL pipeline will not use U.S. steel despite Trump&#39;s vow,&quot;</a> March 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN Money, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/03/news/companies/trump-keystone-pipeline-american-steel/\">&quot;Despite Trump promises, Keystone pipeline won&#39;t have to use American steel,&quot;</a> March 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/keystone-pipeline-american-steel-trumps-repeated-promises/story?id=45898255\">&quot;Keystone pipeline won&#39;t have to use American steel, despite Trump&#39;s repeated promises,&quot;</a> March 3, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New York, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/apr/16/kirsten-gillibrand/will-oil-keystone-xl-pipeline-stay-us/\">&quot;Will all the oil from the Keystone XL pipeline be exported?&quot;</a> April 16, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1358/approve-keystone-xl-project-and-reap-profits/\">&quot;State Department issues crucial Keystone permit,&quot;</a> March 24, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1404/use-us-steel-infrastructure-projects/\">&quot;Keystone project includes foreign steel,&quot;</a> April 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA Today, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/24/executive-order-vs-presidential-memorandum-whats-difference/96979014/\">&quot;Presidential memoranda vs. executive orders.
