Vukmir&rsquo;s campaign said the article shows Mohammed&rsquo;s &quot;opposition&quot; to the nomination of Haspel, a career CIA officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article reported on Mohammed&rsquo;s request to share six paragraphs of unspecified information about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, before the committee voted to recommend Haspel&rsquo;s confirmation. Mohammed had been captured in 2003 and tortured by the CIA. But it is not known whether Haspel was involved, directly or indirectly, in his torture, according to the article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/us/politics/gina-haspel-cia-torture-letter-senate.html\">Haspel has since</a> declared that the agency should not have undertaken its interrogation program in which al Qaeda detainees were tortured after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, according to another Times news article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article did not even mention Baldwin -- much less provide any evidence that Baldwin had any concern for Mohammed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About Baldwin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For her part, when asked the day after Vukmir&rsquo;s interview about Haspel and Vukmir&rsquo;s &quot;Terrorist Team&quot; attack, <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/ali-velshi/watch/sen-baldwin-the-way-we-re-going-to-change-this-is-when-we-tell-our-stories-1234454595674\">Baldwin said</a> on MSNBC she was on a &quot;third iteration&quot; of attempts to meet with Haspel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other points are worth noting:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Baldwin did not call for Mohammed&rsquo;s testimony to be allowed by the Senate Intelligence Committee.
