In a March 21, 2016 <a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/listen/899116\">interview</a> on Wisconsin Public Radio&rsquo;s &quot;Joy Cardin Show,&quot; Bradley said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Given her judicial philosophy, JoAnne Kloppenburg has told us she thinks it&#39;s her job to promote a more equal society. She will most definitely introduce her social and political beliefs into her decision making.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know, of course, just what Kloppenburg would do as a Supreme Court justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what has Kloppenburg said about what her job is as a judge, and about promoting a more equal society?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On her campaign website, Kloppenburg states this as being her <a href=\"https://kloppenburgforjustice.com/judicial-philosophy/\">judicial philosophy</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I apply the law fairly, and thoughtfully, and in a principled and disciplined manner to answer the legal questions presented by the parties in a case. I approach each case with an open mind, and my decisions are based on the law and the facts, not on ideology or partisan politics. I am faithful to the court&rsquo;s role as an independent check and balance on the other political branches of government. My duty is to uphold the Constitution, a sacred document that represents the will of the people and which contains the fundamental principles that define our democracy, protect individual rights and promote a more equal society.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She made a <a href=\"http://www.grassrootsnorthshore.com/kloppenburg\">similar statement</a> in a candidate questionnaire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Bradley&rsquo;s campaign noted to us, Kloppenburg <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/bradley-kloppenburg-debate-judicial-philsophy-at-milwaukee-bar-association/article_25fa38b6-0a51-54f1-bc66-d1a8d0e8da4e.html\">has also said</a> -- <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=360475\">more than once</a> -- that among U.S. Supreme Court justices, <a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/state-supreme-court-candidates-make-their-case-counties-association\">she aligns</a> most with Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in part because they believe in &quot;protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Kloppenburg&rsquo;s statement is more broad than Bradley suggests, in that she states her job as a judge is to uphold the U.S. Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kloppenburg also states that in her judicial philosophy, the key principles of the Constitution&nbsp;are protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society.
