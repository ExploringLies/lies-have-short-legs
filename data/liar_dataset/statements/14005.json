Facebook users flagged the story as being possibly false, as part of the social media site&rsquo;s efforts to curb fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post, which is fake, said the flight attendant on a flight from New York to Chicago had asked the parents of a 7-month-old boy several times to &quot;quiet that annoying a--&nbsp;baby down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After four attempts, the attendant reportedly grabbed the child from its mother&rsquo;s arms and slapped him in the face. The crew member had to be restrained and the plane made an emergency landing in Missouri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the date on the story sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s the same day a doctor named David Dao was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/14/andrew-napolitano/united-airlines-passenger-had-every-right-stay-pla/\">forcibly removed from a United flight</a> for not giving up his seat to help transport United employees from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. The story ignited a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/travel/united-customer-dragged-off-overbooked-flight/\">firestorm of backlash on social media</a> and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since March, the airline has had a run of events that have cast it in a bad light. There was a furor over two teens denied a flight <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/us/united-airlines-leggings.html?_r=0\">because they were wearing leggings</a>. After the Dao incident, a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/health/scorpion-united-airlines-flight-trnd/\">scorpion stung a passenger</a> on a flight from Houston to Calgary, Canada. Most recently, a couple from Salt Lake City alleged they were <a href=\"http://www.khou.com/news/local/bride-and-groom-booted-off-united-flight-in-houston/431644313\">kicked off a plane for no justifiable reason</a> on their way to a Costa Rican wedding and honeymoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fictional post on Now8News.com no doubt was timed to capitalize on Dao&rsquo;s removal, laying blame on United for yet another PR disaster &mdash; but this one never happened. Now8News.com is a fake site designed to resemble a legitimate TV station&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no indication on Now8News.com that it posts fabricated content, although its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/Now8News-1031069457019559/about/?ref=page_internal\">Facebook page notes that it publishes</a> &quot;what the Main Stream Media won&#39;t tell you, and a little BS too.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact has written about the site before, when it&nbsp;posted a fake story that said a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/06/blog-posting/story-19-white-women-killed-black-lives-matter-sup/\">Black Lives Matter supporter had killed 19 white women</a> and hidden their mutilated bodies in a freezer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This made-up story looked to draw in readers by piling on a controversial incident on a United flight. Readers no doubt would be fooled into thinking this was real, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Pants On Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-18T14:16:38.605430", "ruling_date": "2017-04-18T14:39:21", "ruling_headline": "Fake news story says United flight attendant slapped baby during flight from Chicago", "ruling_headline_slug": "fake-news-story-says-united-flight-attendant-slapp", "ruling_link_text": "A fabricated dig at the beleaguered airline", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Now8News.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://now8news.com/united-airlines-flight-attendant-slaps-crying-baby/\">United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight</a>,&quot; April 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/us/united-airlines-leggings.html?_r=0\">After Barring Girls for Leggings, United Airlines Defends Decision</a>,&quot; March 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/06/blog-posting/story-19-white-women-killed-black-lives-matter-sup/\">Story of 19 white women killed by Black Lives Matter supporter is fake news</a>,&quot; April 6, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/travel/united-customer-dragged-off-overbooked-flight/\">Backlash erupts after United passenger gets yanked off overbooked flight</a>,&quot; April 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/14/andrew-napolitano/united-airlines-passenger-had-every-right-stay-pla/\">Did the United Airlines passenger have &#39;every right&#39; to stay on the plane?</a>,&quot; April 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/13/health/scorpion-united-airlines-flight-trnd/\">What next?
