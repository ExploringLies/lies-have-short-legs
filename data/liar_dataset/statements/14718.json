It wrongly identified the alleged shooter as Raymond Peter Littleberry. Law enforcement officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5053013/Devin-Kelley-outcast-preached-atheism.html\">media reports</a> quoted acquaintances of Kelley describing the man as an avowed atheist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the fake news article&rsquo;s claim that atheism motivated the attack was undercut by law enforcement officials who said religion was not a factor, and that the shooting appeared to stem from a &quot;domestic situation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was a domestic situation going on with this family. The suspect&#39;s mother-in-law attended this church. We know that she had received threatening texts from him,&quot; Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told reporters in a Nov. 6 press conference. Martin added the shooting &quot;wasn&#39;t over religious beliefs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake news article portrayed the perpetrator as &quot;a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea&quot; who organized Black Lives Matter protests and gay pride parades. It noted that the shooter &quot;was on the DNC payroll,&quot; in reference to the Democratic National Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s completely false,&quot; DNC spokesman Michael Tyler told PolitiFact of the alleged connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freedumjunkshun aims to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its satire for truth. &quot;Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate,&quot; its disclaimer reads. &quot;Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won&rsquo;t find any of it here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake story was wrong to say that Kelley was on the DNC payroll, and authorities said his religious beliefs do not appear to have been a factor in the shooting.
