Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was among officials who attended an event announcing the five-year gift. She made this comment:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We know that right now United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany leaders have long lamented the science and math performance of U.S. students compared with that of students in other countries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we wondered about Kleefisch&rsquo;s 25th out of 29 comment. It was picked up in a news <a href=\"http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/114229439.html\">report</a> by WTMJ-TV and repeated in a <a href=\"http://www.rebeccaforreal.com/ge-foundation-to-support-mps/\">blog </a><a href=\"http://www.rebeccaforreal.com/ge-foundation-to-support-mps/\">post</a> on Jan. 26, 2011 on Kleefisch&rsquo;s website, <a href=\"http://www.rebeccaforreal.com/\">RebeccaForReal.com</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKleefisch&rsquo;s aide, Jeanne Tarantino, said the Republican lieutenant governor based her comment on talking points provided by GE, including one that was similar to what Kleefisch said: &quot;U.S. students rank 25th out of the 29 developed nations for preparedness in math and science.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe could see how Kleefisch might have misspoken by saying &quot;developing&quot; rather than &quot;developed&quot; countries; the U.S. certainly would be in the developed category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut even at that, does the U.S. really rank near the bottom in science and math?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGE told us the source of its talking points was a U.S. Department of Education <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011004.pdf\">summary</a> of the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.pisa.oecd.org/pages/0,2987,en_32252351_32235731_1_1_1_1_1,00.html\">Programme for International Student Assessment</a>. PISA, as it is known, is a ranking of 15-year-olds <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/111551059.html\">based on international tests</a>. The 2009 <a href=\"http://www.pisa.oecd.org/document/61/0,3746,en_32252351_32235731_46567613_1_1_1_1,00.html\">results</a> were released in December 2010, about a month before the grant was announced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tContrary to Kleefisch&rsquo;s statement, PISA does not do a science-math combination ranking; they do not do a ranking of 29 countries (developed or otherwise); and they do not rank the U.S. 25th in science or math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe confirmed those points with <a href=\"http://ies.ed.gov/staff/staffdetl.asp?empid=579\">Holly Xie</a>, author of the Education Department summary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPISA assesses science and math separately and it does so with two sets of rankings. One is for 34 industrialized countries and the other is for 65 entities -- 60 countries plus five other educational systems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how does the U.S. rank?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Education Department summary:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIn science literacy, Finland ranked first and the U.S. essentially tied for 13th among the 34 industrialized countries (as its score was &quot;not measurably different&quot; from a number of other countries). However, if the actual scores are used, the U.S. ranked 17th. In the larger group of 65, Shanghai-China ranked first and the U.S. tied for 19th.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;So, in science, the U.S. ranked in the top half of industrialized countries and even higher in the larger group.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIn math literacy, Korea ranked first and the U.S. essentially tied for 18th among the 34 industrialized countries. Again, the U.S. score was &quot;not measurably different&quot; from a number of other countries. However, if the actual scores are used, the U.S. was tied for 25th.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the larger group of 65, Shanghai-China ranked first and the U.S. tied for 24th.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, in math, the U.S. ranked in the lower half of industrialized countries and much better in the larger group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKleefisch said U.S. students &quot;are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math.&quot; We assume she meant &quot;developed&quot; rather than &quot;developing&quot; countries. But her point was that U.S. students ranked near the bottom in science and math.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe test results cited, however, do not include a science-math combination ranking. What they show is the U.S. ranks in the top half of industrialized countries in science; in math, it&rsquo;s in the lower half, but not near the bottom.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndeed, after we requested additional information from GE, the company told us Feb. 4, 2011, that it erred in saying the U.S. ranks 25th of 29 countries in science and math.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Kleefisch&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-03T19:50:05.751090", "ruling_date": "2011-02-06T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Lt.
