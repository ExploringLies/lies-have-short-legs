Glenn Hegar of Katy, took pride in big cuts to public education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIWVWHxFY6s\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>In Collier&rsquo;s ad</u></a>, the narrator says Hegar &quot;voted to cut more than $5 billion from Texas schools, money for teachers, computers, &nbsp;even books -- all cut.&quot; This was a reference to actions taken by the Republican-majority 2011 Legislature in the face of a multi-billion-dollar projected revenue shortfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And Hegar is proud of it,&quot; Collier&rsquo;s narrator says. Next, the ad shows Hegar saying: &quot;Some people are saying, &#39;Oh, we&rsquo;ve put more money into education.&rsquo; No we didn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no way you can spin that. No we didn&rsquo;t. But I was not ashamed to say we didn&rsquo;t. I was proud that we did not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We waded into this after noticing a news account with a dash of doubt about why Hegar was proud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily shock if Hegar took pride. In June 2011, he issued a <a href=\"http://www.hegar.senate.state.tx.us/pr11/p061011a.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>press release</u></a> expressing pride in lawmakers balancing the 2012-13 budget in the face of a projected $27 billion revenue shortfall without tapping the rainy day fund or raising taxes; his release called the result &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;remarkable.&quot; And while Hegar made no direct reference to the school cuts, he hailed &quot;a fiscally sound and responsible budget that funds essential services and forces state government to live within its means, just as Texas families must do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Collier spokeswoman Chaille Jolink said Collier based his claim on Hegar&rsquo;s comments some 38 minutes into his videotaped 2013 meeting with the Montgomery County Tea Party, which was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp9XimysFfc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=38m5s\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>posted on YouTube</u></a> Dec. 31, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roll tape!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a question-and-answer period with group members, Hegar said he favors delivering education smarter and cheaper, perhaps online. The comptroller plays a role managing dollars, he said. &quot;You&rsquo;re really the watchdog for the taxpayers,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our transcribed excerpt picks up with a member&rsquo;s follow-up comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Montgomery County Tea Party</strong>: &quot;I think our whole education system needs to come under an audit because there&rsquo;s somebody getting a lot of money and it&rsquo;s not teachers. And education isn&rsquo;t getting any better.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hegar (nodding)</strong>: &quot;Whenever -- I mentioned this to somebody the other day -- I said that whenever we did the cut; you mentioned earlier (gesturing away from the questioner) the cuts to education, and some people went out and said -- (gesturing in another direction) it was almost like your question earlier, was the budget balanced or was it not balanced? -- some people were saying oh, we&rsquo;ve put more money into education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No we didn&rsquo;t (shaking head back and forth). There&rsquo;s no way you can spin that. No, we didn&rsquo;t. But I was not ashamed to say we didn&rsquo;t. I was proud that we did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I had a lot of&quot; school district &quot;superintendents come up to me and tell me, you know what, thanks, because I&rsquo;ve been needing to cut something over here and I&rsquo;ve never been able to and you gave me the excuse. Now one, I&rsquo;m about to jump on you because you just told me you wanted to and you should have, but you didn&rsquo;t?&hellip; It really opened my eyes when somebody would say that we really needed to cut this stuff but I didn&rsquo;t have a good excuse and you just gave it to me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MCTP</strong>: &quot;So you were a scapegoat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hegar</strong>: &quot;That&rsquo;s fine. I was happy to be the scapegoat; it didn&rsquo;t bother me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We let Hegar&rsquo;s campaign know we were checking on his declaration of pride. Spokesman David White emailed us a statement saying: &quot;As a father of three children in public schools, Sen. Hegar believes in adequately funding our education system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White also urged us to read an Aug. 8, 2014 <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2014/08/collier-hegar-bragged-to-tea-party-hes-proud-of-school-cuts.html/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news blog post</u></a> by the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> presenting a slightly different recap of Hegar&#39;s comments to the tea-party group. White then said Collier presented Hegar&rsquo;s remarks &quot;out of context.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the tea-party video, the <em>News</em>&rsquo; story said, Hegar &quot;recounts what apparently are constituent comments about last year&rsquo;s restoration of nearly $4 billion of the earlier cuts. That&rsquo;s when he says he was proud not to have &lsquo;put more money in education. &hellip; There&rsquo;s no way you could spend that.&rsquo;&quot; In our views of the video, we didn&rsquo;t hear the senator referring to money restored. Also, we heard Hegar&rsquo;s latter remark as: &quot;There&rsquo;s no way you can spin that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collier said Hegar was proud to cut public school funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, Hegar said he was unashamed and proud to stand behind the cuts that Republicans passed into law. We rate Collier&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-27T15:49:53.433596", "ruling_date": "2014-09-05T17:35:48", "ruling_headline": "Mike Collier says opponent Glenn Hegar \"is proud of\" legislated cuts in public school funding", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-collier-says-opponent-glenn-hegar-was-proud-l", "ruling_link_text": "'I was proud'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubBclVaBLtP55lQw7TDrF1hulKkelnACIQ8LqD2SAgw/pub\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Email</u></a>, Chaille Jolink, press associate, Mike Collier campaign, Aug. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press release, <a href=\"http://www.hegar.senate.state.tx.us/pr11/p061011a.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Senator Hegar Declares 82nd Legislative Session a Success for Taxpayers and Texas Families,&quot;</u></a> state Sen.
