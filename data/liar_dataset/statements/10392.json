Nathan Deal tried to rectify in his State of the State speech on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Georgia is now the eighth most populous state in the nation, moving from the number 10 position in just four years,&quot; Deal said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political junkies know that with more people comes, at the very least, more Congressional seats. Or, as Deal would have it, evidence that a state is creating jobs and drawing top talent from around the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But looking at just the data, is Deal right on the numbers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question of population falls to the U.S. Census Bureau, which in addition to conducting the decennial count that determines Congressional representation also releases annual population estimates for each state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest, pegged to July 1, estimated that 10,097,343 live in Georgia. That&rsquo;s an increase of 102,584 from 2013, or a little bit larger than the city of Sandy Springs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the first time Georgia reached the milestone of 10 million residents, and it puts the Peach State in 8th place among all states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means Deal is right on the first part of his statement. But he&rsquo;s off when comparing to four years ago, and the numbers from the 2010 Census.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Way back when Betty White was a mere 88 years old, and &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; first showed what could happen to Georgia in a zombie apocalypse, the state had 9,687,653 people, Census data show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That put Georgia in ninth place in terms of population, just behind Michigan but one slot ahead of neighboring North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about Deal&rsquo;s bigger point, that our growth is a signal of greater economic development? There, the same data can back him up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2014 Census data makes it look as if North Carolina surpassed Michigan in the latest counts. It did &ndash; but Georgia surged past Michigan first, said Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&rsquo;ll see it occasionally that a state will surpass another,&quot; Bernstein said. &quot;What&rsquo;s significant here is Michigan was leapfrogged twice, by both Georgia and North Carolina.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of that shift is undoubtedly for jobs. The recent announcement that Mercedes-Benz USA will move its headquarters to metro Atlanta does not take people from Michigan, long the home to the nation&rsquo;s auto industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is another example of the gradual creation of the Southeast as the industry&rsquo;s new hub. Chris Carr, the commissioner of Georgia&rsquo;s Department of Economic Development, said Georgia had earlier lost out to Alabama for Mercedes&rsquo; new manufacturing plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the state left a good enough impression for the firm to consider it for its new headquarters, in part because Georgia&rsquo;s growth is good for customers and workers alike, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When companies are looking for a place to go, they need the right business climate but they want to make sure they are taking care of their employees and have a great place to live, too,&quot; Carr said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is a psychological impact that we are growing, that shows people there is a reason to be here,&quot; Carr said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the point Deal was trying to make, when he claimed Georgia is now the 8th most populous state and moved up two spots in just four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor was off on the state&rsquo;s ranking four years ago. We only moved up one spot. But he is right about where the state&rsquo;s population is now &ndash; and how that population can tie to jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Deal&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-01-15T14:44:24.376950", "ruling_date": "2015-01-16T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Deal a little off on the numbers but right on the point", "ruling_headline_slug": "little-numbers-right-point", "ruling_link_text": "Don't let anyone tell you size doesn't matter", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Georgia Gov.
