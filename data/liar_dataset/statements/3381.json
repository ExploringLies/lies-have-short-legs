To date, the agency never implemented a utilization management program for outpatient diagnostic services. Proviso language is only valid for one year. The last time the above-mentioned proviso was in the General Appropriations Act was Fiscal Year 2008-09. It is uncertain if the agency would still have authority to implement such a program. The agency is unable to provide an independent study or other supporting data which would validate significant savings to the Medicaid program if such a $18,000,000.00 program were implemented.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe caveat here is that while the governor instituted the freeze for the offices he controls, many state agencies were not asked to comply, including those led by members of the Florida Cabinet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Jan. 14, the three members of the Cabinet, all Republicans -- Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam -- told the <em>Times</em> that they would not comply with Scott&#39;s request to have pending regulations in their offices frozen and then reviewed by the governor&#39;s office before becoming effective.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We are not sending our rules to the governor&#39;s office,&quot; Atwater spokesman Sterling Ivey said. &quot;We are looking at all of our rules internally to make sure they align with the direction the commissioner wants to go with the department.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tScott is right that he froze regulations and certain contracts upon taking office. But it didn&#39;t apply to all state agencies, and we&#39;ve only found one contract that&#39;s actually been denied since the freeze took effect.
