Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being false, as part of the social media website&rsquo;s efforts to curtail fake news in users&rsquo; news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story said 39-year-old Rasheed Thompson was arrested in Chicago after neighbors reported suspicious activity. Police supposedly found the bodies while searching Thompson&rsquo;s home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post is made up, and it has changed a bit since first appearing early in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest version we found was <a href=\"http://now8news.com/garage-freezer-black-lives-matter/\">posted on the fake news site</a> Now8News.com, going back to at least Feb. 18, 2016. It was set in Los Angeles, and involved a man identified only as &quot;Mathis,&quot; who hid 12 white women&rsquo;s bodies in a freezer marked &quot;Black Lives Matter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That was followed up the same month by EmpireHerald.com, which wrote the version about Chicago&rsquo;s Thompson killing 19 women.

It first started promoting the story the same day as the News8Now.com post.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This version of the story <a href=\"http://viralmugshot.com/police-find-19-white-female-bodies-in-freezers-with-black-lives-matter-carved-into-skin/\">ended up</a> <a href=\"http://im-american.net/police-find-19-white-female-bodies-in-freezers-with-black-lives-matter-carved-into-skin/\">on several</a> <a href=\"https://radiosong94.wordpress.com/tag/chicago/\">other websites</a> <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.media/post/5707372/police-find-19-white-female-bodies-in-freezers-with-black-lives?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">throughout</a> <a href=\"http://phillystreetstalk.com/phillyst_PST/dead-bodies-found-carved-with-black-lives-matter/\">the year</a>. None of the websites identified the story as fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the photographs often used to illustrate the story are of freezers really used to hide bodies, but aren&rsquo;t of the fictional Thompson or his victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One image showed a chest freezer used by a Japanese man who strangled his wife and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2152213/Company-boss-strangled-wife-death-kept-fully-clothed-body-freezer-fish-processing-plant-TEN-YEARS.html\">hid the body for a decade</a>.
