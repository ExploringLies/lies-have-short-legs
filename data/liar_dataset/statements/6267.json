Each of these forms is lengthy and, unless you&#39;re an accountant, difficult to decipher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, the question of whether the Obama campaign is correct to say that Romney &quot;had millions in a Swiss bank account&quot; is not in doubt, since the trustee for the Romney family&rsquo;s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray -- acknowledged it in an on-the-record call with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMalt said on the call, &quot;Yeah, it occurs to me that one other question that came up. &hellip; &nbsp;Why is there a Swiss bank account listed on the Romney&#39;s tax return? It is listed because I set that account up for diversification in 2003, when I became trustee of the blind trusts. It is a bank account. Nothing more, nothing less. An ordinary bank account. It earns some income, which is fully reported on the Form 1040 in the (2010) tax return. You&#39;ll see approximately $1,700 of interest earned by this account, which is reported. The tax is fully paid just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMalt added, &quot;By the way, I did close this account in early 2010. It no longer exists.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReporters on the call offered two follow-up questions about the Swiss bank account. One asked, &quot;Why was that Swiss bank account closed in 2010?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMalt responded, &quot;I previously said that I regularly review Gov. Romney&#39;s investments and just in connection with one of my periodic reviews, I decided that this account wasn&#39;t serving any particular purpose. It might or might not be consistent with Gov. Romney&#39;s political views. You know, again, taxes were all fully paid, etc., but it just wasn&#39;t worth it, and I closed the account.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second question asked the Romney camp to &quot;elaborate on which institution held the Swiss account, how much the account held and whether the account also worked with any trusts or foundations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMalt responded that &quot;the Swiss bank account was in the Ann Romney blind trust. It held approximately $3 million. It was just an investment of the trust -- the bank account of the trust -- which, as I mentioned, I have subsequently closed. The bank was, sorry, Union Bank Switzerland -- UBS.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMalt&rsquo;s comments confirm that Romney &quot;had millions in a Swiss bank account&quot; because the couple filed their returns jointly, and the campaign has disclosed tax returns for Ann Romney&rsquo;s trusts and family trusts, not just Romney&rsquo;s funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the Romney campaign also <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/romney-failed-disclose-swiss-bank-account-income/story?id=15447680#.UARIY5GReXe\">retroactively disclosed</a> that the couple had a Swiss account in his 2006 presidential financial disclosure form, apparently the same one that was closed in 2010. In the 2006 disclosure form, the UBS money market account was <a href=\"http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00000286_2006_Pres.pdf\">listed</a> as being worth between $1 million and $5 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note that there&rsquo;s no indication that Romney did anything improper by having some of his assets in a Swiss bank account -- assets, we&rsquo;ll reiterate, that were placed in the account by Malt, not by Romney. The purpose of a <a href=\"http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blind%20trust\">blind trust</a> is to have a money manager make investment decisions so that a public official is protected from the appearance of a conflict of interest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign said the account was legal and disclosed to the IRS and the U.S. Treasury. Income from the account was included in the Romney&rsquo;s tax returns and all U.S. taxes due were paid during the period, the campaign said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe trustee who managed Romney&rsquo;s holdings has publicly confirmed that Mitt and Ann Romney had &quot;approximately $3 million&quot; in assets in a Swiss bank account between 2003 and 2010, and the Romney campaign did not object to that characterization when we contacted them for this story.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSwiss bank accounts may make good fodder for campaign commercials and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHNcE_d7ro\">Jason Bourne movies</a>, but there&#39;s nothing to indicate Romney did anything illegal or improper with the account. While it is now closed, the claim in Obama&rsquo;s ad was stated in the past tense -- that Romney &quot;had millions in a Swiss bank account.&quot; That&rsquo;s correct, so we rate Obama&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-16T14:13:40.999924", "ruling_date": "2012-07-16T16:39:48", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account, Barack Obama campaign ad says", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-had-millions-swiss-bank-account-barack", "ruling_link_text": "Publicly confirmed by the official who ran Romney's blind trust", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama, &quot;Firms&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud3mMj0AZZk\">campaign ad</a>), July 14, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMitt Romney presidential campaign, transcript of conference call on Mitt Romney&rsquo;s tax returns, Jan. 24, 2012 (accessed via Nexis)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitt Romney presidential campaign, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/learn/mitt/tax-return/main\">index page for tax form disclosure</a>, accessed July 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?CID=N00000286\">index page for Mitt Romney&rsquo;s presidential financial disclosure forms</a>, accessed July 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tABC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/romney-failed-disclose-swiss-bank-account-income/story?id=15447680#.UARONpGReXf\">Romney Failed to Disclose Swiss Bank Account Income</a>,&quot; Jan. 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/us/politics/romneys-swiss-account-captures-critics-fancy.html?_r=3\">Romneys&rsquo; Swiss Account Captures Critics&rsquo; Fancy</a>,&quot; Jan. 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Vanity Fair</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts\">Where the Money Lives</a>,&quot; August 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRealClearPolitics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/07/16/romney_shell_companies__offshoring_a_primer_114802-2.html\">Romney, Shell Companies &amp; Offshore Accounts: A Primer</a>,&quot; July 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWBUR, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/2012/07/09/mitt-romney-money\">The First President With A Swiss Bank Account</a>?&quot; July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tABC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/romney-parks-millions-offshore-tax-haven/story?id=15378566#.UAQoBJGReXe\">Romney Parks Millions in Cayman Islands</a>,&quot; Jan. 18, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Mitt Romney &quot;had millions in a Swiss bank account.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign ad", "statement_date": "2012-07-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
