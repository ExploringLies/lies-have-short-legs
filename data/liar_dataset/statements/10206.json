The reason? According to the administration, she is no longer useful.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;Zborknak worked at Fleur de Lis Florist in Chicago for nearly forty years, before she made the decision to retire in 1998. Since that time, she has struggled with a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot; &lsquo;Unfortunately, the cost of her care just became too expensive,&rsquo; claims Peter Johnston, a member of the Chicago PREB. &lsquo;Under the Affordable Care Act, we have the power to make choices about end of life care and I stand by our ruling. I know it will be hard for the family to accept what&rsquo;s going to happen&hellip;But from a financial standpoint, this was a very easy decision.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll offer a quick diagnosis: This claim is not accurate. Back in 2009, the myth of death panels was our inaugural <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/dec/18/politifact-lie-year-death-panels/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Lie of the Year.</u></a> Almost five years later, death panels are still not a part of U.S. health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first clue that the American News article was not real was the name of the woman who was supposedly sentenced to execution: Dorothy Zborknak. That&rsquo;s the name of &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027609/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bea Arthur&rsquo;s</u></a> character on the TV show <em>The Golden Girls</em>. (Slightly misspelled -- it&#39;s actually Zbornak.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that the story is ripped from an <a href=\"http://dailycurrant.com/2014/01/20/obamacare-death-panel-orders-execution/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>article</u></a> posted on <em>The Daily Currant </em>in January. <em>The Daily Currant </em>is a satirical website with a mission &quot;to ridicule the timid ignorance which obstructs our progress and promote intelligence,&quot; according to <a href=\"http://dailycurrant.com/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the website</u></a>. Other headlines include things like &quot;Obama Announces Two-Year Golfing Trip&quot; and &quot;Al-Qaeda Member Elected to California City Council.&quot; The debunkers at <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/media/notnews/dorothyzbornak.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Snopes.com</u></a> caught this case of copying back in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the American News site, its &quot;About Us&quot; and &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; pages have no information on them besides ads. Stories are posted without attribution or bylines. We attempted to contact them through a form on the site, but did not receive a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article was posted on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ThePatriotReview/posts/336040856586496\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Patriot</u></a> Facebook page in September and quickly spread. It has 6,019 likes&nbsp;and was shared 4,906 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who don&rsquo;t recall it, the death panel discussion stemmed from a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/sarah-palin/statementon-the-current-health-care-debate/113851103434\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>post</u></a> on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin&rsquo;s Facebook page on August 7, 2009. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama&rsquo;s &lsquo;death panel&rsquo; so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their &lsquo;level of productivity in society,&rsquo; whether they are worthy of health care,&quot; she wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no mention of such a system in the massive Affordable Care Act. &nbsp;Instead, the idea originated from changes to Medicare to cover appointments on end-of-life planning, such as living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. The appointments were not required, and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/25486.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>AARP</u></a> backed the addition. The change wasn&rsquo;t implemented after the controversy over Palin&rsquo;s comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chain email claimed that Dorothy Zborknak was ordered executed by an Obamacare death panel. We ruled on this topic five years ago, but we&rsquo;ll repeat it again: &nbsp;Death squads are not a part of the Affordable Care Act, and you can still catch Dorothy on <em>Golden Girls</em> reruns most nights.
