Since this one is new to many readers, we'll revisit some of our previous findings and address the new charge about slouching. (This is the first time we can recall slouching being used as the basis for a political attack.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The Obama photo was taken Sept. 16, 2007, in Indianola, Iowa, at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual political event hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin. The caption on the\n <i>\n  Time\n </i>\n photo says Obama and the others \"stand during the national anthem.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama was on stage with New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Harkin's wife Ruth.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the\n <i>\n  Time\n </i>\n caption indicates, the photo was taken during the national anthem, not the pledge, so the photo does not support the allegation that Obama \"turns his back and . . . slouches\" during the pledge. This is corroborated by\n <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3759803\">\n  an ABC News video\n </a>\n of the occasion.\n</p>\n<p>\n It's clear from the video that the assembled Democrats are not turning their backs on the flag to make an antipatriotic statement. They are looking at the same point &mdash; presumably the woman singing the anthem.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a matter of interpretation whether Obama is slouching as the anthem is played. The photo shows him with his hands clasped in front of his waist while the others have their hands over the heart (a point of anthem protocol that we addressed in\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2007/nov/08/obama-targeted-chain-e-mail/\">\n  this item).\n </a>\n But it doesn't look to us like he's slouching and there's no evidence to suggest his posture was making an antipatriotic statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama has responded to these allegations by saying he often leads the pledge when he presides over the Senate, as seen in\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC9veEouqqQ\">\n  this video from the Senate.\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n So once again, we find a chain e-mail is incorrect about Obama. We find the statement False.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:23.553719", "ruling_date": "2008-02-08T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "A new twist on an old distortion", "ruling_headline_slug": "a-new-twist-on-an-old-distortion", "ruling_link_text": "A new twist on an old distortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1662530_1446035,00.html\">\n Time Photo from Tom Harkin's Steak Fry\n</a>\n<p>\n U.S. Code,\n <a href=\"http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sec_36_00000301----000-.html\">\n  NATIONAL ANTHEM, MOTTO, FLORAL EMBLEM, MARCH, AND TREE\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n ABC News,\n <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2007/11/obama-says-flag.html\">\n  Obama Says Flag Flap a Dirty Trick\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n RawStory,\n <a href=\"http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Obama_doesnt_put_hand_over_heart_1022.html\">\n  No hand over heart from Obama during national anthem\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Marine Corps,\n <a href=\"http://www.unl.edu/nrotc/reference/MCO%20P10520.3B.pdf\">\n  Flag Manual\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"https://www.cnrnw.navy.mil/protocol/Navy_Social_Customs_and_Traditions.pdf\">\n  Social Customs: Traditions of the Sea Services\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n ABC News,\n <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3759803\">\n  Video of anthem at steak fry\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington Post FactChecker,\n <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2007/11/obama_nabbed_by_the_patriotic.html\">\n  Obama Nabbed by the Patriot Police\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Snopes.com,\n <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/anthem.asp\">\n  Hand Over Heart\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Interviews: Anne Garside, director of communication for the Maryland Historical Society; Elizabeth Lasko, director of public relations for the National Association for Music Education\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "\"While others place their hands over their hearts, Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches.\"", "statement_context": "a chain e-mail sent to many people.", "statement_date": "2008-01-06", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 36, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/36/", "subject": "Patriotism", "subject_slug": "patriotism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
