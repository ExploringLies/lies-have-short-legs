In a two-page critique released on Twitter, El-Shabazz referred to Briggs as a &quot;fake news reporter&quot; and accused him of racism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long statement, released Friday, also suggested Briggs had incorrectly stated the former client of El Shabazz was on death row and included this line: &quot;In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has El-Shabazz really never represented someone who was sentenced to death?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll start with Anthony Brown.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cityandstatepa.com/content/el-shabazz-was-disciplined-removed-cases-defense-attorney\">Briggs&rsquo; article</a>&nbsp;originally included the following passage: &quot;With nothing but death row ahead of him, Brown began to file state and federal court petitions largely centering around El-Shabazz&rsquo;s failure to investigate his case.&quot; According to a&nbsp;<em>Philadelphia Daily News</em>&nbsp;article from 2000, Brown was given a life sentence for the murder. State records also indicate nobody by the name Anthony Brown has been sentenced to death in Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg Salisbury, editor of&nbsp;<em>City &amp; State PA</em>, said the line about death row was a copy editing error. He said the story was corrected Monday. The above sentence now reads, &quot;With nothing but the rest of his life in prison ahead of him,&quot; and a correction is noted at the end of the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But another client of El-Shabazz, infamous drug dealer Kaboni Savage, presents a murkier picture. In 2013, Savage was given a federal death sentence for 12 counts of murder, six of which stemmed from a 2004 retaliatory fire bombing in North Philly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage during the federal case for which he received the death penalty. Salima Suswell, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz, said he was disqualified from representing Savage because of a conflict of interest and couldn&rsquo;t represent him. The conflict arose because of the earlier case in which he repped Savage. In federal court filings, El-Shabazz is not listed as an attorney for Savage in the case. The earliest motion by the defense comes from Christopher Warren, who was a court-appointed attorney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Savage wasn&rsquo;t El-Shabazz&rsquo;s client in that matter, Suswell said. &quot;So the statement stands as true.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2004&nbsp;<em>Inquirer</em>&nbsp;article indicates El-Shabazz was representing Savage when the drug dealer was already being suspected &mdash; but not yet charged &mdash; in the fire bombing. The article explains that the FBI was targeting Savage, lists El-Shabazz as his lawyer and quotes him as saying Savage had nothing to do with the firebombing &quot;directly or indirectly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the fact-check comes down to this question: Is it fair for a lawyer to say none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death when a major client of his received a death sentence in a case he didn&rsquo;t litigate after being disqualified from representing him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two legal experts say yes. Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at Penn, said given the context, El-Shabazz&rsquo;s statement is not incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s trying to prove he&rsquo;s a good lawyer,&quot; Finkelstein said. &quot;If you look at the spirit of it, it doesn&rsquo;t falsify the claim. He&rsquo;s not responsible for that guy getting the death penalty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Said Jules Epstein, a longtime trial lawyer and a professor at Temple Law, who disclosed that he knows El-Shabazz: &quot;The fact that a former client got the death penalty with a different attorney is no reflection on this lawyer whatsoever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a critical article was published about him last week, Tariq El-Shabazz released a statement Friday calling reporter Ryan Briggs racist and of publishing fake news. In his statement, El-Shabazz said the article had incorrectly claimed former client Anthony Brown was given a death sentence and that not a single client of his had ever been sentenced to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown was not given the death penalty. He received a life sentence, and&nbsp;<em>City &amp; State PA</em>&nbsp;corrected the error Monday. But a former client of El-Shabazz, Kaboni Savage, received a death sentence. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage in the federal case that led to the sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t represent Savage in that case, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz said his claim stands as true. A former trial lawyer and expert on legal ethics agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while true in a legal sense, El-Shabazz&rsquo;s statement needs clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rule the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-02T17:41:46.844471", "ruling_date": "2017-05-02T17:43:11", "ruling_headline": "Philly DA candidate blasts investigative journalism: I never repped a client on Death Row", "ruling_headline_slug": "philly-da-candidate-blasts-investigative-journalis", "ruling_link_text": "Legally true, but he could use some clarification", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Greg Salisbury,&nbsp;<em>City &amp; State PA</em>&nbsp;editor, May 2, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Salima Suswell, El-Shabazz spokesperson, May 1, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at Penn, May, 2, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Jules Epstein, Temple Law professor, May 2, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, &quot;Accused drug kingpin whines to judge,&quot;&nbsp;<em>Philadelphia Daily News</em>, May 6, 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, &quot;Guns, bodies and attitude,&quot;&nbsp;<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, October 17, 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cityandstatepa.com/content/el-shabazz-was-disciplined-removed-cases-defense-attorney\">El-Shabazz was disciplined, removed from cases as defense attorney</a>,&quot;&nbsp;<em>City &amp; State PA</em>, April 26, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C-ccC3zUQAAZZE6.jpg\">Tariq El-Shabazz</a>.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "DA candidate", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Tariq", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3925, "last_name": "El-Shabazz", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "tariq-el-shabazz", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Screen_Shot_2017-05-02_at_5.40.14_PM.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Pennsylvania", "edition": "Pennsylvania", "edition_slug": "pennsylvania", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 54, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Pennsylvania Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/54/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3925/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "In a statement responding to a news article", "statement_date": "2017-04-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 321, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/321/", "subject": "Death Penalty", "subject_slug": "death-penalty", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/49/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Philly DA candidate blasts investigative journalism: I never repped a client on Death Row"}
