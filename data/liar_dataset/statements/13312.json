This time, it revolved around remarks Trump made almost a year ago about a disabled reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one point in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton said, &quot;He also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump interrupted, &quot;Wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So who&rsquo;s right? Here&rsquo;s the background, which we have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/colorado/statements/2016/jun/13/priorities-usa-action/pro-clinton-super-pac-ad-trump-mocked-disabled-r/\">looked at before</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24, 2015, Trump referred to <em>New York Times</em> reporter Serge Kovaleski. At the time, Trump was taking heat for his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/nyregion/a-definitive-debunking-of-donald-trumps-9-11-claims.html?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F06%2F07%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fsuper-pac-highlights-donald-trumps-mockery-of-disabled-journalist.html&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\">widely debunked</a> claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as &nbsp;&quot;thousands and thousands of people were cheering&quot; the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To defend this account, Trump cited a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/09/18/northern-new-jersey-draws-probers-eyes/40f82ea4-e015-4d6e-a87e-93aa433fafdc/?tid=a_inl\">Sept. 18, 2001</a>, story co-written by Kovaleski, who was a <em>Washington Post</em> reporter at the time. Near the bottom of the story, the <em>Post </em>reporters wrote that &quot;law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\">reporters couldn&rsquo;t verify</a> the celebrations actually occurred, as Kovaleski later explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,&quot; Kovaleski told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\"><em>Washington Post </em>Fact Checker</a> in November 2015. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that &quot;a number of people&quot; -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the rally where he discussed Kovaleski, Trump said, &quot;You gotta see this guy&quot; and wildly flailed his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouted in a weird, agitated voice: &quot;Ahh, I don&rsquo;t know what I said! Ahh, I don&rsquo;t remember!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints and has left his right hand sharply angled at the wrist. Kovaleski speaks with a normal voice and doesn&#39;t wave his arms around. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydGOPzW227E\">Watch a video</a> of him talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many observers took Trump&rsquo;s comments and motions as mocking Kovaleski. The <em>New York Times</em> rebuked Trump in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/25/trump-blasted-by-new-york-times-after-mocking-reporter-with-disability/\">statement</a>: &quot;We think it&#39;s outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters.&quot; And people who share Kovaleski&rsquo;s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag &quot;AMCStrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, said that Trump &quot;clearly was mocking his disability. That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn&#39;t use that voice or wave his arms like that.&quot; (Reiskin said she was giving her view since her nonprofit group can&#39;t endorse or oppose candidates.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reiskin said such behavior by Trump &quot;portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can&#39;t control your speech or part of your body that you&#39;re not competent, which is very destructive&quot; to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump denied it. He tweeted, &quot;Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/669980142475845632\">statement at the time</a>, &quot;I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump insisted that he couldn&rsquo;t have known the man was disabled because &quot;I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. &hellip; Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the <em>Washington Post</em> he was sure the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/25/trump-blasted-by-new-york-times-after-mocking-reporter-with-disability/\">businessman remembered him -- and his condition</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/us/politics/donald-trump-says-his-mocking-of-new-york-times-reporter-was-misread.html?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\">Kovaleski told the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Kovaleski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the &quot;inaugural voyage&quot; of the Trump Shuttle airline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovaleski at the rally, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/11/26/donald-trump-mocks-reporter-with-disability-berman-sot-ac.cnn\">calling him a &quot;nice reporter.&quot;</a> He also described him as &quot;the poor guy&quot; and indicated he knew Kovaleski&rsquo;s appearance (&quot;you gotta see this guy&quot;) before launching into his imitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After our fact-check appeared, the <em>Washington Post</em> Fact Checker reviewed both Trump&rsquo;s original comments and subsequent ones he made on the same subject in Colorado. The Fact Checker concluded that &quot;Trump clearly mocked Kovaleski&quot; and it gave Trump its lowest rating, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/02/donald-trumps-revisionist-history-of-mocking-a-disabled-reporter/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-politics%3Ahomepage%2Fcard\">Four Pinocchios</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, some Trump supporters have shared other examples in which Trump has shaken his hands and used an odd tone of voice to refer to other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one video, Trump is shown referring to one of his primary rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, with flailing arms and an exaggerated voice. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4604reEqk0\">See it here</a>.) In another, he uses similar, if more subdued, motions when referring to an unnamed general. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQQq50JWsmY\">See it here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, neither of these examples support Trump&rsquo;s denial in the debate. In the videos, Trump was clearly mocking both Cruz and the unnamed general. In fact, the video about the general -- produced by a Trump supporter -- says explicitly that he was mocking the general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the most you could say about these bits of evidence is that they demonstrate that Trump is an equal-opportunity mocker. They don&rsquo;t help refute Clinton&rsquo;s charge that Trump mocked Kovaleski.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry after the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that Clinton is &quot;wrong&quot; to say he mocked a disabled reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump may deny that he intentionally mocked Kovaleski for his disability, but many Americans believe his remarks amounted to mocking, and we concur that that&rsquo;s a reasonable -- indeed, perhaps the only -- interpretation of his actions. The notion that Trump&rsquo;s comments about Cruz and a general undercut Clinton&rsquo;s claim don&rsquo;t hold water, because all three examples constitute mocking, whether a disability was involved or not. We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-20T01:16:15.253940", "ruling_date": "2016-10-20T01:31:03", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton is 'wrong' to say he mocked a disabled reporter", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wrong-say-he-moc", "ruling_link_text": "Let's go to the tape", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, remarks in the third presidential debate, Oct. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Colorado, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/colorado/statements/2016/jun/13/priorities-usa-action/pro-clinton-super-pac-ad-trump-mocked-disabled-r/\">Pro-Clinton Super PAC ad says Trump &#39;mocked&#39; disabled reporter; evidence supports claim</a>,&quot; June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em> Fact Checker, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/08/02/donald-trumps-revisionist-history-of-mocking-a-disabled-reporter/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-politics%3Ahomepage%2Fcard\">Donald Trump&rsquo;s revisionist history of mocking a disabled reporter</a>,&quot; Aug. 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4604reEqk0\">Donald Trump comments on Ted Cruz</a>, accessed Oct. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQQq50JWsmY\">Donald Trump comments on an unnamed general</a>, accessed Oct. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, Serge Kovaleski &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydGOPzW227E\">Connecting Crime Scenes Present to Past</a>,&quot; July 2, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/nyregion/a-definitive-debunking-of-donald-trumps-9-11-claims.html?version=meter+at+0&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F06%2F07%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fsuper-pac-highlights-donald-trumps-mockery-of-disabled-journalist.html&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click\">A Definitive Debunking of Donald Trump&rsquo;s 9/11 Claims</a>,&quot; November 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/09/18/northern-new-jersey-draws-probers-eyes/40f82ea4-e015-4d6e-a87e-93aa433fafdc/?tid=a_inl\">Northern New Jersey Draws Probers&#39; Eyes</a>,&quot; September 18, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/22/donald-trumps-outrageous-claim-that-thousands-of-new-jersey-muslims-celebrated-the-911-attacks/\">Trump&rsquo;s outrageous claim that &lsquo;thousands&rsquo; of New Jersey Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks</a>,&quot; November 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/669980142475845632\">Donald J.
