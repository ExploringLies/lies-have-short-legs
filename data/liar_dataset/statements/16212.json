The piece seems to be based on another story that&rsquo;s quoted in the article and attributed to MSN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Gun-carrying civilian groups and border vigilantes have heard a call to arms in President Trump&rsquo;s warnings about threats to American security posed by caravans of Central American migrants moving through Mexico,&quot; the excerpt says. &quot;They&rsquo;re packing coolers and tents, oiling rifles and tuning up aerial drones, with plans to form caravans of their own and trail American troops to the border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out that story, though published on <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/us-militia-groups-head-to-border-stirred-by-trump%E2%80%99s-call-to-arms/ar-BBPiGxA\">MSN&rsquo;s website</a>, is actually by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-militia-groups-head-to-border-stirred-by-trumps-call-to-arms/2018/11/03/ff96826c-decf-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html?utm_term=.abe17d1dba66\">The Washington Post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newspaper goes on to report that Shannon McGauley, president of the Texas Minutemen, was then preparing to head from the Dallas area for the Rio Grande to defend the country against what Trump has called &quot;an invasion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McGauley said the Texas Minutemen have 100 volunteers on their way to the Rio Grande &quot;who want to help stop the migrants, with more likely on the way,&quot; according to the Post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McGauley said he couldn&rsquo;t put a number on how big the group will ultimately be. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 2, the Washington Post also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/army-assessment-of-migrant-caravans-undermines-trumps-rhetoric/2018/11/02/78b9d82a-dec0-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html?utm_term=.b34160d2732c\">reported</a> that U.S. military leaders are concerned about the presence of &quot;unregulated armed militia&quot; groups turning up in areas where U.S. troops will operate. The paper couldn&rsquo;t independently confirm the report&rsquo;s authenticity, the story says, &quot;but military officials did not dispute its veracity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Army documents obtained by Newsweek and <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-migrant-caravan-border-troops-1196855\">published on its website</a> on Nov. 1 report an &quot;estimated 200 unregulated armed militia members currently operating along the southwest border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rumblings about militia groups trying to stop the migrant caravan date back to at least late October. The Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/6cb0dae384cd45ddb9efe49a6aab1789\">reported</a> that month that militia members and far-right activists were raising money and airing plans to head to the border. Border Patrol warned some Texas landowners that &quot;possible armed civilians&quot; could come onto their property because of the caravan, according to the AP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 4, Willamette Week, an alternative newspaper in Portland, <a href=\"https://www.wweek.com/news/2018/11/04/oregon-militia-members-say-theyre-traveling-to-the-border-to-confront-the-migrant-caravan/\">reported</a> that, like the Texas Minutemen, Oregon militia members say they&rsquo;re also going to the border. But the weekly cautioned against reading too much into the claims of militia members. It cited <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjmacnab/status/1059192085289426944\">a tweet</a> from <a href=\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/jj-macnab\">J.J. MacNab</a>, an expert on U.S. paramilitary militia groups and anti-government extremist organizations: &quot;Reporters should keep in mind that militia members talk tough online but rarely actually show up,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.J. Tobia, a producer for VICE News Tonight, piggybacked on that sentiment, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PJTobia/status/1059212812000456705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1059212812000456705&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wweek.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F11%2F04%2Foregon-militia-members-say-theyre-traveling-to-the-border-to-confront-the-migrant-caravan%2F\">tweeting</a>: &quot;I spoke to a lot of militia folks this week.

Still, news reports indicate that action is afoot, even if it&rsquo;s just collecting cash for the cause.
