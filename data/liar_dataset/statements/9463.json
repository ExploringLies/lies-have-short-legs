There were 12 <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_52044.htm\"><u>founding members</u></a>, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new allies <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/history/nato-history.html\"><u>agreed</u></a> that &quot;an armed attack against one or more of them &hellip; shall be considered an attack against them all&quot; and that following such an attack, each would take &quot;such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2004 through 2011, NATO <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_51978.htm\"><u>provided training</u></a> in Iraq, helping the country develop its armed forces. More recently there has been a <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37768.htm\"><u>focus</u></a> on the Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. About a week before Ryan gave his speech, NATO&#39;s top official <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/nato-military-aid-ukraine/25409240.html\"><u>said</u></a> the alliance would finalize a package to modernize Ukraine&#39;s armed forces following Russia&#39;s annexation of the ex-Soviet republic&#39;s Crimea territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alliance is heavily dependent on the United States. According to NATO&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/stock_publications/20140123_SG_AnnualReport_2013_en.pdf\"><u>latest annual report</u></a>, for 2013, U.S. defense expenditures accounted for nearly three-fourths of all NATO member defense expenditures:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United States -- 73 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Kingdom -- 6.6 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France -- 4.9 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany -- 4.7 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2007, the U.S. share has increased, from 68 percent, while the overall share from European members has decreased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ryan&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Ryan&rsquo;s claim, his office cited the 2013 annual report. It notes that NATO members &quot;have collectively agreed to two guidelines to help encourage an equitable sharing of roles, risks and responsibilities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the guidelines, or goals, as the report also calls it, is that members &quot;should devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece met the 2 percent goal in 2013, the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_topics/20140224_140224-PR2014-028-Defence-exp.pdf\"><u>newer NATO figures</u></a>, released in February 2014, show that a fourth member -- Estonia -- also met the 2 percent benchmark:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>NATO member</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Amount spent on defense</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Percentage of gross domestic product spent on defense</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>United States</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$735.2 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>4.4</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>United Kingdom</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$60.3 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.4</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Greece</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$5.67 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.3</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Estonia</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$479 million</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>The day before Ryan gave his speech, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called for European allies to increase their defense spending, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/10/uk-ukraine-crisis-nato-idUKKBN0EL1RY20140610\"><u>noting</u></a> that since Estonia had met the 2 percent goal, he expected other nations could also do so.
