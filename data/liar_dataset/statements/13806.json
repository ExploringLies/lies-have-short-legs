The site describes itself as a <a href=\"http://www.blackinsurancenews.com/about/\">source of insurance industry news</a> for minority communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story, which is made up as well as outdated, says Porter called President Barack Obama a &quot;fake president&quot; and referred to the Civil War as &quot;the War of Northern Aggression.&quot; In addition to the quote in the headline, the post claims Porter also said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It&rsquo;s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/nras-president-penchant-bold-words-060450994.html\">described Porter in 2013</a> as having &quot;a penchant for bold statements.&quot; He told NRA supporters before officially taking office that they were part of a &quot;culture war&quot; that was bigger than just gun rights. Porter was <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20150413/allan-d-cors-elected-president-of-the-nra\">succeeded as NRA president in 2015</a> by Allan Cors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BlackInsuranceNews.com post was flagged by Facebook as possibly being fake as part of the social media company&rsquo;s efforts to weed out fake stories in its news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BlackInsuranceNews.com story was very popular on Facebook. It&rsquo;s been shared more than 68,000 times since being posted Monday, according to Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it actually originates from a joke site called FreeWoodPost.com, which <a href=\"http://www.freewoodpost.com/2013/05/05/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/\">first posted the story on May 5, 2013</a>, the same week Porter was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2013/05/03/meet-your-new-nra-president-a-man-still-fighting-the-civil-war-from-the-losing-side/#797d678be380\">installed as NRA president</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FreeWoodPost.com makes no secret that its contents aren&rsquo;t serious. The site&rsquo;s slogan is &quot;News that&rsquo;s almost reliable,&quot; and each post (including the one about Porter) notes beneath the text that &quot;this story is satire, folks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site <a href=\"http://www.freewoodpost.com/disclaimer/\">also has a disclaimer</a> that says FreeWoodPost.com &quot;is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.&quot; The articles &quot;are fiction, and presumably fake news,&quot; it says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BlackInsuranceNews.com, meanwhile, carries no such disclaimer.
