We found that the story was misleading because no such federal law kicked in at the end of January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blog said that the law applies to any private vehicle and that violators would face up to a $100 fine. It included a photo of a woman smoking in the driver&rsquo;s seat while children sat in the backseat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blog didn&rsquo;t explain if it was a federal or state or local law -- as evident by comments posted by confused readers who asked what jurisdictions would fall under the new law. The broad statements in the blog could leave the false impression that it refers to a federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story linked to a Feb. 1 &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/just-go-ahead-ban-smoking-everywhere-014803122.html\">Yahoo Lifestyle story</a> and lifted many paragraphs from that article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Yahoo story stated that on Jan. 30, the Alabama state House of Representatives <a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/01/house_passes_bill_to_ban_smoki.html\">passed a bill to ban smoking</a> in vehicles with any riders under the age of 19. So that means the bill itself wasn&rsquo;t enacted as a law by that date -- it still has additional legislative hurdles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However if it becomes law, Alabama would be <a href=\"http://www.no-smoke.org/learnmore.php?id=616\">the ninth state to do so</a> since 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no federal law -- or proposed federal legislation -- prohibiting smoking in vehicles with children. Alabama is one of 12 states that are considering similar bills this session, said Liz Williams, project manager for Americans for Nonsmokers&rsquo; rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blog included a few sentences describing of the type of vehicles that it applies to, which closely mirrored the wording of an announcement in July 2015 by the government of the United Kingdom,&nbsp;which banned smoking in cars with children effective Oct. 1, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lovethispic blog appears to recycle a <a href=\"http://archive.is/HmGqH/image\">similar story from 2016</a>, Snopes found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed the lovethispic blog and did not hear a reply. The headline &quot;smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018&quot; is misleading because it could lead readers to believe that a national ban started in January. In reality, the Alabama House did pass such a ban on Jan. 30, but it&rsquo;s not state law yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-07T16:16:12.163615", "ruling_date": "2018-02-08T10:33:35", "ruling_headline": "No law banned smoking in cars with children effective Jan. 30, 2018", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-law-banned-smoking-cars-children-effective-jan-", "ruling_link_text": "Some states passed laws", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Lovethispic.com,<a href=\"http://www.lovethispic.com/blog/44703/smoking-in-cars-with-children-is-illegal-starting--january-30%2C-2018\"> &quot;Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018,&quot; </a>Feb. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Nonsmokers Rights Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.no-smoke.org/learnmore.php?id=616\">Smoking in cars</a>, Accessed Feb. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alabama Legislature, <a href=\"http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/Alison/SESSBillStatusResult.ASPX?BILL=HB26&amp;WIN_TYPE=BillResult\">Bill Status for HB26 </a>, Passed House Jan. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yahoo Lifestyle, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/just-go-ahead-ban-smoking-everywhere-014803122.html\">&quot;Should we just go ahead and ban smoking everywhere?&quot;</a> Feb. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AL.com, <a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/01/house_passes_bill_to_ban_smoki.html\">&quot;House passes bill to ban smoking in cars with minors,&quot;</a> Jan. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov.UK, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/smoking-in-vehicles\">Smoking in vehicles</a>, Aug. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/01/health/alabama-smoking-in-car-bill-trnd/index.html\">&quot;Alabama could soon make it illegal for you to smoke in the car if a child is present,&quot; </a>Feb. 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/smoking-in-cars-with-children-illegal/\">&quot;Is smoking in cars with children illegal as of January 30, 2018?&quot;</a> May 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Liz Williams, Americans for Nonsmokers&#39; Rights project manager, Feb. 7, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4198, "last_name": "lovethispic.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "lovethispiccom", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup__________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4198/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.lovethispic.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2018-02-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
