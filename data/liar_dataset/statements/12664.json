Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to California&rsquo;s already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-gov-brown-signs-six-gun-control-bills-1467394282-htmlstory.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>gun control bills</u></a> introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De Le&oacute;n and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but &quot;criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started by checking the <a href=\"http://www.oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/15-0098%20%28Firearms%29_0.pdf\">text </a>of the Proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales &quot;be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor,&quot; according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the <a href=\"https://webmail.saclink.csus.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=52AXKqIW1g0heg9fasU2r_QzpjtLSAs_sGkNd30TVKTmYj5FDKnTCA..&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fsmartgunlaws.org%2fammunition-regulation-in-california%2f\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>San</u></a><u> Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or &quot;transferring&quot; ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure would:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with &quot;any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know&quot; is banned from owning or possessing ammunition;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They could still freely <em>transfer</em> and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person,&quot; Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/7096352/AP_95207980202%20(2).jpg\" style=\"height:3000px; width:2000px\" /><em>An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016.

It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coalition&rsquo;s statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would &quot;criminalize&quot; all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know they&rsquo;re not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash; The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"article__text\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; line-height: 24px; font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; font-stretch: inherit;\">\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"border-width: 0px 0px 1px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; transition:color 0.15s ease-in-out, border 0.15s ease-in-out; color: rgb(63, 99, 158); line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; border-bottom-color: transparent; border-bottom-style: solid; font-stretch: inherit;\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-10T17:42:02.513120", "ruling_date": "2016-07-12T03:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mostly False claim that California gun control measure will 'criminalize' the sharing of bullets", "ruling_headline_slug": "will-ca-gun-control-measure-criminalize-sharing-bu", "ruling_link_text": "Claim about gun control measure is a far, far stretch", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.firearmspolicy.org/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Firearms Policy Coalition</u></a>, email from coalition&rsquo;s Second Amendment Defense Committee PAC, June 16, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/15-0098%20%28Firearms%29_0.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px; text-decoration: none;\"><u>Text of Safety For All Initiative/Proposition 63</u></a>, accessed July 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Dan Newman, spokesman for Safety For All Initiative/Proposition 63, July 6, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/ammunition-regulation-in-california/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Ammunition Regulation in California</u></a>, accessed July 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sacramento Bee</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article87156147.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>How Jerry Brown acted on sweeping gun control bills</u></a>,&quot; July 1, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-gov-brown-signs-six-gun-control-bills-1467394282-htmlstory.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>&quot;</u><u>Gov.
