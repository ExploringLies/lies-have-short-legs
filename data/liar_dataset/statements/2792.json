His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe e-mail is anonymous -- isn&#39;t it always? -- but it says, in effect, that if you deposit $1,000, $10 will go to the government. If you withdraw $1,000, $10 from the balance remaining in your account will be sent to Washington. The e-mail claims that the bill, HR-4646, was introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause DeFazio is from Oregon, Oregon PolitiFact checked into the claim and reported its findings last month. Here&#39;s what they said, reprinted with a few editing changes:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill, HR-4646, is indeed actual legislation whose subject has something to do with taxation. But that&#39;s where the similarities end.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;Debt Free America Act&quot; was introduced by Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., in February 2010. He proposed a 1-percent tax on all money transactions, &quot;including cash transactions, checks, credit cards, those processed through the Federal Reserve Bank, and those collected at the point of sale.&quot; Fattah&#39;s idea was to use the money to pay down the national debt and eventually replace the income tax. He has proposed similar legislation since 2004.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHR-4646 had no support -- and certainly not from Obama&#39;s &quot;finance team&quot; -- and is now dying a quiet death in committee. Yet the resolution continues to live online, where the DeFazio connection has been repeated by a former Hernando County (Fla.) commissioner.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPenny Dodge, DeFazio&#39;s chief of staff, told PolitiFact Oregon that the congressman opposes HR-4646. An unamused DeFazio doesn&#39;t know who is behind the e-mail attack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s slanderous,&quot; DeFazio said of the electronic claim. &quot;I have nothing to do with the bill, no one pays any attention to the bill. It&#39;s chronically introduced, and never received any attention before this.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne final point about the e-mail that&#39;s been circulating in Rhode Island. It says at the beginning, &quot;You can confirm with Snopes as it is no exageration (sic),&quot; a reference to our good friends at Snopes.com, which examines the truthfulness of urban legends.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet if you actually search Snopes.com, you&#39;ll discover that the website concluded that it IS an exaggeration. That&#39;s a trend we&#39;ve been seeing a lot lately -- e-mails with bogus information that try to sound authentic by falsely claiming that Snopes has found it to be true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor all those reasons, we rate this ridiculous e-mail Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-10T17:12:03.779135", "ruling_date": "2010-11-12T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "E-mail claims Obama's finance team wants a 1-percent tax on every banking transaction", "ruling_headline_slug": "e-mail-claims-obamas-financial-team-wants-1-percen", "ruling_link_text": "Zero percent credible", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitifact.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/oct/01/chain-email/e-mail-claims-defazio-wants-tax-transactions/\" id=\"ue5o\" title=\"E-mail claims DeFazio wants to tax everyday banking transactions\">E-mail claims DeFazio wants to tax everyday banking transactions</a>,&quot; Oct. 1, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFattah.house.gov, Rep.
