In October, Donald Trump said &quot;there aren&#39;t that many women; there aren&#39;t that many children&quot; among Syrian refugees. We ranked that statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-syrian-refugees-are-mostly-men/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">The United Nations keeps track of more than 4 million registered Syrian refugees, with an <a href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>online database that includes specific demographic data</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Let&rsquo;s start by leaving out the other qualifiers &mdash; young and able-bodied &mdash; and look at whether the &quot;vast majority&quot; of refugees are men. We need not split hairs on what constitutes a &quot;vast majority&quot; here, since the gender breakdown is pretty evenly split; in hard numbers, the majority of refugees is actually female.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Further, to look at only the male refugees &ndash; which amount to 49.7 percent of the total &ndash; less than half of that population is age 18 or older. Men ages 18 to 59 comprise about 22 percent of all Syrian refugees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Contrary to Fiorina&rsquo;s statement, most refugees overall are children age 17 or younger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\"><strong>Resettlement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Geoffrey Mock, a Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, explained the situation of Syrian refugees to PolitiFact for the similar fact-check of Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">He said the sort of refugees Fiorina was talking about &ndash; young, able-bodied men &ndash; would be given a low priority for settling in the United States. President Obama<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/10/president-obama-directs-administration-to-accept-at-least-10000-syrian-refugees-in-the-next-fiscal-year/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> recommended in September</u></a> that the country take at least 10,000 refugees in the next fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">The United Nations <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/world/middleeast/un-calls-on-western-nations-to-shelter-syrian-refugees.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>recommended in April </u></a>that the U.S. and other industrialized countries shelter 130,000 Syrian refugees over the following two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">&quot;The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk,&quot; Mock told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Selected refugees undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. The process can take years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">Fiorina said the &quot;vast majority of (Syrian) refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:9pt\">She repeated the essence of a claim that wasn&rsquo;t accurate a month earlier and isn&rsquo;t accurate today.
