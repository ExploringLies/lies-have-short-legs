Bob Gibbs wants to make sure you know coal is important in Ohio&rsquo;s 18th Congressional District and that he doesn&rsquo;t like efforts to shrink the district&rsquo;s carbon footprint.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGibbs is the Republican candidate in the 18th, which includes all or parts of 15 counties in Ohio&rsquo;s Appalachian region. On his campaign website he argues that efforts to restrict carbon emissions, commonly known as Cap and Trade, would increase energy costs and be bad for the district.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;In the 18th Congressional District, 100% of electric generation comes from coal. That means that every single household in this district will see a huge increase in their energy bills if Cap-and-Trade would become law.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s true that all electricity generated in the 18th is produced at coal-fired power plants, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean when residents flick on their lights they are not also using electricity from other sources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch of the district gets power from rural electric cooperatives. Other areas, though, are serviced by FirstEnergy Corp.&rsquo;s Ohio Edison and AEP Ohio&rsquo;s Columbus Southern Power Co. and Ohio Power Co.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst Energy has ownership stakes in two nuclear power plants in Ohio and a third in Pennsylvania. AEP Ohio has two plants in Ohio that burn natural gas to generate power and a hydro-electric plant on the Ohio River.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, all power generating plants actually located within the district are coal-fired. So while the statement is not completely illuminating, we rate it as True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/07/state_sen_bob_gibbs_touts_coal.html\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-23T13:35:15.515888", "ruling_date": "2010-07-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": " House candidate Bob Gibbs touts coal's role for power generation in Ohio\u2019s 18th District", "ruling_headline_slug": "house-candidate-bob-gibbs-touts-coal-power-generat", "ruling_link_text": "But it doesn't necessarily power all the lights", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Campaign website, <a href=\"http://www.bobgibbsforcongress.com/issues\">Bob Gibbs for Congress</a>, accessed July 21, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterview Dallas Gerber of the Gibbs campaign<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterview with Shawn Bennett of the <a href=\"http://www.ohiocoal.com/\">Ohio Coal Association</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nUtility maps, <a href=\"http://www.puco.ohio.gov/puco/GIS/\">Public Utilities Commission of Ohio</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFact sheet, <a href=\"https://www.aepohio.com/global/utilities/lib/docs/factsheets/AEPOhioFactSheet2010.pdf\">AEP</a> Ohio<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNuclear power generation page, <a href=\"http://www.firstenergycorp.com/career_center/technical_training/nuclear_power_generation.html\">FirstEnergy</a> Corp.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCap and Trade, <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/capandtrade/\">U.S</a>.
