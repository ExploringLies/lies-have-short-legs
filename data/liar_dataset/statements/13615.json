This year was somewhat different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest news in the 2017 rules package was an<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jan/03/house-gops-ethics-vote-what-was-all-about-anyway/\"> amendment to curb the power</a> of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. After a big public backlash and critical tweets by President-elect Donald Trump, the amendment was withdrawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat less widely noticed, but which has <a href=\"http://www.politicususa.com/2017/01/11/gop-prohibits-cbo-reporting-aca-repeal-blows-deficit.html\">come up</a> periodically in pro-Democratic web posts and social media, was a provision that seemed to prevent the Congressional Budget Office from analyzing the cost of repealing the Affordable Care Act. If true, this would be significant, since the CBO, Congress&rsquo; number-crunching arm, is a respected independent referee on questions of how much legislative proposals will cost the federal treasury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this happened, it would make it easier for Republicans to avoid answering the question of why they want to repeal a law at significant cost to the U.S. treasury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least one lawmaker made an issue of this rules provision on Twitter:&nbsp;Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who has taken on a higher profile due to his bid to become the next Democratic National Committee chairman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal,&quot; Ellison <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keithellison/status/816967979757932544\">tweeted</a> on Jan. 5, 2017. It was retweeted more than 2,400 times and received 1,600 likes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xa43DLxlKBjpKvRLMYybxuSdlNh166Gvok0G2QJGCYybnvZBiPOHnCgw7N9QCH4KKNfkS-WgKtN4FQ3FLgCxXA7oIMv8U0SBLupZF2_Brt1UBDYhqIHCEZZlBfUYOz472U5S26xh\" style=\"border:none; height:316px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House rules package governs how the U.S. House of Representatives handles its basic procedures for the two-year duration of a congressional session. We wanted to know if it really contained what Ellison said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spoiler alert: It doesn&rsquo;t, as Ellison&rsquo;s office now acknowledges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the rules package says</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The passage in question can be found <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hres5/text\">here</a> in section 3, subsection h.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provision is laden with jargon, but the gist is this: The rules package established a new requirement for CBO to undertake an unusually long-term analysis for legislation, and then specifically freed the ACA repeal from this type of analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rules package says that &quot;the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall, to the extent practicable, prepare an estimate of whether a bill or joint resolution reported by a committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) ... would cause, relative to current law, a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-fiscal year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 fiscal years after the current fiscal year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the rule, any bills flagged as adding to the deficit by this required CBO analysis would be considered out of order, effectively sidelining them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the rules package went on to list a specific exception to this requirement, including repealing or reforming the Affordable Care Act or a portion of the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. These were the two legislative vehicles that were used to enact President Barack Obama&rsquo;s signature health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the provision actually means</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while Ellison tweeted that the package &quot;bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal,&quot; it actually doesn&rsquo;t say CBO can&rsquo;t analyze the law&rsquo;s costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, the provision in the rules package lifts the requirement that CBO track the cost of repeal or reform over the unusually long period mandated by the rules provision -- that is, 50 years after the first year CBO measures. Analyses over more typical -- and shorter -- time periods are not barred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People have misinterpreted this exemption to conclude that CBO wouldn&#39;t provide a cost estimate for ACA legislation at all,&quot; said Ed Lorenzen, a senior advisor to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a former senior aide to House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. &quot;But the exemption only applies to the new requirement for additional information regarding long-term costs in CBO estimates of legislation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congressional Budget Act requires a cost estimate covering the next 10 years for all legislation considered by Congress, he said, and &quot;the rules package doesn&rsquo;t change that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lorenzen added that the rules package doesn&rsquo;t prevent CBO from making a long-term analysis of the costs of an ACA repeal &mdash; it just says that doing such an analysis isn&rsquo;t mandatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s obviously a difference between saying something is not required and actually prohibiting it,&quot; Lorenzen said. &quot;There&rsquo;s reason to believe that CBO would probably provide information about a ballpark estimate of budgetary effects of legislation related to the Affordable Care Act beyond the 10-ten year window even without a requirement to do so, given the magnitude of the impact and interest among members of Congress in the long term budgetary effects of the ACA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lorenzen said that he and his organization would have opposed a provision of the type Ellison assumes in his tweet. &quot;But that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening here,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Wolfensberger, a former House Rules Committee aide who is now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, agreed with Lorenzen&rsquo;s analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a new point of order and exemption from it, and implicitly does not alter existing budget rules and requirements, including the ability of CBO to make cost estimates,&quot; Wolfensberger said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellison&rsquo;s office backed off after PolitiFact relayed Lorenzen&rsquo;s analysis and acknowledged that the interpretation in the tweet was incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellison tweeted that the &quot;House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, the rules package doesn&rsquo;t bar CBO analysis of ACA repeal proposals. Rather, the rules package says that CBO is not required to conduct an extra-long-term analysis that goes 50 years into the future, although the office could do one if it wants. It also doesn&rsquo;t prevent CBO from doing the more typical, 10-year analyses it does for proposed bills. We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"c0241300-f96d-4caf-b714-a2fbaa1004a6\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ClaimReview\"> <div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div> <div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"> <div itemprop=\"name\"><a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/\">Politifact</a></div> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-false.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact\" /> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\">4</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"bestRating\">6</div> <img style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-false.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" /> Politifact Rating: <div style=\"font-weight: bold\" itemprop=\"alternateName\"></div> </div> <div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\" itemprop=\"claimReviewed\">\"House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal.\"</div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 150px\"> <div itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"> <div itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <div itemprop=\"name\">Keith Ellison</div> <div itemprop=\"jobTitle\">U.S. House of Representatives, D-Minn.</div> </div> <img style=\"display:none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact/mugs/abc_keith_ellison_this_week_jt_130210_wblog.jpg\" /> <div style=\"margin: 5px 0px 0px 14px\" itemprop=\"name\">a tweet</div> <div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 14px\">Thursday, January 5, 2017</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">-01/-05/2017</div> </div> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 12px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; width: 400px;\"> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/keith-ellison/keith-ellison-wrong-cbo-cant-analyze-cost-obamacar/\" itemprop=\"url\">Read More</a> <div style=\"float: right\"> <a href=\"#\">info</a> </div> </div> </div> </div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-12T17:05:46.792535", "ruling_date": "2017-01-12T17:44:30", "ruling_headline": "Keith Ellison wrong that CBO can't analyze cost of Obamacare repeal", "ruling_headline_slug": "keith-ellison-wrong-cbo-cant-analyze-cost-obamacar", "ruling_link_text": "He acknowledges misinterpretation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Keith Ellison, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keithellison/status/816967979757932544\">tweet</a>, Jan. 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text of <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hres5/text\">House rules package</a>, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Jan. 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Gail Wilensky, head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W.
