America cannot spend &hellip; over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12,&quot; Booker said during a Dec. 9 speech in Manchester, N.H. &quot;We&#39;re not going to be able to sustain a bold economy unless we start controlling these costs.

That puts the U.S. at the top of the group for medical spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Netherlands took second place, at 12 percent of its gross domestic product.
