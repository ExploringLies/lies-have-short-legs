A &quot;deficit&quot; refers to the amount by which spending exceeds revenues. It&rsquo;s a measure calculated based on one year&rsquo;s worth of spending and revenues. (The term &quot;debt&quot; refers to the cumulative total of all previous deficits, minus all previous surpluses.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fiscal year <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls\">2011</a>, the deficit was slightly below $1.3 trillion. By the following year, it had <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43907-BudgetOutlook.pdf\">shrunk</a> to less than $1.1 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. And by 2013, the CBO <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43907-BudgetOutlook.pdf\">projects</a> a deficit of $845 billion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy year&rsquo;s end, the 2013 figure could end up being higher or lower. The deficit for 2013 could shrink due to across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, which are projected to reduce spending by an additional $85 billion in 2013. And the deficit could shrink further if tax revenues exceed their projected amount (or the deficit could expand if the economy sours and tax revenues don&rsquo;t meet expectations.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut if we allow for some uncertainty, these figures show that the deficit has declined over the past two years by about $455 billion. That&rsquo;s less than one-fifth of what Reid claimed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we contacted Reid&rsquo;s office, a spokesman pointed us to a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/626004-senator-murray-budget-memo-1-24-13.html\">memo</a> written in January 2013 by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. In this memo, Murray uses CBO figures to calculate that the deficit fell by a combined $2.4 trillion due to the two major fiscal deals of the past two years -- the legislation that ended the 2011 debt ceiling standoff and the legislation that avoided the fiscal cliff around New Year&rsquo;s Day 2013. Murray did not include the sequester cuts in this calculation. (According to Reid&rsquo;s prepared remarks, he had <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4240722\">intended to say</a> $2.4 trillion but <a href=\"about:blank\">actually said</a> $2.5 trillion on the floor.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there are some asterisks included in Murray&rsquo;s memo that Reid, in his floor speech, skipped over.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe $2.4 trillion in deficit reductions include projected savings over a 10-year period -- 2013 to 2022. In Washington budget wonkery, this is par for the course -- when bills are being debated, their fiscal impact is usually calculated over the bill&rsquo;s first 10 years of existence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Reid transformed the memo&rsquo;s headline number into a claim that &quot;in the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion.&quot; This is problematic for two reasons.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst, by using the past tense &quot;reduced,&quot; Reid implies that these deficit reductions have already taken place. Instead, they would take place in the future -- and there&rsquo;s no guarantee that they will materialize.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSecond, he said &quot;in the last two years,&quot; when in fact the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction is projected to take place over the next 10 years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I know this is oversimplifying and it doesn&rsquo;t work this way, but a 10-year deficit reduction averages out to $240 billion per year, or $480 billion over two years,&quot; said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. &quot;That&rsquo;s a big difference. Because it&rsquo;s so easy to spin the numbers, precision is critically important in budget items.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tReid said, &quot;In the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere has been some deficit reduction in recent years, but Reid&#39;s makes it sound much larger than it actually is. The $2.4 trillion number represents a projection of what is expected (but not guaranteed) to happen in the future over a 10-year period. It is not deficit reduction that has already been banked over the past two years. We rate the statement&nbsp; False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-21T11:40:35.200579", "ruling_date": "2013-03-21T14:46:26", "ruling_headline": "Harry Reid says deficit has been reduced by $2.5 trillion in past two years", "ruling_headline_slug": "harry-reid-says-deficit-has-been-reduced-25-trilli", "ruling_link_text": "Future cuts, and over 10 years, not two", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tHarry Reid, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2013-03-19/pdf/CREC-2013-03-19-pt1-PgS1914.pdf\">Senate floor speech in Congressional Record</a>, March 19, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHarry Reid, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4240722\">prepared remarks for Senate floor speech</a>, March 19, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPatty Murray, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/626004-senator-murray-budget-memo-1-24-13.html\">memo on deficit reduction</a>, Jan. 24, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOffice of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls\">Table 1.1&mdash;Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789&ndash;2017</a>,&quot; accessed March 20, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43907-BudgetOutlook.pdf\">The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023</a>,&quot; February 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, March 21, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tEmail interview with Adam Jentleson, spokesman for Harry Reid, March 20, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Senate Democratic Leader", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Harry", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Nevada", "id": 116, "last_name": "Reid", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "harry-reid", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-harryreid.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/116/", "total_count": 28, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://reid.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;In the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Senate floor speech", "statement_date": "2013-03-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
