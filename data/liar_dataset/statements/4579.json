The interview was set up in New York, where Clinton was holding the 10th annual meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative project.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found the original Newsmax.com video. The two lines quoted by American Crossroads come more than three minutes apart, as Clinton was delivering a meandering answer on how to create jobs and fix the flailing American economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen American Crossroads quoted Clinton as saying, &quot;I personally don&#39;t believe we ought to be raising taxes,&quot; they clipped Clinton&#39;s full comments short. Here&#39;s the full quote, including what American Crossroads left out:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I personally don&#39;t believe we ought to be raising taxes or cutting spending -- either one -- until we get this economy off the ground. This has been a dead flat economy. And you don&#39;t want in something this flat ... if we cut government spending, which I normally would be inclined to do when the deficit&#39;s this big, with interest rates near zero you can&#39;t get the benefits of it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Clinton was as much deriding spending cuts as he was a plan to raise taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClinton went on to praise Obama&#39;s plan to continue cuts to the payroll tax, saying it&#39;s a proven way to help the economy, before spinning off into a discussion of former President Ronald Reagan and former House Speaker Tip O&#39;Neill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater in the interview the second half of the quote comes up. But again, it&#39;s shortened.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I would pay it,&quot; Clinton said, referring to a millionaire&#39;s tax (though Clinton said that many wealthy New Yorkers like himself wouldn&#39;t be affected because they already pay high state and local income taxes that can then be deducted from your federal tax bill).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s okay with me, I&#39;d pay more,&quot; he said. &quot;But it won&#39;t solve the problem.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the American Crossroads ad was released, Clinton fired back&nbsp;saying the group wrongly implied his opposition to Obama&#39;s plan to raise taxes on the wealthy -- sometimes referred to as the &quot;Buffett Rule&quot; -- as well as Obama&#39;s jobs plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Republican group American Crossroads has used a quote from me in a video opposing President Obama&#39;s jobs plan and the &#39;Buffett Rule,&#39;&quot; he said in the statement provided to <i>POLITICO</i>. &quot;The advertisement implies that I opposed the &#39;Buffett Rule.&#39; In fact, I support both the American Jobs Act and the &#39;Buffett Rule.&#39; I believe that it&#39;s only fair to ask those of us in high-income groups -- who have received the primary benefits of the last decade&#39;s economic growth and the majority of its tax cuts as well -- to contribute to solving our long term debt problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What I did say was that the &#39;Buffett Rule&#39; cannot solve the problem alone. Reducing the debt requires three things: more economic growth, more spending cuts, and more revenue,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio defended the ad&#39;s quoting of Clinton to PolitiFact Florida, noting that a 30-second ad cannot run two-minute-plus quotes and that the &quot;quotes selected for the ad are the most succinct and relevant clips of Clinton&#39;s Newsmax interview, and fairly represent his views.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe see it differently. The ad suggests that Clinton opposes Obama&#39;s plan to raise taxes on the wealthy as a means of reducing the deficit. By our review of the interview, Clinton actually appeared to straddle that fence. At one point, he said that he didn&#39;t think the country should raise taxes &quot;until we get this economy off the ground.&quot; At another point, he said he&#39;d be &quot;okay&quot; with the tax and willing to pay it, though he said in his particular case, he probably won&#39;t be affected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the least, American Crossroads is guilty of cherry-picking parts of Clinton&#39;s statement to best fit into the narrative of its ad. But we think they go one step further by cutting out critical pieces of evidence -- namely that Clinton said he would be &quot;okay&quot; with higher taxes for the wealthy and that he&#39;d pay additional taxes if he was required to.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClinton&#39;s voice and image were no doubt selected specifically because it&#39;d be a stinging rebuke of Obama&#39;s policies -- from a fellow Democrat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut viewer beware. We rate this claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-11T12:57:30.381763", "ruling_date": "2011-10-11T14:31:44", "ruling_headline": "Bill Clinton attacks 'Buffet Rule' and President Barack Obama in new American Crossroads ad", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-clinton-attacks-buffet-rule-and-president-bar", "ruling_link_text": "Group splices Clinton's statements together", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmerican Crossroads, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjymRN--Ytk\" id=\"qzh1\" title=\"Don't\">Don&#39;t</a>,&quot;
