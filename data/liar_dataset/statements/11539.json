Republican critics of the president&rsquo;s signature health care law have focused on these failures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act, Zeke Emanuel, brother of President<strong> </strong>Barack Obama&rsquo;s former chief of staff and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, downplayed the bad news on MSNBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed,&quot; Emanuel said on Nov. 3, 2015. &quot;The idea that some of these co-ops are going to work and some aren&rsquo;t should be expected. That&#39;s what business is about. The idea that 100 percent will succeed is a false metric we don&#39;t hold the private sector to.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to dig into Emanuel&rsquo;s notion that a 50-percent failure rate after five years for businesses applies to these insurance co-ops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where the co-ops came from</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, it included $6 billion in loans to launch<a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Grants/new-loan-program.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> Consumer Owned and Oriented Plans</u></a>. The vision was to create nonprofit health insurance companies that would provide low-cost, high quality policies to individuals and small businesses. Without the need to produce a return on investment, these enterprises would, in theory, be able to compete against the major generally for-profit players in the market. In fact, in places where competition was scant, these co-ops would help the market deliver better value for all consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout 2012 and 2013, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department approved loans to get the co-ops up and running. After a series of budget cuts, program funding was capped at $2.4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, the co-ops began selling policies to provide coverage in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dates are important because it&rsquo;s doubtful any of these co-ops were five years old as of 2015. If they weren&rsquo;t five years old, then Emanuel&rsquo;s benchmark might not be as suitable as he suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emanuel told us that the co-ops launched before 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Many of these co-ops were started in 2011 and were doing a lot of work to get ready,&quot; Emanuel told PunditFact. &quot;To apply for a loan, you had to do some serious analysis about the market and costs. You needed to have a business plan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Emanuel said there isn&rsquo;t any perfect comparison data to work with. His real point he said was &quot;to give some context for the closures,&quot; and &quot;to focus on when they began is to miss the forest for the trees.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Their age? They were somewhere north of three years old,&quot; he told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Harrington is a business professor who focuses on health care finance at the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Wharton School. &nbsp;&quot;Some of the co-ops didn&rsquo;t even last two years,&quot; Harrington said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at the data to help resolve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Failures accumulate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For several decades, the U.S. Census Bureau has tracked the births and deaths of firms in the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/data_firm.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Business Dynamics Statistics</u></a> database. We crunched the numbers in two ways -- for all firms and for firms in the finance, insurance and real estate business. That industry group -- known by the acronym FIRE -- is broader than you would want but it&rsquo;s the closest match to see how the insurance co-ops stack up against approximately similar kinds of firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line is that after five years, about 44 percent of all businesses have disappeared. So Emanuel was pretty close when he said about half have closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as you might expect, the younger the companies, the lower the failure rate. Here&nbsp;are the average rates from 2000 to 2007, based on Census business data. (We didn&rsquo;t include 2008 or 2009 because closings spiked during the Great Recession.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"6\" style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Average firm failure rate 2000-2007</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>After 1 year</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>After 2 years</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>After 3 years</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>After 4 years</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>After 5 years</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>All firms</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">17%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">27%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">34%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">40%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">44%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>FIRE industry</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">16%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">26%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">34%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">40%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">45%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Emanuel&rsquo;s comparison ultimately boils down to how old the co-ops were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no perfect answer. Emanuel said they existed when they began doing the research to apply for a federal loan. You could say they were born on the day Washington approved their loans. We used the Census Bureau definition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau said it treats <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/methodology.html#footnote1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the first year a company shows employment in its payroll tax records</u></a> as the year it was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at CoOportunity Health in Iowa. It was in the first wave of loan recipients on Feb. 17, 2012. The company&rsquo;s former Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ringless told us the loan award took the co-op to the next step of securing a state insurance license. When that came through, it hired a few consultants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When the company was able to develop a payroll system in early June&nbsp;2012, those consultants became full-time employees,&quot; Ringless said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost exactly two-and-half years later, on Jan. 29, 2015, the Iowa insurance commissioner moved to <a href=\"http://www.iid.state.ia.us/node/10089366\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>liquidate CoOportunity Health</u></a>. The firm was about $50 million in the red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some employees were retained as the firm was wound down, as a going concern, its days ended in early 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did not dig into the details of all of the failed co-ops but the CoOportunity timeline seems more or less to apply to many of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-12-00290.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>June 2013 Inspector General&rsquo;s Office</u></a> report looked at the 18 co-ops funded in the first half of 2012. The federal auditors said that by the end of 2012, all of the firms were still &quot;hiring staff, obtaining licensure, and building necessary infrastructure.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the third quarter of 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 12 co-ops would no longer be in business as of 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all this, it would be reasonable to say the co-ops were three years old when they failed. That would run from mid-way through 2012 -- approximately the time of funding -- until mid-way through 2015 -- approximately the time the closure process was underway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The failure rate was over 50 percent. The corresponding failure rate at the three-year mark for all American businesses and for the broader finance, insurance and real estate sector is 34 percent. The co-ops fared significantly worse than the U.S. average, failing at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than is typical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harrington at the University of Pennsylvania noted one other significant difference between the co-ops and the typical American start-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How many firms launch with&nbsp;heavy subsidies from the government?&quot; he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emanuel said the Obamacare insurance co-ops failed at a rate that&rsquo;s typical for American businesses over a five-year period. The underlying comparison is flawed. While the age of each co-op is subject to debate, we used the Census Bureau&rsquo;s definition to determine when they were born. Interviews with experts, government audits, and regulators&rsquo; actions point to three years as the typical lifespan of a failed co-op.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 50 percent of the co-ops shut down. Compared to the three-year failure rate in America, the co-ops have done much worse -- cratering at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than average. But Emanuel could turn out to be right. We won&rsquo;t know the five-year rate for the entire group until late in 2016 or early 2017. If the remaining co-ops are still running, then the group&rsquo;s failure rate will be close to the national average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emanuel&rsquo;s statement is accurate regarding the five-year-average but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-09T15:51:38.550502", "ruling_date": "2015-11-10T17:54:45", "ruling_headline": "Did the Obamacare insurance co-ops fail faster than average?
