David Cicilline&rsquo;s past votes in the state legislature and his work as a criminal defense lawyer to portray the Democrat as someone unwilling to stand up for the victimized.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of those charges, made in an Oct. 9 news release, was that, as a state representative in the 1990s, Cicilline was against mandatory sentences for those convicted of domestic violence and child abuse. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe charge was part of a flurry of political counterpunches Doherty unloaded against Cicilline after the Democratic incumbent linked Republican Doherty to what the Democrats are saying is the Republican Party&rsquo;s &quot;war on women.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty&rsquo;s campaign claimed it was hypocritical for Cicilline to make such a charge when he cast votes as a state representative that indicated a lack of support for victims of domestic violence or child abuse.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Doherty campaign backed up the charge with citations. In 1995, as a state representative from Providence, Cicilline was one of seven House members to vote against a bill that set mandatory minimum sentences for those who were convicted of domestic violence a second time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1996, they said Cicilline also voted against a law that established a 10-year minimum sentence for first-degree child abuse of a child under six. Those sentenced also had to serve at least eight and a half &nbsp;years before being eligible for parole.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked the official record and confirmed that Cicilline voted against both bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 1995 law on domestic violence set a 10-day minimum sentence for a second conviction of misdemeanor domestic assault. The mandatory minimum went up to a year for a third conviction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt also required anyone sentenced under the law to pay a $25 fee to a state fund that paid for state programs on domestic violence training. It also obligated those sentenced to seek counseling. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill passed the House 83-7 and was signed into law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second vote came on a bill that had become known as Brendan&rsquo;s Law. It was proposed in response to the public outrage over the case of six-week old Brendan Cunha, &nbsp;who was left blind, deaf and brain-damaged after a brutal beating by his father, Michael Bertrand, in 1993.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBertrand was given a 10-year prison sentence and 10 years of probation, which meant he was eligible for parole after two years. &nbsp;In 1998, however, the Parole Board not only denied his request, it voted never to consider a request from him again and ordered he serve the full 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the 1996 debate on the bill, Cicilline proposed an amendment that would have allowed a judge to consider an alternative to the 10-year minimum if the judge found &quot;that substantial and compelling circumstances exist&quot; to justify such an action.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe amendment failed on a 60-18 vote and the final bill passed, 77-6, with Cicilline in the minority.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCicilline campaign spokesman Eric Hyers said Cicilline&rsquo;s votes were based on his longstanding belief that judges in the courtroom, who have heard the evidence and arguments in a case, are more qualified to determine appropriate sentences.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He strongly believes that judges, not politicians, not elected officials -- should be making sentencing decisions,&quot; Hyers said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrendan Doherty&rsquo;s campaign said David Cicilline voted against a 1995 bill that imposed harsher sentences on those convicted a second time of domestic violence and a 1996 bill that did the same for convicted child abusers. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislative record shows Cicilline did vote against both bills.
