Rick Scott. It cited information from an anonymous source at the sheriff&rsquo;s office. The story was written by Laura Loomer, a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/may/18/whats-true-whats-not-about-santa-fe-texas-school-s/\">conservative activist</a> we have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/29/blog-posting/loomer-maxine-waters-not-facing-criminal-charges/\">written about before</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed Loomer and did not get a reply.

We didn&rsquo;t get a response from Israel&rsquo;s media relations staff at the sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that Scott was going to suspend Israel has not been reported by other credible news outlets. We asked Scott&rsquo;s office if he plans to suspend Israel, and a spokeswoman said that he will review the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation once it is complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott ordered that investigation into the law enforcement response in February following the Valentine&rsquo;s Day shooting. Israel has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2018/mar/09/fact-checking-broward-sheriff-scott-israels-fact-c/\">faced scrutiny</a> for his office&rsquo;s response to the shooting, including the fact that the school resource officer, Scot Peterson,&nbsp;took position outside of the school rather than go in and engage the shooter. The department is months away from finalizing its investigation and then will submit it to the Broward state attorney for review, an FDLE spokeswoman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor has the <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3\">power to suspend public officials </a>for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony. Scott has <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/02/26/uncharted-territory-could-rick-scott-suspend-the-broward-sheriff/\">largely suspended public officials</a> who have been accused of crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Scott removes Israel, a Democrat, he could appoint a replacement in the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/may/03/broward-democratic-executive-committee/was-broward-one-three-counties-pivotal-obama/\">Democratic-majority county</a>.
