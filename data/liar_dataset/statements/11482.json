Terry McAuliffe wants a reluctant General Assembly to expand Virginia&rsquo;s background check to all prospective gun buyers. His call came in the wake of the Aug. 26 fatal shootings near Smith Mountain Lake of WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct a computerized check to determine whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales and transfers between individuals are exempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Norment was right in saying only 2 percent of Virginia sales fall into that exempt category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, told us Norment erred. &quot;As best we can determine, there are no state-by-state statistics available for the source of a firearm used in a crime,&quot; Ryer wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryer is correct. Neither the Virginia State Police nor the Virginia Firearms Transaction Center &quot;has any way of tracking the volume of private sales in Virginia,&quot; said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also should note that there are no conclusive national statistics about the percentage of guns that are sold without a background check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many gun control advocates - including <a href=\"https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=13032\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>McAuliffe</u></a> and U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/apr/28/tim-kaine/kaine-says-40-percent-guns-sales-estimated-escape-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Tim Kaine</u></a>, D-Va. - have said it&rsquo;s &quot;estimated&quot; that 40 percent of U.S. gun sales occur without background checks. But this claim is based on a small-sample survey of purchasers that&rsquo;s almost 21 years old and counts some guns that were brought before a national background check law took effect. As we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/apr/28/tim-kaine/kaine-says-40-percent-guns-sales-estimated-escape-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reported</u></a>, even the researchers of that study say they &quot;don&rsquo;t know&quot; if their findings are relevant today. There&rsquo;s been no updated national study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note: The killer of Parker and Ward bought his gun legally and passed a background check, according to law-enforcement officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norment said &quot;only about 2 percent&quot; of gun sales in Virginia are not subject to background checks. A spokesman says Norment erred, and we agree. No one knows how many guns are sold privately in Virginia or nationwide these days.
