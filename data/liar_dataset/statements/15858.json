Recently, we&rsquo;ve fact-checked claims <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/10/only-politics/fake-story-says-malia-obama-suspended-harvard/\">that Malia was suspended</a> from Harvard and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/04/blog-posting/no-sasha-obama-wasnt-expelled-racism/\">that Sasha was expelled</a> from school.

That Pants on Fire post claimed Malia was arrested for drinking, drugs and dog-fighting. At the time, Malia was edited into a collection of mugshots from <a href=\"http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/23678692/fcso-arrest-8-in-connection-to-alleged-dog-fighting-ring\">an actual dog-fighting incident in South Carolina in 2013</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cropped version of that altered image appears with the new false claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence of the existence of a &quot;notorious&quot; drug dealer Christopher Turk mentioned in the story. A doctor named Christopher Turk is, however, a main character on the sitcom Scrubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malia is currently attending Harvard University, and Sasha is a senior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington. Neither has been suspended or expelled, and neither has been charged with cocaine possession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-09-13T12:55:22.080180", "ruling_date": "2018-09-14T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hoax wrongly claims Malia Obama arrested for cocaine", "ruling_headline_slug": "hoax-wrongly-claims-malia-obama-arrested-cocaine", "ruling_link_text": "It\u2019s a nope on dope charge", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>TheAmericanNews.co, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theamericanews.co/breaking-malia-obama-just-got-arrested-buying-cocaine/\">BREAKING: &quot;Malia Obama just got arrested buying cocaine,</a>&quot; Sept. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheLastLineOfDefense.org, &quot;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170511144829/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-malia-obama-arrested-with-a-gang-of-thugs-in-chicago/\">BREAKING: Malia Obama Arrested With A Gang Of Thugs In Chicago</a>,&quot; May 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/10/only-politics/fake-story-says-malia-obama-suspended-harvard/\">Fake story says Malia Obama suspended from Harvard</a>,&quot; April 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/04/blog-posting/no-sasha-obama-wasnt-expelled-racism/\">No, Sasha Obama wasn&rsquo;t expelled for racism</a>,&quot; Sept. 4, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/may/08/blog-posting/time-fake-news-says-malia-obama-arrested-drugs-dog/\">This time fake news says Malia Obama arrested for drugs, dog fighting in Chicago</a>,&quot; May 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMDb, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285403/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1\">Scrubs</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 13, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WMBF News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/23678692/fcso-arrest-8-in-connection-to-alleged-dog-fighting-ring\">FCSO arrest 8 in connection to alleged dog fighting ring</a>&quot; Oct. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Insider, &quot;&#39;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-children-of-presidents-went-to-school-2017-6\">First kid&#39; Barron Trump is heading to a $40,000 private school in Maryland &mdash; here&#39;s where the other first kids went to school</a>,&quot; July 14, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Malia Obama just got arrested buying cocaine&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a blog post", "statement_date": "2018-09-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
