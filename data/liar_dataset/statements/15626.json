That too is false.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only is there no mention of it in any remotely reliable news source (we checked on the Lexis-Nexis news database), but Eastwood just started a new film that he will both direct and act in called Mule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shooting begins in the second half of July in Las Cruces, N.M.
