Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to cut down on fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post appeared after Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/sheriff-joe-arpaio-donald-trump-pardon/index.html\">Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio</a>, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge&rsquo;s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kentucky-clerk-kim-davis-released-from-jail/\">sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court</a> for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks&rsquo; names off marriage licenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/03/526615385/gay-couples-lawsuit-against-kentucky-clerk-is-back-on-after-appeals-court-ruling\">suits had been dismissed</a>. The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/article162885388.html\">paying $225,000 in legal fees</a> for the couple that brought the suit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Davis can&rsquo;t get a pardon, because technically she wasn&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-information-and-instructions\">convicted of a federal crime</a>.
