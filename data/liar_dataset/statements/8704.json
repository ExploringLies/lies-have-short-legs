We had a big debate about this, President (Barack) Obama discussed this. President Obama is a constitutional law professor, he came into office very concerned about the terrible ...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC political analyst Matthew Dowd jumped in as Kristol spoke to say Obama&rsquo;s performance in this area is &quot;exceedingly disappointing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry, then he became president of the United States,&quot; Kristol replied. &quot;He got all the briefings, he saw seriously what was going on, and basically he decided, I think, correctly, that you know what, the balance is probably pretty appropriately struck. Now he&rsquo;s shifting ... entirely because of optics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact wanted to know if Kristol is correct about Obama&rsquo;s evolution on government spying programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obama in the Senate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his early years in the Senate, Obama was a reliable critic of the post-Sept. 11 surveillance efforts launched by President George W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bush+warrant+wiretap&amp;st=nyt\"><u>New York Times</u></a> </em>exposed a Bush executive order allowing the National Security Agency to tap Americans&rsquo; international phone calls and emails in effort to track terrorists without seeking search warrants from the courts. The <em>Times </em>reported the agency was still seeking warrants for monitoring domestic communications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Senate voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act that same week, Obama decried the administration&rsquo;s &quot;fishing expedition&quot; of Americans&rsquo; everyday electronic records<strong> </strong>in a <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/the-cycle/obamas-08-pledge-us-must-respect-americans\"><u>floor speech</u></a>: &quot;This is just plain wrong. ... Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing &ndash; and it&rsquo;s the right thing &ndash; but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2006 speech explaining why he would vote against confirming Michael Hayden as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2006, Obama said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&rsquo;t expect the president to give the American people every detail about a classified surveillance program. But we do expect him to place such a program within the rule of law, and to allow members of the other two co-equal branches of government &mdash; Congress and the Judiciary &mdash; to have the ability to monitor and oversee such a program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And: &quot;We need to find a way forward to make sure that we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy, and liberty, of innocent Americans. As a nation we have to find the right balance between privacy and security, between executive authority to face threats and uncontrolled power. What protects us, and what distinguishes us, are the procedures we put in place to protect that balance, namely judicial warrants and congressional review. ... These are concrete safeguards to make sure surveillance hasn&rsquo;t gone too far.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obama as a candidate for president</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward to 2007. Obama is running for president -- and still criticizing Bush for operating without enough oversight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said the Bush administration &quot;puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we provide.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <em>Des Moines Register</em> (via <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/350536/president-obama-privacy-and-civil-liberties-retrospective-lindsey-grudnicki\"><u>National Review Online</u></a>)<strong>, </strong>he said, &quot;When I am president, there will be no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next year, however, he faced charges of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/john-mccain/what-a-difference-eight-months-makes/\"><u>flip-flopping</u> on warrantless wiretapping</a>&nbsp;by his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At issue was legislation in 2008 that rewrote the rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that lays out rules for spying in the country and created a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-foreign-intelligence-surveillanc/\"><u>secret court of judges to oversee</u></a> it. Congress amended the law amid backlash. One of the most controversial questions was whether to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that had turned over network data to the government, as the companies were vulnerable to lawsuits following the <em>Times</em> expos&eacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama&rsquo;s campaign said he would oppose a bill that provided retroactive immunity for the companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But<strong> </strong>he ended up joining 68 senators who voted for it, disappointing some on the left as well as advocates of civil liberties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes to FISA in 2008 essentially legalized warrantless wiretapping that had been going on, Molly Bishop Shadel, an expert in foreign intelligence law at the University of Virginia School of Law, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/05/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-congresss-shock-spying-allies-rings-ho/\"><u>previously told PunditFact</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Congress expanded the scope of FISA even though it knew or should have known that the NSA had done something questionable,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama defended his vote to supporters by saying the new law includes checks and balances that weren&rsquo;t in place before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Senator Obama has said before that the compromise bill is not perfect,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/09/ST2008070902472.html\"><u>his campaign said</u></a> in a statement at the time. &quot;Given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill, and losing important surveillance tools, Senator Obama chose to support the FISA compromise.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama explained the bill &quot;is far better than the Protect America Act that I voted against last year... (because it) makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/john-mccain/what-a-difference-eight-months-makes/\"><u>PolitiFact rated McCain&rsquo;s claim</u></a> that Obama flip-flopped after promising to filibuster a bill that provided retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies as True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obama as president</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No substantial legislative oversight has been added to the Patriot Act since Obama took over the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama signed a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act in December 2012. The Senate rejected amendments that would have required intelligence agencies to report more information about their work to Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Snowden&rsquo;s revelations, Obama defended two surveillance programs using some of the language Kristol mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You can&#39;t have 100 percent security and also have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience.

Most notably, he voted for a bill that essentially approved warrantless wiretapping in July 2008.
