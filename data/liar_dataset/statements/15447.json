Hypocrisy on the Left is sickening! Your (sic) pathetic!&quot; user JamieR tweeted. Barr has since deleted her retweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The image is doctored. In the original photograph, taken at the Women&rsquo;s March in New York on Jan. 21, 2017, Goldberg wore a shirt that read, &quot;And you thought I was a nasty woman before? Buckle up, buttercup.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldberg <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdtOz-VFpPU\">showed</a> the original shirt she wore using video footage on <em>The View</em> on April 18, 2017, when the image first surfaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I need to clear up a lie that was posted online this morning,&quot; Goldberg said. &quot;A photo of me at the Women&rsquo;s March has been photoshopped to show me wearing an offensive shirt against you-know-who. Even though I don&rsquo;t care for this man, I would never wear this shirt that&rsquo;s there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That didn&rsquo;t stop social media users from circulating the image again in May 2017, when comedian Kathy Griffin landed in hot water after posing for photographs with a mock severed head of Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldberg <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hbm0XspKIU\">explained</a> the photo again when it resurfaced on May 30, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now, some bonehead photoshopped a horrific image on the shirt,&quot; Goldberg said. &quot;And (Barr) retweeted this. So this is what I&rsquo;m going to say, Roseanne. Just because you were caught with your pants down, don&rsquo;t try to drag other people down with you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The picture was doctored.
