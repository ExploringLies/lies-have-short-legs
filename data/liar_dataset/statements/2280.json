Kendrick Meek has dispatched billionaire U.S. Senate Democratic rival Jeff Greene, Meek is quickly pivoting to a general election campaign where he will face Republican Marco Rubio and a former Republican, Gov. Charlie Crist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means Meek will do everything he can between now and Nov. 2, 2010, to distinguish himself from his two opponents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt his Aug. 24, 2010, primary victory speech at the Westin Diplomat in Hollywood, Meek labeled his two major fall opponents conservative. He repeated a claim that PolitiFact Florida ruled <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/may/26/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meeks-position-offshore-oil-drilling-rema/\">Mostly True</a>, that he is the only candidate who has consistently opposed additional offshore oil drilling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd he also talked about the 2009 Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I will be the only candidate, ladies and gentlemen, that stood in there with Justice Sotomayor,&quot; said Meek, surrounded by his family and supporters. &quot;When she was up for her nomination, I stood up and said she was the right selection and she will make an excellent Supreme Court justice.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis fact check is pretty straightforward: Does the record support Meek&#39;s claim?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court on May 26, 2009. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Aug. 6, 2009. Here&#39;s what the three major candidates said about Sotomayor that summer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Kendrick Meek -- </b>Meek joined Puerto Rican leaders in Miami on June 1 to support Sotomayor&#39;s nomination to the country&#39;s highest court. On June 2, he attended a similar event in Orlando. &quot;She is an outstanding candidate for the Supreme Court,&quot; Meek said in Orlando. There is no record of him wavering from that position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Marco Rubio</b> -- Rubio, meanwhile, is on record opposing the Sotomayor nomination. He wrote an Aug. 5 column published by <em>Politico </em>titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/25788.html\" id=\"y_h-\" title=\"Opposing the philosophy of Sonia Sotomayor isn't anti-Hispanic\">Opposing the philosophy of Sonia Sotomayor isn&#39;t anti-Hispanic</a>.&quot; Rubio wrote: &quot;During the recent Judiciary Committee hearings, it became clear that I could not in good conscience support Sotomayor&#39;s confirmation and would vote against it if I were in the Senate today ... As a whole, Sotomayor&#39;s record reflects a view that judges can and should inject personal experiences and biases into what should be the objective interpretation and application of the law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Charlie Crist -- </b>On July 21, <a href=\"http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/dcblog/2009/07/charlie_crist_i_cant_support_s.html\" id=\"h0al\" title=\"Crist also came out against\">Crist also came out against</a> Sotomayor&#39;s confirmation. At that point, Crist was still a Republican. &quot;While I have not had the opportunity to meet personally with Judge Sotomayor -- a crucial step in the selection process -- I have reviewed and reflected upon her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and come to the conclusion that I cannot support her appointment to the United States Supreme Court,&quot; Crist said. &quot;Judge Sotomayor is worthy of respect for her many accomplishments and her remarkable story of success. However, I have strong concerns that Judge Sotomayor would not strictly and objectively construe the constitution and lacks respect for the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. For these reasons, I cannot support her appointment to the highest court in the land.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a May 2010 interview with the <i>Miami Herald</i>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2010/05/crist-cant-recall-why-he-opposed-sotomayor.html\" id=\"yqj:\" title=\"no party candidate Crist continued to say\">no-party candidate Crist continued to say</a> that he would have opposed Sotomayor over questions about the Second Amendment, though he could not recall specifically what those questions were.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe fall ballot will include more names than just Meek, Rubio and Crist. But we couldn&#39;t find statements on Sotomayor from any of the minor or no-party candidates. None of those candidates has received more than 5 percent in any recent statewide poll.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his primary victory speech, Meek said that he is the only candidate who publicly supported Sonia Sotomayor&#39;s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Compared to Crist and Rubio, the two other major candidates, Meek is right.
