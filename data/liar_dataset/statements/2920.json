Bobby Scott has taken the unpopular position of not only opposing the extensions for the wealthy, but for everyone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott says allowing all cuts to expire would pare the deficit -- something he says the Republicans have been unwilling to do.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Fiscal responsibility in the federal budget requires making tough choices,&quot; Scott wrote in a recent release. &quot;For the six years that the Republican Party held both chambers in Congress and the White House, they failed time and time again to make these tough choices. They enacted $1.3 trillion in tax cuts in 2001 and another $300 billion in 2003 without offsets. They created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a smorgasbord of claims ripe for the checking, but we thought we&rsquo;d look into the latter claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott&rsquo;s office did not respond to a request for the source of the claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a definition: The Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 -- better known as the Medicare Modernization Act -- created a new benefit called Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGauging its price is tricky. How do you measure the cost of something that will continue to accumulate over the years and and has no end date?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrian Riedl, a federal budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, gave us a hint.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Most people talk about costs in a 10-year period,&quot; he said. &quot;When the Congressional Budget Office scores a bill, they often will score the 10-year costs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK, so we&rsquo;ll look at the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4808/11-20-MedicareLetter.pdf\">CBO&rsquo;s</a> Nov. 20, 2003 cost analysis of the program over its first decade, 2004 through 2013. It&rsquo;s just shy of $400 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a long way from Scott&rsquo;s $1 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about a more recent estimate?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/33_1.pdf\">fiscal 2011 analysis from the Office of Management and Budget</a>, the cost of the program from 2011 to 2020 would be more than $950 billion, close enough to $1 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that a fair measure?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, better than the $400 billion from 2004-2013, says Riedl, noting that the program wasn&rsquo;t fully implemented until 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he added that Scott could have been more clear in what period of time he measuring.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I know as a budget geek what people mean, but I think a regular layman may think he means a trillion dollars a year,&quot; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut here&rsquo;s the other thing Scott leaves out -- Democrats, led by Ted Kennedy, had pitched an even more expensive Medicare Part D plan scored by the CBO to cost $800 billion in its first 10 years, double the cost of the Republican plan. (Scott voted against the Republican plan when it came to the House floor.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith a big budget surplus in 2000, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore pledged on the campaign trail to add prescription drugs to Medicare coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No one ever talked about how to pay for it,&quot; Riedl said. &quot;There was never any serious discussion on any side of offsets because at the time, that&rsquo;s when we were supposed to have a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added: &quot;Then the budget collapsed and now we&rsquo;re in deep doo doo.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo review:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott says Republicans created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe true cost of the program is unknown since it will continue to grow. In fact, the Government Accountability Office shows that the cost could exceed $7 trillion in 75 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf we use a 10-year cost measure, Scott would be wrong looking over the first decade of the program, which is estimated to cost shy of $500 billion. &nbsp;But if we look at the cost over the next 10 years, Scott is close to correct based on current projections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we find the claim to be Mostly True.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-06T19:38:39.526457", "ruling_date": "2010-12-07T10:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Bobby Scott says Republicans created $1 trillion prescription drug plan", "ruling_headline_slug": "bobby-scott-says-republicans-created-1-trillion-pr", "ruling_link_text": "He's close on the cost for the next decade", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert C. &quot;Bobby&quot; Scott statement, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bobbyscott.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=533&amp;Itemid=62\">Ending All Bush-era Tax Cuts Will Bring Budget Near Balance in Four Years</a>,&quot; Nov. 16, 2010. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/48xx/doc4808/11-20-MedicareLetter.pdf\">H.R. 1, Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 cost estimate</a>, Nov. 20, 2003.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOffice of Management and Budget, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/33_1.pdf\">Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2011 </a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Record, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=gjsOK4p-UFIC&amp;pg=PA16449&amp;lpg=PA16449&amp;dq=%24800+billion+Medicare+D+plan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5LT1IjMd29&amp;sig=HpJ9F_DToc24f9sRJmXSjchuDzo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mUT5TPneGYa0lQfb6PzgBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%24800%20billion%20Medicare%20D%20plan&amp;f=false\">U.S. Senate</a>, June 30, 2003<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=These+statements+present+the+net+cost+of+fiscal+years+2009+and+2008+Government1+operations%2C+including+the&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1\">2009 Financial Report</a>, accessed Dec. 3, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Brian Riedl, Grover Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs<br />\r\n\tThe Heritage Foundation, Dec. 3, 2010&nbsp;</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "U.S. Congressman", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Bobby ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 825, "last_name": "Scott", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "bobby-scott", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/SCOTt.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/825/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://bobbyscottforcongress.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tRepublicans &quot;created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>", "statement_context": "", "statement_date": "2010-11-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
