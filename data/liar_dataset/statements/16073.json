Andy Barr of doing just that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican is running for re-election in Kentucky&rsquo;s 6th Congressional District against Marine veteran Amy McGrath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DCCC launched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAU38PRe5I4&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">the ad</a> &quot;Doing Right&quot; on Oct. 8, and it accuses Barr of brushing off the significance of military service. The ad ran from Oct. 9 to Oct. 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After criticizing Barr for allegedly giving tax breaks to corporations, the ad says Barr was &quot;even dismissing&nbsp;the importance of military service&quot; while onscreen text displays a quote from him that reads: &quot;We both served our country. I&rsquo;ve served in a position where ideas matter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So did Barr actually dismiss military service when compared&nbsp;with serving in political office? Not exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What Barr said in context</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The DCCC&rsquo;s ad cites an <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/16/andy-barr-compares-politics-amy-mcgraths-military-service/1008170002/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> from the<em> </em>Louisville Courier Journal, which references an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/us/politics/amy-mcgrath-andy-barr.html\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> Barr gave to the New York Times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one point, Barr seems to compare his political experience in government with McGrath&rsquo;s military service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DCCC ad ends his quote with Barr saying that he&rsquo;s &quot;served in a position where ideas matter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, it isn&rsquo;t the complete quote: &quot;We both served our country. I&rsquo;ve served in a position where ideas matter. My opponent has served her country in the military, where execution matters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad stops short of finishing Barr&rsquo;s quote and makes it look like he said something more damning &ndash; that political office experience is more important than serving in the military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barr didn&rsquo;t say that, but he did compare the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Barr campaign says that the charge is a lie and pointed to his work on behalf of veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A member of Congress serves his / her constituents,&quot; spokeswoman Jodi Whitaker said. &quot;They get people their Social Security checks, Medicare payments, veteran benefits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A DCCC ad says Barr is belittling military service while emphasizing the role of holding political office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barr did compare military service with being a politician.
