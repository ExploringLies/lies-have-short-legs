And according to NBC&rsquo;s Andrea Mitchell, the notion that Snipes is trying to engineer a victory for Democrats is even more off-base because, as Mitchell claimed, Snipes is a <em>Republican</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We should also point out that Brenda Snipes in Broward County is a Republican appointed by former governor, then-Gov. Jeb Bush,&quot; Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSTZnOWmi5M\">said</a> Nov. 12. &quot;So she was put in by a Republican governor after the mess that we all remember from 2000. And she&rsquo;s hardly a Democratic official, or someone doing the bidding of the Democratic candidates there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitchell is wrong about Snipes&rsquo; party affiliation: She&rsquo;s a Democrat. But, again, it&rsquo;s important to note we&rsquo;ve seen no evidence Snipes has done anything untoward on her party&rsquo;s behalf during the Florida recount.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Snipes: &lsquo;I have been a Democrat all my life&rsquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitchell is apparently not the only person confused about Snipes&rsquo; political affiliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/11/14/cnns_chris_cuomo_interviews_brenda_snipes_i_have_not_made_any_decisions_about_political_future.html\">interview with CNN</a>, Snipes said she recently corrected someone who mistakenly believed she was a Republican:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&quot;I was talking with a woman today, as she came into our office, and she made some statement &mdash; a partisan statement &mdash; and she said, &lsquo;I know that you&rsquo;re a Republican.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have been a Democrat all my life.&rsquo; In this position, I have been very focused on party, because I want to treat all of the voters in Broward County the same. And I think if you&rsquo;d ask the voters, I have that reputation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At look at Snipes&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.browardsoe.org/Elected-Officials\">biography</a> on the Broward County supervisor of elections website also lists her as a Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/N-GyuuI5cIi9dxvi9URWYvt0F6HOvw9OlEw46YIf6wcfwtEGo5Eg4Xh1JMqyCR1NBbGH0-w4_th0VydJOZ_ot3_L28HGAh7ntI9CtgapKHjaIWx0RMx7y864vTLfLu9ERlTzLZ-Z\" style=\"height:465px; width:470px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countless media reports also refer to Snipes&rsquo; Democratic affiliation. To take just one example, here&rsquo;s an article from the South Florida Sun Sentinel about Snipes&rsquo; 2016 re-election bid, which references her party affiliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Snipes, a Democrat, was appointed by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2003, after he removed her predecessor Miriam Oliphant,&quot; the 2015 article <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-snipes-election-account-20150922-story.html\">reads</a>. &quot;Snipes went on to win three elections.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snipes went on to win the 2016 Democratic primary by a whopping <a href=\"https://enr.electionsfl.org/BRO/1546/Summary/\">53 percentage points</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact also referenced Snipes&rsquo; Democratic affiliation in <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/oct/31/roger-stone/no-roger-stone-hillary-clinton-did-not-meet-browar/\">a fact-check</a> we wrote during the 2016 presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to reach Mitchell through a press contact for her NBC show but did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitchell said Snipes is a Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s wrong.
