Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, has introduced a bill that would require students to show their privates before using a restroom in a public school in Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Virginia Republican wants schools to check children&rsquo;s genitals before using bathroom,&quot; read the headline of a Jan. 12 web <a href=\"http://www.occupydemocrats.com/virginia-republican-wants-schools-to-check-childrens-genitals-before-using-bathroom/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>post</u></a> by Occupy Democrats, a group started in 2012 to - in its own words - &quot;counterbalance the Republican Tea Party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ensuing article elaborated that Cole&rsquo;s bill &quot;would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their &lsquo;anatomical sex.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar claims have been posted on the websites of at least two other liberal groups: <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/01/virginia-gop-bill-would-require-schools-to-verify-childrens-genitals-before-using-restroom/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Raw Story</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.peacock-panache.com/2016/01/va-gop-bill-would-require-inspection-of-childrens-genitals-21253.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Peacock Panache</u></a>, triggering some Internet debate that isn&rsquo;t exactly flattering to Cole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether the description of Cole&rsquo;s bill is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School bathrooms have been a scalding issue in Cole&rsquo;s district, where some parents have objected to a transgender student&rsquo;s use of a girls&rsquo; lavatory at a Stafford County elementary school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officials at the school initially allowed the student to use the girls&rsquo; room. But amid an outcry from some parents, the school board reversed that policy and instead directed the student to use a single-stall lavatory at the school, a staff bathroom, or the boys&rsquo; restroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?ses=161&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb663\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Cole&rsquo;s bill</u></a> would direct school boards across the state to develop policies to ensure that any public school restroom and locker room &quot;designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation.&quot; The legislation defines &quot;anatomical sex&quot; as the &quot;physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person&rsquo;s anatomy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That measure, introduced Jan. 11, does not spell out exactly how school officials would verify a student&rsquo;s gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colin Taylor, the managing editor of Occupy Democrats, and Omar Rivero, the group&rsquo;s founder, told us in an email that the group &quot;simply took Del. Mark Cole&rsquo;s offensive proposal to its logical conclusion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How else would an enforcing official determine whether or not the individual&#39;s anatomical sex matches Del. Cole&#39;s interpretation of binary gender designation?&quot; they wrote. &quot;Are they expecting children or adults to voluntarily turn themselves in? Will they have to submit to inspection by a doctor? <em>Somebody</em> will have to inspect to prove that an individual is or is not anatomically correct.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as our colleagues at the fact-checking website Snopes.com recently <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/mark-cole-controversy/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>noted</u></a>, there&rsquo;s nothing in the bill explicitly calling for a genital inspection before students use the bathroom. There are, of course, other possibilities for verification, such as obtaining a doctor&rsquo;s note, Snopes said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To clarify the matter, Cole introduced a second restroom <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?ses=161&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb781\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>bill</u></a> Jan. 12 that calls for schools to verify a student&rsquo;s &quot;biological sex&quot; by examining their birth certificate. Both his bills would carry a $50 civil fine for each violation by a student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cole issued a <a href=\"http://marklcole.com/MarkColePR12Jan2016.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>written statement</u></a> Jan. 13 accusing critics of mischaracterizing his bill, which he said attempts to provide clear policies on who can and can&rsquo;t use a particular bathroom to shield school divisions from lawsuits. He said he introduced the bill at the request of parents in his district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Contrary to what has been said about the legislation, it does NOT require genital checks,&quot; Cole wrote. He said the legislation would be enforced only when there was a complaint about a student&rsquo;s choice of bathrooms. &quot;If needed, gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate,&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cole told us on Jan. 15 that he will propose an amendment for his bill that will make it crystal clear it does not allow genital inspections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would be, I think, blatantly unconstitutional for someone to conduct such a search,&quot; Cole said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occupy Democrats said Cole &quot;wants schools to check children&rsquo;s genitals before using bathroom.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is nothing in Cole&rsquo;s bill that says students will be forced to show their private parts to school officials before they can use the restroom. The group defends its statement by saying &quot;it&rsquo;s the logical conclusion&quot; of legislation that&rsquo;s silent on how it would be enforced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are other possibilities the group doesn&rsquo;t consider. Cole suggests using birth certificates and student records to verify a student&rsquo;s anatomical gender. The loose writing of the bill, which Cole is trying to tighten, leaves the legislator a little bit open to criticism. But it doesn&rsquo;t entitle Occupy Democrats to make up a genital inspection claim and attach Cole&rsquo;s name to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the group&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-17T22:22:15.303063", "ruling_date": "2016-01-18T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Occupy Democrats grossly twists Virginia school bathroom bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "occupy-democrats-grossly-twists-virginia-school-ba", "ruling_link_text": "Doesn't wash", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Occupy Democrats, <a href=\"http://www.occupydemocrats.com/virginia-republican-wants-schools-to-check-childrens-genitals-before-using-bathroom/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Virginia Republican wants schools to check children&rsquo;s genitals before using bathroom,&quot;</u></a> Jan. 12, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Occupy Democrats, Jan. 14, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Del.
