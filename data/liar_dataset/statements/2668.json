There aren&rsquo;t any serious political contenders in Oregon who fit the bill, anyway.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that hasn&rsquo;t stopped the Oregon House Democrats from trying to tie one local candidate to Sarah Palin and her &quot;rogue&quot; ways.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a recent Democratic mailer, Future PAC proudly proclaims that &quot;Oregon isn&rsquo;t grizzly country.&quot;<br />\r\n\tOn the reverse it says that Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate for House District 37, is &quot;one of Sarah Palin&rsquo;s mama grizzlies.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Recently,&quot; it goes on, &quot;Julie Parrish received national attention after she was singled out by Fox News as one of Sarah Palin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mama Grizzlies.&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We don&rsquo;t really want one of Sarah Palin&rsquo;s Mama Grizzlies making decisions for us, do we?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Don&rsquo;t think so. Support a Grizzly-Free West Linn and Tualatin.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, PolitiFact Oregon decided we ought to vet all of the above charges, and set to work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst up: Is Oregon &quot;grizzly country&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat all depends. If House Democrats are talking about the actual bear (we imagine they might be, as there is a fancy, cut-out image of a bear on the mailer), then they&rsquo;re right. No grizzlies have been spotted in Oregon since the early 1900s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf, however, they&rsquo;re talking about &quot;Grizzly Bear,&quot; the popular indie band, they&rsquo;re way off. The band <a href=\"http://grizzly-bear.net/date/2009/?cat=4\">played in Portland </a>last October, and we have faith the group will return to serenade us yet again. (We recommend a <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/grizzlybear\">quick listen </a>to &quot;The Knife,&quot; our favorite song of theirs.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeriously, we might have to leave the whole &quot;grizzly country&quot; designation alone and move on to the more substantive side of the mailer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs Parrish really one of Palin&rsquo;s mama grizzlies?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo get to the bottom of this pressing political issue, we went to a <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4293258/mama-grizzlies-are-fed-up\">video </a>of Parrish on Fox News and gave it a quick look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe anchor frames the TV spot as follows: &quot;Well, Sarah Palin says they&#39;re like mama grizzlies, a trend of fed-up, conservative moms getting involved in politics. Many for the very first time.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s then some Sarah Palin voiceover and inspiring images. At one point, Palin says &quot;It&#39;s kind of a mom awakening in the last year and a half.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen we&rsquo;re back to the anchor, who says, &quot;And joining us are three first-time candidates and mama grizzlies.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe got in touch with Parrish, who said she was a bit surprised about the way the TV spot unfolded. &quot;The focus was supposed to be moms and politics,&quot; she said. &quot;I was surprised, quite frankly, in how they intro-ed that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, you can find the video on her <a href=\"http://www.julie4oregon.com/news\">website</a>, and she didn&rsquo;t object on the air.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is this video really enough to link her to Sarah Palin? We still, for all of our sleuthing, weren&rsquo;t sure. So we did a little more research and found that Parrish has not received any monetary help from Palin or the out-of-state tea party groups with which the ex-vice presidential candidate is sometimes linked. Neither has Palin come to town to stump for Parrish. Heck, she hasn&rsquo;t even endorsed her, as far we can tell.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does that leave us? The claim suggests that there is a formal connection to Palin or at the minimum some show of support. There&rsquo;s no evidence of that. So we are left with simply one Fox newscaster calling Parrish a &quot;mama grizzly&quot; in that she&rsquo;s a conservative mother in politics for the first time. But her connections to Sarah Palin appear to be non-existent. We rate this claim Bearly -- oops! -- Barely True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/10/politifact_oregon_grizzlies_sa.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
