We decided to check that claim about Steven Chu, and while we&rsquo;re at it -- are Europeans really paying that much to fuel their Fiats?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What Chu said</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nChu is a a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who served as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a federal energy research center. His quote about European gas prices has become somewhat notorious since he uttered it almost four years ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn an interview with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in late 2008 -- before Obama was elected and at a point when Chu had no ties to Obama -- Chu told the newspaper that he favored raising gasoline taxes gradually over 15 years to coax consumers into buying fuel-efficient cars and discouraging sprawl.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,&quot; Chu said in an interview with the <em>Journal </em>in September 2008. The quote did not appear in print until December, when the <a href=\"http://sec.online.wsj.com/article/SB122904040307499791.html\"><em>Journal</em> ran a story</a> after news emerged that Chu was being tapped as energy secretary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has been a target of criticism numerous times since then.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The popularity of Chu&rsquo;s now-infamous quotation tends to track the rise and fall of gas prices: It enjoyed a huge surge of attention last spring and summer (2011) before largely vanishing from view in the fall, leading up to this month&rsquo;s renaissance,&quot; reporter Bob King wrote in a story in <em>POLITICO</em>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs it happens, after Gingrich&#39;s comment, Chu <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73934.html\">backed away from what he said</a>. At a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 13, 2012, Chu said, &quot;Since I walked in the door as secretary of Energy I&rsquo;ve been doing everything in my powers to do what we can to &hellip; reduce those prices.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChu added, according to <em>POLITICO</em>, that the &quot;most important tool in DOE&rsquo;s tool chest is moving off oil.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;So are you saying you no longer share the view that we need to figure out how to boost gasoline prices in America?&quot; Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I no longer share that view,&quot; Chu said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;When I became secretary of Energy, I represented the U.S. government,&quot; Chu added. &quot;Of course we don&rsquo;t want the price of gasoline to go up, we want it to go down.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGetting back to Gingrich&rsquo;s portrayal of Chu&rsquo;s 2008 remark -- that he &quot;has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels&quot; -- Chu&rsquo;s statement was indeed public. He said it to a newspaper. And he did express a desire to raise domestic gas prices closer to those in Europe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About that $10 gas</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGingrich pegged the cost of a gallon of gasoline in Europe at between $9 and $10. We contacted the European Union, which provided <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/energy/observatory/oil/doc/prices/bulletin_with_taxes/2012_03_05_with_taxes_1595.pdf\">this chart</a> showing gasoline prices in various countries as of March 5, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chart (on page 2 of the document) shows prices in Euros per liter. We converted that into dollars per gallon and came up with these figures:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France: $7.07 per gallon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portugal: $7.24 per gallon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy came in highest at $8.48 per gallon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also received information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to the chart on page 3 of <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/stats/surveys/mps.pdf\">this document</a>, which shows prices in January 2012, a gallon of gasoline cost $7.54 per gallon in France, $8.07 in Germany and $6.68 in the United Kingdom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe travel website <a href=\"http://www.mytravelcost.com\">mytravelcost.com</a> reports even higher prices. The site, which says it updates prices monthly, puts a liter of unleaded in France at 1.64 euros. Converted to dollars per gallon, that&rsquo;s $8.10 per gallon. In Spain, it&rsquo;s $7.06 per gallon, and in the Netherlands it&rsquo;s $8.90, according to the website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGingrich said that Chu, the energy secretary, &quot;has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels [for gasoline] and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChu&rsquo;s statement, made to the the<em> Wall Street Journal</em> in 2008, was &quot;somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.&quot; Gingrich&rsquo;s paraphrase was accurate. As for the price, he aimed a little high. We found examples of gasoline near $9 a gallon in Europe, but none approaching $10. Gasoline prices fluctuate, however, and so does the exchange rate between dollars and euros. But, because of the discrepancy, we rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This story originally provided an incorrect date for the Fox News Sunday program on which Gingrich appeared.
