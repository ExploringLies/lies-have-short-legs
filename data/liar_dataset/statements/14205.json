It was flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake as part of the social media website&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post said Snowden told the <em>Moscow Tribune</em> that instead of killing the al-Qaida leader <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/08/getting-bin-laden\">in May 2011</a>, the United States set him up with a cushy retirement fund through the CIA payroll. As of 2013, it said, bin Laden is living with &quot;five of his wives and many children&quot; collecting more than $100,000 a month via a Nassau bank account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA&rsquo;s most efficient operatives for a long time,&quot; Snowden is allegedly quoted as saying. &quot;What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody&rsquo;s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could find no evidence that Snowden, who leaked classified information about the federal government&rsquo;s surveillance programs, has ever said such a thing about bin Laden. Snowden fled to Moscow to avoid espionage charges and has since given several interviews, but this post is fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Versions <a href=\"http://www.revolutions2040.com/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-still-alive-living-bahamas/\">of the story</a> <a href=\"http://reflectionofmind.org/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-alive-well-bahamas/\">have appeared</a> <a href=\"http://awarenessact.com/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-is-still-alive-living-in-the-bahamas/\">on many other</a> <a href=\"http://nation.com.pk/national/23-May-2017/osama-bin-laden-is-still-alive-claims-snowden\">websites over</a> <a href=\"http://postcard.news/shocking-revelations-osama-bin-laden-still-alive-living-bahamas-family/\">the last</a> <a href=\"http://www.heightpost.com/edward-snowden-claims-osama-bin-laden/\">several months</a>.
