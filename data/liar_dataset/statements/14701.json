Republican candidate for governor John Cox has pledged that, if elected, he&rsquo;ll hack through California&rsquo;s thicket of regulations, in an effort to reduce expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, Cox wants to reform the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, an agency he has described as overstaffed and wasteful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, he claimed Caltrans spends an exorbitant amount to build and maintain each mile of roadway compared with other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It costs nearly five times as much in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation,&quot; Cox said in an interview published on the <a href=\"http://politicalvanguard.com/\">Political Vanguard website</a> on Oct. 19, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox made a similar claim in a <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> <a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Repeal-California-s-gas-tax-increase-says-GOP-12288712.php\">op-ed</a> on Oct. 18, 2017:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.&quot; CEI is a libertarian think tank which sourced the statistic to the Reason Foundation, another free market think tank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following both statements, Cox went on to advocate for greater reliance on private construction to reduce expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a debate about why it&rsquo;s so expensive to build roads in California. But we&rsquo;re not fact-checking that debate. Instead, we&rsquo;re zeroing in on Cox&rsquo;s specific claims that California&#39;s road spending is &quot;nearly five times&quot; per mile compared with other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background on John Cox</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his campaign <a href=\"https://johncoxforgovernor.com/about/\">website</a>, Cox describes himself as a &quot;Jack Kemp-style Republican who grew up on Chicago&rsquo;s south-side.&quot; Today, he&rsquo;s a San Diego businessman who &quot;founded an organization that repairs the homes of low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His priorities, as listed on his website, include lowering California&rsquo;s taxes and fighting the influence of special interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox is the chairman of Give Voters a Voice, an effort to repeal California&rsquo;s recent gas tax increase, which was signed into law this year to raise money for road repairs. The increase includes a 12-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase, which went into effect this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Cox&rsquo;s campaign for evidence supporting his claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It pointed to recent reports by the Reason Foundation, which&nbsp;studies transportation spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, the foundation published its <a href=\"http://reason.org/files/20th_annual_highway_report.pdf\">&quot;20th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That report shows California spent nearly $680,000 per mile in 2009 on roadways. That was 4.7 times as much as the national average of approximately $144,000 per mile spent in other states. That matches Cox&rsquo;s claim of &quot;nearly five times&quot; as much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But our research shows, and Cox&rsquo;s campaign has acknowledged, the information from 2009 is outdated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"http://reason.org/files/22nd_annual_highway_report.pdf\">updated 2016 Reason Foundation study</a> shows California spent about $420,000 per mile in 2013 compared with the national average spending of about $160,000 per mile in the same year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That data places California&rsquo;s spending at about 2.5 times the national average, far less than Cox&rsquo;s claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Cox&rsquo;s staff about the discrepancy. David Kersten, a policy analyst with the campaign, said the candidate didn&rsquo;t have the most up-to-date figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When he wrote that (San Francisco Chronicle) op-ed, he didn&rsquo;t have that new number,&quot; Kersten told us in an interview. &quot;Everybody was using the older report.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt Shupe, Cox&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, said he and Kersten would update Cox on the new figure and use it in future statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High admin costs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox&rsquo;s staff noted that one category of California&rsquo;s road spending, administrative costs, totals nearly five times as much the national average, even in the 2016 report. We checked and the report does show that, though Cox&rsquo;s staffers acknowledged that&rsquo;s not the same statement the candidate made in the op-ed or in his Political Vanguard interview and at the center of this fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caltrans, the agency targeted by Cox, disagrees with the methodology of the Reason Foundation studies. A Caltrans spokesman said much of the studies&rsquo; roadway data is from local streets and roads not built or maintained by the state. The spokesman also noted that California&rsquo;s state roadways are larger and more congested than in other states, making them more expensive to build and maintain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives for the Reason Foundation did not respond to our interview requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed it costs &quot;nearly five times as much&quot; in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A study using 2009 data shows California spent 4.7 times as much per mile as the national average on roads. Updated data from 2013 shows the state&rsquo;s spending still far above the national average at about 2.5 times the cost per mile, but far lower than Cox&rsquo;s figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox&rsquo;s campaign staff told us the candidate relied on outdated information and would be updating this figure in future statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the candidate&rsquo;s larger point about higher road spending in California appears to be correct, his specific claim about it being &quot;nearly five times&quot; as much per mile is outdated and wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash;&nbsp;</em><em>The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Governor&rsquo;s race</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Cox&nbsp;is among several candidates&nbsp;competing to succeed Jerry Brown in the 2018 California governor&#39;s race.
