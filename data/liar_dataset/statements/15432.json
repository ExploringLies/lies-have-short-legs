But gun control advocates argue the proposal would lead to dangerous unintended consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time, yet the @NRA wants to arm volunteer teachers,&quot; Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/998759743412846592\">tweeted</a> May 21. &quot;It&#39;s on each of us to prevent this NRA dystopia, and stop letting the gun lobby write our gun laws. We&#39;re sacrificing our children at the altar of gun manufacturers&#39; profits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts may have a point that the average armed teacher might be less accurate&nbsp;than a trained cop. But&nbsp;her claim that trained police hit their target &quot;less than 30 percent of the time&quot; is not as clear-cut as Watts suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">New York Police Department</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, national numbers on police marksmanship are not readily available. But we found data on some individual jurisdictions, including several major metropolitan police departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aide to Watts pointed us to a 2008 Rand <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/public_information/RAND_FirearmEvaluation.pdf\">study</a> that looked at the accuracy of New York Police Department officer-involved shootings. The key data point is the &quot;hit rate,&quot; the number of rounds that struck a suspect divided by total shots fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rand study looked at NYPD firearm-discharge reports from from 1998 through 2006. Some of the findings point in Watts&rsquo; favor, while other data refutes her point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hit ratios were below 30 percent for gunfights (18 percent) and from long ranges (23 percent from more than seven yards away). However, in cases where suspects did not return fire, NYPD officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time. Accuracy levels were above 30 percent when the target was seven yards away or closer (37 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent data shows a further uptick in the NYPD&rsquo;s hit rate compared with the Rand study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspector Kevin Maloney, who headed up the NYPD unit that oversees police-involved shootings, told the <em>New York Daily News</em> in December 2017 that the NYPD fired a record low number of rounds that year. The department&rsquo;s hit ratio also exceeded those in the 2008 Rand study in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NYPD cops fired 170 shots and hit their targets 75 times, for a hit ratio of 44 percent for the year, as of Dec. 21, 2017. In 2016, police landed 107 of a total 304 shots fired, a hit ratio of roughly 35 percent. Again, Watts said the hit rate was less than 30 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Los Angeles Police Department</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent <a href=\"http://assets.lapdonline.org/assets/pdf/2016-use-of-force-year-end-review-small.pdf\">data</a> from the Los Angeles Police Department further undermines Watts&rsquo; claim. According to the LAPD&rsquo;s 2016 report, the average annual hit ratio from 2012 through 2016 was 33.4 percent, with a substantial uptick in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With a lot of training and reform, LAPD has a hit rate of 48 percent (in 2016). That is likely at the high end of hit rates,&quot; said Gregory Ridgeway, an associate professor of criminology and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. &quot;Their number of rounds per incident is also way down in the last five years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Other jurisdictions</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2006 study, Michael D.
