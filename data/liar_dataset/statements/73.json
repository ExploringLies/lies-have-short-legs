Here in America, people are dying because they couldn't get the care they needed when they were sick.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Clinton used the number to dramatize the need for universal coverage.\n</p>\n<p>\n The number comes from a report called \"Care Without Coverage: Too Little, Too Late,\" produced in 2002 by the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. The National Academy of Science is a private, nonprofit society of scholars. It was granted a charter by Congress in 1863 and has a mandate to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters.\n</p>\n<p>\n The report found that people without health care coverage:\n</p>\n<p>\n &bull; received less frequent or no use of cancer screening tests;\n</p>\n<p>\n &bull; received inconsistent care for the management of chronic disease;\n</p>\n<p>\n &bull; received fewer diagnostic and treatment services for trauma or heart attacks, and had an increased risk of death when in the hospital.\n</p>\n<p>\n The report concluded that \"excess deaths among uninsured adults ages 25&ndash;64, based on a 25 percent higher mortality risk, can be estimated to be in the range of 18,000 each year.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The report was independently reviewed.
