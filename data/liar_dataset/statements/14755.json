Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article states that Parks&rsquo; granddaughter defended Trump to denounce claims from &quot;Antifa&quot; protesters that Trump is a &quot;racist bigot&quot; and a &quot;traitor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article quoted Parks&rsquo; supposed granddaughter, Muriel Parks-Gouldman, speaking to students at Oxford University: &quot;This violence and destruction I see from my people is just unacceptable. My grandmother took a stand by sitting down, but she would never &lsquo;sit down&rsquo; while our once-proud people cover their faces and commit violent acts in the streets.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the story is fake because Rosa Parks was childless when she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/us/25parks.html\">died in 2005 at age 92</a>. The photo in the story is of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH2ND1lGP0Y\">Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosa Parks is a famous African-American civil rights icon who in 1955 refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Ala. The goal of the story appears to be to shock readers that a grandchild of Parks would side with Trump, who <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/14/context-president-donald-trumps-saturday-statement/\">called the violence in Charlottesville</a> a result of &quot;hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August, we fact-checked a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/23/blog-posting/fake-news-rosa-parks-had-no-daughter-could-praise-/\">similar claim</a> that &quot;Rosa Parks&rsquo; daughter praises (President Donald) Trump&rsquo;s response to Charlottesville.&quot; In that article, Parks&rsquo; daughter had a similar name: Muriel Parks-Rosenberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We messaged the website on Facebook and received a reply directing us to scroll to the bottom of the page.
