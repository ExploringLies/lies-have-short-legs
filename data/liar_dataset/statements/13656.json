Jerry Brown offered an energetic rebuke to the Trump administration&rsquo;s &quot;alternative facts&quot; and &quot;blatant attacks on science&quot; in his State of the State address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solidly blue state voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prompting Brown to reflect on California&rsquo;s place in a broader national context in a speech traditionally used to set a state policy agenda. Contrasting Trump&rsquo;s positions, Brown promised to oppose deportations of undocumented immigrants, to protect health care and to continue to act on climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal &mdash; the Under2 MOU &mdash; has 165 signatories, representing a billion people,&quot; Brown <a href=\"http://time.com/4645830/california-jerry-brown-donald-trump-speech-transcript/\">said</a>. &quot;We can do much on our own and we can join with others &ndash; other states and provinces and even countries, to stop the dangerous rise in climate pollution. And make no mistake, we are going to do exactly that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know more about what Brown was talking about and if it is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://under2mou.org/\">Under2 MOU</a>, or Subnational Global Climate Leadership Memorandum of Understanding, is a pact spearheaded by California and the German state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg in the leadup to the Paris agreement in 2015. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52731#.WIe0WFMrK70\">game changer</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its <a href=\"http://under2mou.org/coalition/\">165 members</a> represent about 1 billion people and pledge to limit carbon emissions to below 80 to 90 percent from 1990 levels with the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the same goal and framework of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/455/work-with-un-on-climate-change/\">Paris agreement</a>, the major international deal between nearly 200 nations. But there are a few differences between the two deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Brown&rsquo;s numbers need explanation. Of the Under2 MOU&rsquo;s 165 members, 155 are signatories, meaning they&#39;ve declared their commitment to limit emissions and to provide action plans. The other 10 are countries that have endorsed the MOU, meaning they support the goal but don&rsquo;t have to submit plans. &nbsp;<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QqrJtKtLmCA43JFXLkOseF0Z_Lj4IbFVlt2ZMP6xCxJi_BCqh9N2IdSKKdTsL8TjwxM_kR2Uf22_zUb2dsaYJAVe1R1IR68kV4O3qHwAIRXNvrY60wgyfO5BcsW_P1AeTrR3-o4N\" style=\"border:none; height:364px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the MOU is voluntary and nonbinding, and while the Paris deal is also voluntary, it includes <a href=\"https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=366007094000025110003108091086020022001059088011053070123107098125090066071068067029003030051022026006053068068006075110026100111026056021027093019011126095004076051000030064107006118027002102072102121015117070095084098082124064079113126111081031026&amp;EXT=pdf\">binding obligations</a> on reporting emissions and progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, unlike the MOU, the Paris agreement has increasingly stringent targets for signatories. The United States, for example, <a href=\"http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/United%20States%20of%20America%20First/U.S.A.%20First%20NDC%20Submission.pdf\">pledged</a> to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and then 26 to 28 percent percent by 2025 (equivalent to 19 to 24 percent from 1990 levels). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these differences, experts we spoke with said the Under2 MOU was a strong and forceful compact. But they said the MOU was a complement to the Paris agreement rather than its equivalent in terms of potential impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They&rsquo;re part and parcel to each other. If you&rsquo;re driving those kind of reductions, those can help you get to the national targets. They&rsquo;re not distinct realms. They&rsquo;re nested within each other,&quot; said Brendan Guy, the international policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the MOU, California pledged to reduce emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-jerry-brown-signs-climate-laws-20160908-snap-story.html\">actually enacted legislation</a> that codifies the target and sets a regulatory process in place. That&rsquo;s a &quot;really high watermark&quot; that hardly any national governments have met, said Danny Cullenward, an energy economist at Carnegie Institute for Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts also pointed to California&rsquo;s five-year-old <a href=\"https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/capandtrade.htm\">cap-and-trade program</a> (which the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/456/create-cap-and-trade-system-with-interim-goals-to-/\">tried but failed</a> to implement on a national scale), extended <a href=\"http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/RPS_Homepage/\">renewable portfolio standards</a> and its pledge to get <a href=\"http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables/tracking_progress/documents/electric_vehicle.pdf\">1.5 million zero emissions cars</a> on the road by 2025 as examples of strong climate change action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just how far-reaching are these targets and policies? To state the obvious, cities and states do not account for all of a country&rsquo;s emissions, so their reduction pledges will not have an equivalent impact to a national commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California, despite being the largest state and equivalent to the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2016/jul/26/kevin-de-leon/does-california-really-have-sixth-largest-economy-/\">world&rsquo;s sixth-largest economy</a>, accounts for <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/analysis/pdf/table1.pdf\">6 to 7 percent</a> of the United States&rsquo; emissions. The other nine U.S. states that are part of the MOU (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont&nbsp;and Washington) represent another 10 percent of the country&rsquo;s total emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at it another way, if all 23,458 cities from the Energy Department&#39;s city energy profile tool enacted best energy-saving practices, it would lead to a 3 to 7 percent reduction in emissions, <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/67101.pdf\">according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Will these subnational efforts be enough to prevent a dangerous increase in average global temperature? Probably not,&quot; said Rachel Krause, a University of Kansas professor who focuses on local policy and sustainability. &quot;But they still can have meaningful impact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cullenward pointed out that the&nbsp;Paris agreement&rsquo;s depth is the result of two decades of negotiations, while the MOU is a relatively new compact and will likely become much more sophisticated over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s no substitute for eventual national action. But it&rsquo;s a really appropriate strategy where you have national governments that aren&rsquo;t interested in taking action on climate change,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown said, &quot;194 countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal &mdash; the Under2 MOU &mdash; has 165 signatories, representing a billion people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Under2 MOU, spearheaded&nbsp;by California and the Germany state&nbsp;Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, is a climate change agreement signed by 155 cities and states that have pledged reductions in carbon emissions and endorsed by 10 countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While its emissions impact is not as far-reaching as the Paris agreement, experts told us it is a very similar deal that fosters international cooperation on climate change and fills a void in times of national hesitation to act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Brown&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"sharethefacts_microdata_embed\" data-sharethefacts-uuid=\"aafaca91-c160-4412-9c26-444a46827b1e\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; padding: 10px 10px 30px 10px; margin-bottom: 50px; color: gray; font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ClaimReview\"> <div style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Share the Facts</div> <div style=\"width: auto; margin: 20px 25px 20px 25px\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\"> <div itemprop=\"name\"><a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com\">Politifact</a></div> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-mostlytrue.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact\" /> </div> <div style=\"font-size: 14px; margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\"> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\">1</div> <div style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"bestRating\">6</div> <img style=\"display: none;\" itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/share-the-facts/rating_images/politifact/tom-mostlytrue.jpg\" alt=\"Politifact rating logo\" /> Politifact Rating: <div style=\"font-weight: bold\" itemprop=\"alternateName\"></div> </div> <div style=\"margin: 20px 0px 10px 0px\" itemprop=\"claimReviewed\">\"One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases.
