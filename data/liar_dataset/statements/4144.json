It claims Darling&rsquo;s challenger, state Rep. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/assembly/asm22/news/biography.htm\">Sandy Pasch</a>, D-Whitefish Bay, also backed a sizable school funding cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe attack is part of a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/audio/WI+Club+For+Growth.mp3\">radio </a><a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/audio/WI+Club+For+Growth.mp3\">ad</a> that began airing about a week before Pasch won the Democratic primary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClub for Growth, which <a href=\"http://wicfg.wordpress.com/about/\">advocates</a> for &quot;limited government and minimal taxation,&quot; mostly branded Pasch as a tax-and-spender in the ad. But at one point, the female narrator says Pasch voted to &quot;to cut school aid by nearly $300 million.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClub for Growth also makes the school aid claim in similar ads that have targeted two other Assembly Democrats who are challenging incumbent Republicans in recall races, <a href=\"http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/article_800a6920-9e1b-11e0-928b-001cc4c002e0.html\">according</a> to the <em>La Crosse Tribune</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey are Rep. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, running against Sen. Dan Kapanke of La Crosse; and Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo, challenging Luther Olsen of Ripon. Those elections, and the Pasch-Darling contest, are on Aug. 9, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked for evidence to back the claim against Pasch, Club for Growth spokesman R. J. Johnson cited a May 2009 <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/45662272.html\">article</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt referred to the 2009-2011 budget submitted by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, which proposed cutting state aid for schools by $290 million. That was before the Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, voted on the budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a month later, Pasch joined all but two Assembly Democrats in <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/49163297.html\">approving</a> the spending plan. The final budget cut general school aid by <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/2009-11Budget/JFC/2009_06_10WILeg_possible%20effects%20of%20reduced%20general%20school%20aids.pdf\">$294 million</a> -- to $9.3 billion -- over two years, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Club for Growth Wisconsin is correct in saying Pasch voted to cut school aid nearly $300 million. But is that whole story?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the same article cited by Club for Growth, Doyle said total spending on public schools would actually rise by about 5 percent because schools would get an additional $877 million in federal stimulus funds. That seemed to indicate that stimulus money would more than offset the state aid reduction. Gillian Morris, Pasch&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, said that was also her understanding of what happened.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that was not the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the fiscal bureau and the state Department of Public Instruction, the $294 million aid reduction took into account both the cut in state funds and the federal stimulus money that was added in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, the stimulus money was not enough to offset the state funding cut. The net result for schools was a reduction in funding of $294 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn sum, Club for Growth Wisconsin claimed that Pasch voted to cut nearly $300 million in aid to schools. The record shows the claim was on the mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-19T17:44:02.869148", "ruling_date": "2011-07-20T09:09:00", "ruling_headline": "Club for Growth Wisconsin ad says Senate recall candidate Sandy Pasch voted to cut school aid by $300 million", "ruling_headline_slug": "club-growth-wisconsin-ad-says-senate-recall-candid", "ruling_link_text": "Federal stimulus money didn't offset a cut in state aid", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tEmail interview, <a href=\"http://wicfg.com/\">Club for Growth </a><a href=\"http://wicfg.com/\">Wisconsin</a> spokesman R.J.
