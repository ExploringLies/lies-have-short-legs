Tammy Baldwin of Madison gave the most important speech of her political career, to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., a disparaging email made the rounds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin is facing former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson in a bid for a key open U.S. Senate seat, the one now held by Democrat Herb Kohl.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email criticized Baldwin, who had said that her Sept. 6, 2012, convention speech would focus on &quot;heartland values.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the email message:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yesterday, Madison-Liberal Tammy Baldwin cited &quot;heartland values&quot; as the topic for her prime time speech to the DNC tomorrow night. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\tClearly, there&#39;s no one better positioned to talk &quot;heartland values&quot; than Tammy&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email included a link to a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7YDaXqyL-Y\">YouTube video</a>and then added these words: &quot;A primer of her values---note event, and enjoy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe video is of Baldwin, who would be the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate, dancing on stage with a costumed band at a 2010 gay pride event in Madison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email -- and several similar tweets &nbsp;-- were sent to more than a dozen conservative political contacts, including bloggers and those in the media, by Brian Nemoir, senior adviser/communications for the Thompson campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the recipients forwarded the email to WisPolitics.com, which wrote the first story on the matter and <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml\">called the messages</a>&quot;a negative hit from Tommy Thompson&rsquo;s campaign.&quot;The tweets were sent from Nemoir&rsquo;s personal account, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/thompson-aide-posted-baldwin-video-says-he-wasn-t-representing/article_f7ae87a6-f87c-11e1-bb05-0019bb2963f4.html\">according to the Wisconsin State Journal.</a>That account has since added privacy settings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe emails drew a far broader audience, and quickly drew attention -- and criticism -- since it was the first time Baldwin&rsquo;s sexual orientation had been made an issue in the contentious campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an email to reporters, another Thompson aide, Darrin Schmitz, wrote that Nemoir &quot;acted on his own&quot; and &quot;he was not representing the Thompson campaign in this matter.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that accurate?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s pause for a quick note: When we examine claims from campaign spokespersons, we typically attribute the statement to the candidate. After all, that is what spokespersons are hired to do -- speak for the candidate. We will do that here when evaluating the statement issued by Schmitz, who like Nemoir, has frequently spoken to the media on behalf of the campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFive days after the emails were sent, Thompson <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-says-aides-messages-about-baldwin-were-inappropriate-3k6qqqv-169356086.html\">told reporters after an appearance in Milwaukee:</a>&quot;I thought it was a mistake, I&#39;m sorry, and he&#39;s apologized, I believe. He shouldn&#39;t have done it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson also said a person&#39;s sexual orientation is &quot;absolutely not an issue&quot; in the race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the email was made public, Nemoir&rsquo;s role with the campaign changed, and he was replaced as the campaign&rsquo;s spokesman, according to Thompson.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what about that not-part-of-the-campaign claim about the email?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked to back up that position, Schmitz said Nemoir&rsquo;s email was an &quot;unauthorized statement.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As you well know, this is not the first time an employee of any business, organization, campaign or media outlet has shared personal thoughts through a work email,&quot; Schmitz said in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMaybe so, but some things just don&rsquo;t add up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the past, most of Nemoir&rsquo;s correspondence with reporters had been through his email address with his consulting firm, Full Impact Communications. This email was sent from his &nbsp;email account with the Thompson campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email contained Nemoir&rsquo;s name and listed his then-position with the campaign: senior adviser/communications. It also contained the web address for the Thompson campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt certainly appeared official.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, it arrived a key political moment in the campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was sent out hours in advance of Baldwin&rsquo;s convention speech, and was tied directly to the theme of that speech &quot;heartland values.&quot; Although the email text didn&rsquo;t note her sexual orientation in depth, the link made the message was clear: Baldwin does not represent &quot;heartland values&quot; because she is gay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This sounds like a good/bad cop routine. An aide makes an attack through the campaign but the organization disavows the attack,&quot; said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. &quot;This can be a very effective strategy if the media pick up the attack.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWest added that &quot;making an issue of someone&#39;s sexuality is not a casual decision. Campaigns think very carefully about the up and downside of that.&quot; He likened the message to &quot;lobbing a nuclear bomb into a meadow.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Thompson consultant said the campaign was not responsible for an email that criticized Baldwin as not representing &quot;heartland values.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the email came from the campaign&rsquo;s chief spokesman on a campaign account at a key political moment in the campaign. It was sent to conservative bloggers and others. It was clearly meant to draw attention to the video of Baldwin&rsquo;s appearance at the gay pride event.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe average reader of the email got the message loud and clear: Thompson&rsquo;s campaign was criticizing Baldwin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSchmitz&rsquo;s statement is false, and it&rsquo;s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-14T16:53:05.296375", "ruling_date": "2012-09-17T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Thompson says aide wasn\u2019t representing campaign in email criticizing sexual orientation of Baldwin", "ruling_headline_slug": "thompson-says-aide-wasnt-representing-campaign-ema", "ruling_link_text": "Email was from aide's campaign account", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin State Journal, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/thompson-aide-posted-baldwin-video-says-he-wasn-t-representing/article_f7ae87a6-f87c-11e1-bb05-0019bb2963f4.html\">&quot;Thompson aide posted Balwin video, says he wasn&rsquo;t representing campaign,&quot;</a>Sept. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel,<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-says-aides-messages-about-baldwin-were-inappropriate-3k6qqqv-169356086.html\">&quot;Thompson says aide&rsquo;s messages about Baldwin were a mistake,&quot;</a>Sept. 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-campaign-head-emails-video-of-baldwin-at-gay-pride-event-i86p16c-168801486.html\">&quot;Thompson campaign official emails video of Baldwin at gay pride event,&quot;</a>Sept. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails, Darrin Schmitz, Thompson campaign, Sept. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisPolitics.com<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails, Darrell West, vice president and director of goverance studies, Brookings Institution, Sept. 13, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Tommy", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 14, "last_name": "Thompson", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "tommy-thompson", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-tommythompson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/14/", "total_count": 29, "true_count": 3, "website": "https://www.tommyforwisconsin.com/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=2&gclid=CPiG95D88qwCFUJjTAodElamlg"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tAn aide &quot;acted on his own&quot; and &quot;was not representing the Thompson campaign&quot; when he sent an email criticizing the sexual orientation of U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an email ", "statement_date": "2012-09-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Tammy", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 1410, "last_name": "Baldwin", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "tammy-baldwin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT_Tammy_Baldwin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1410/", "total_count": 49, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.baldwin.senate.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
