Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/837343380548042752\">called</a> for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign over taking meetings with the Russian ambassador <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/mar/02/context-what-jeff-sessions-told-al-franken-about-m/\">without disclosing</a> it to Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, defended the one-on-one he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak because it was part of his duties as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a surrogate for President Donald Trump&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a retort, McCaskill, also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she never met with Kislyak, who has held his position since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign (Relations Committee),&quot; she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/837272862432104448\">tweeted March 2</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>But McCaskill&rsquo;s own earlier tweets show that that&rsquo;s not the case. She has communicated with the Russian ambassador, at least twice, to discuss policy matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions, even those in process,&quot; she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/296640293229457409\">tweeted on Jan. 30, 2013</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/us-lawmakers-press-russia-to-ease-adoption-ban/437040/\">Atlantic</a></em> has a picture of that very meeting, showing McCaskill (and a few other senators) sitting across the table from Kislyak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/629258099942105088\">April 2015</a>, she tweeted: &quot;Today calls with British, Russian, and German Ambassadors re: Iran deal. #doingmyhomework.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill&rsquo;s interactions with Kislyak were materially different than Sessions&rsquo;. Sessions met with Kislyak one-on-one around the same time Russian actors are believed to have been meddling in the election. McCaskill, on the other hand, met him in a group setting to discuss adoption policy and in a brief phone call about the Iran nuclear deal, Feldman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few hours after tweeting that she never met with the Russian ambassador, McCaskill published two clarifications, downplaying the significance of the two interactions she had with Kislyak.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>She also <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/02/politics/claire-mccaskill-jeff-sessions-russian-ambassador-meeting/\">told CNN</a> that Twitter&rsquo;s 140-character limit prevented her from initially saying she never received a call <em>from</em> the ambassador, as opposed to the call she made <em>to</em> the ambassador about the Iran deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sessions had two interactions with Kislyak in 2016. The first was in an informal group setting at a July 2016 event for diplomats at the Republican National Convention. And the second was a private meeting in Sessions&rsquo; former Senate office in September. Who initiated the private meeting and what was discussed is so far unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In specifying that she never met with Kislyak on Armed Services Committee business, &quot;McCaskill seems to have inadvertently supported Sessions&rsquo; claims,&quot; said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. &quot;She made an unequivocal statement and then had to go back and qualify it by saying she was speaking just about one of her roles and not the other.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCaskill said, &quot;I&rsquo;ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/ Russian ambassador. Ever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCaskill&rsquo;s own tweets show that she has had an in-person group meeting, as well as a phone call, with the Russian ambassador in the past four years. A McCaskill spokesperson contrasted these interactions with the private one-on-one meeting Sessions had in his office with the ambassador. However, though the context for McCaskill&rsquo;s and Sessions&rsquo; interactions with Kislyak may be very different, she goes too far in saying she didn&rsquo;t &quot;ever&quot; have that meeting or phone call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate McCaskill&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-02T16:40:12.262702", "ruling_date": "2017-03-02T17:34:39", "ruling_headline": "Claire McCaskill says she never met with Russian ambassador, past tweets say otherwise", "ruling_headline_slug": "claire-mccaskill-says-she-never-met-russian-ambass", "ruling_link_text": "There's a photo of the meeting", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>McCaskill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clairecmc/\">Twitter feed</a>, accessed March 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/03/02/senator-mccaskills-misfired-tweet-on-contacts-with-the-russian-ambassador/?utm_term=.acfdc4f45347\">Sen.
