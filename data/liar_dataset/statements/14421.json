The post had attracted 16,700 views through Aug. 11. So we decided to take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, the headline and some of the text in the article offered a garbled account of what had actually happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson, reportedly an independent, has indeed flirted with making a presidential run in 2020, though it remains to be seen how serious his is about a bid. In May, when he hosted the season finale of NBC&rsquo;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8np0DiQQnP4\">joined with</a> fellow actor Tom Hanks under a large banner reading &quot;Johnson Hanks 2020&quot; as confetti flooded the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-for-president-cover\">talked</a> about the growing buzz about a candidacy with GQ writer Caity Weaver in June 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weaver wrote: &quot;Johnson doesn&#39;t hesitate when I ask him whether he honestly might one day give up his life as the highest-paid movie star on earth &mdash; which is unquestionably easier, more fun, and more lucrative than being president of the United States &mdash; in order to run for office. &#39;I think that it&#39;s a real possibility,&rsquo; he says solemnly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then someone took it seriously and filed papers with the Federal Election Commission -- but contrary to the Rearfront.com article, it wasn&rsquo;t Johnson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 9, Kenton Tilford of Wheeling, W. Va., filed <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00649723/1168850/\">paperwork</a> to formally establish &quot;Run The Rock 2020.&quot; It is what&rsquo;s known as a draft committee -- an organization created &quot;solely to draft an individual or to encourage him or her to become a candidate for federal office,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/registering-pac/naming-nonconnected-pac/\">according to the Federal Election Commission</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paperwork says that the committee supports &quot;only one candidate &hellip; Dwayne Douglas Johnson.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the Rearfront.com item gets it wrong is when it says that Johnson himself has &quot;officially filed&quot; as a 2020 presidential candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is flatly wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paperwork itself clarifies Run the Rock 2020 &quot;is NOT an Authorized Committee,&quot; meaning that it was not established by the candidate being supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Run the Rock 2020 <a href=\"https://runtherock2020.com/\">website</a> offers T-shirts for $20.20 to fund its grassroots effort. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tilford confirmed to PolitiFact that the Rearfront.com post &quot;is indeed incorrect.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have not been in touch with Mr. Johnson or his representatives,&quot; Tilford told PolitiFact. &quot;I&#39;m simply a private citizen who formed a draft committee to rally like-minded people around the goal of encouraging him to run. As far as I know, Mr. Johnson and his representatives have not commented on the matter. We filed paperwork with the FEC because we hope to raise money and develop a real presence to show him the energy on the ground for his candidacy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That explanation squares with what Tilford had earlier told <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3990105/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-president-files-2020-election-campaign/\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dwayne-johnson-for-president-committee-files-with-fec/\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-campaign-committee-2020/index.html\">news</a> <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2017/07/13/inside-the-campaign-that-wants-the-rock-to-be-president/\">outlets</a> that he has not talked to Johnson himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to his <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenton-tilford-74724950/\">LinkedIn page</a>, Tilford graduated from Knox College in 2012 and has worked on campaigns in New Jersey and Louisiana. He was also a field organizer for Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2012 presidential campaign in Clayton County, Iowa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did not hear back from two representatives of Johnson&rsquo;s camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the headline&rsquo;s message that The Rock is locked in for 2020, we rate that statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-11T15:34:37.036105", "ruling_date": "2017-08-14T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Dwayne the Rock Johnson officially file to run for president in 2020?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-dwayne-rock-johnson-officially-file-run-presid", "ruling_link_text": "The group that filed WANTS Johnson to run", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rearfront.com, &quot;&quot;Dwayne &#39;The Rock&#39; (Johnson) Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign,&quot; Aug. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rearfront.com, <a href=\"http://www.rearfront.com/about-us/\">About Us page</a>, accessed Aug. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dwayne Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8np0DiQQnP4\"><em>Saturday Night Live</em> monologue</a>, May 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GQ, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/dwayne-johnson-for-president-cover\">Dwayne Johnson for President!</a>&quot; June 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Election Commission, <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00649723/1168850/\">paperwork</a> to create Run the Rock 2020, July 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Election Commission, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/registering-pac/naming-nonconnected-pac/\">Naming a nonconnected PAC</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Run the Rock 2020 <a href=\"https://runtherock2020.com/\">website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kenton Tilford, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenton-tilford-74724950/\">LinkedIn page</a>, accessed Aug. 11, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Sun</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3990105/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-president-files-2020-election-campaign/\">Rock the House</a>,&quot; July 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/politics/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-campaign-committee-2020/index.html\">West Virginia resident creates &#39;Run The Rock 2020&#39; campaign committee</a>,&quot; July 10, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2017/07/13/inside-the-campaign-that-wants-the-rock-to-be-president/\">Inside the campaign that wants The Rock to be president</a>,&quot; July 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dwayne-johnson-for-president-committee-files-with-fec/\">Committee files to draft Dwayne Johnson for president</a>,&quot; July 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kenton Tilford, founder of Run the Rock 2020, Aug. 11, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Viral website", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4019, "last_name": "Rearfront.com", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "rearfrontcom", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rearfront_logo.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4019/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.rearfront.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Dwayne &#39;The Rock&#39; (Johnson) Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a web post", "statement_date": "2017-08-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
