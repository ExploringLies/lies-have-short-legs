David N. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke on the issue. Cicilline this year sponsored a bill, which has more than 60 co-sponsors, that would close what supporters refer to as the &quot;fire sale loophole.&quot; The bill is still pending in a Congressional committee and it is unclear when, or if, it will be taken up.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;If you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you&#39;ve engaged in misconduct or because you&#39;ve sold guns to people who shouldn&#39;t have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection,&quot; Cicilline said. &nbsp;&quot;You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we contacted Cicilline&rsquo;s office to check his claim, spokesman Richard Luchette referred us to the federal firearms law. &nbsp;We found <a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C44.txt\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Section 923 of Title 18, Chapter 44,</a> which includes some of the regulations on federally-licensed firearms dealers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the law doesn&rsquo;t specifically address what gun dealers who lose their federal licenses can do with the firearms in their inventory. That absence, according to Cicilline and other gun-control supporters, is a serious loophole, allowing dealers to transfer their inventory into a personal collection and then sell those firearms -- without requiring buyers to submit to a background check.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLuchette also sent us links to a couple of examples provided by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, headed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. (Cicilline was among 15 mayors who in 2006 -- he was Providence mayor at the time -- attended the first summit, hosted by Bloomberg, that helped to launch the group.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne example the group cited dated to 2006 and involved a Maryland gun dealer who had lost his license for multiple violations in which firearms in his sales inventory were unaccounted for.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter the dealer filed a federal lawsuit against the director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, &nbsp;the U.S. Department of Justice issued a legal opinion that said &quot;&lsquo;when a dealer loses his license he can dispose of his inventory by selling those firearms without being deemed to have engaged in the business in violation of&quot; a federal law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe gun dealer would violate the law only &quot;if he chooses to purchase and resell firearms,&quot; the opinion stated</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Maryland dealer was found to be within his rights to transfer some 700 guns into his personal inventory and continue to sell them, despite having a record of previous violations in which guns in his inventory were unaccounted for, so long as he did not buy any additional weapons, according to <a href=\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-07-13/news/0607130118_1_abrams-gun-dealers-gun-shop/2\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">an article in the Baltimore Sun</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe other example cited by the mayors&rsquo; organization was an Ohio firearm dealer allowed to sell what had been remaining in his inventory after his federal license had been revoked.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeeking an independent point of view, we contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, the federal agency that handles federal licensing of firearms dealers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn ATF spokeswoman, Debora Seifert, said that once someone is no longer a federally licensed firearms dealer, either voluntarily or because his license is revoked for some misconduct, then &quot;they are citizens, so they have the ability to convert the firearms from their [sales inventory] into their own personal inventory.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, she said, dealers who are no longer federally licensed do not come under the ATF&rsquo;s purview. Because they are no longer subject to the federal jurisdiction of ATF, they can conceivably sell those firearms. Those sale are free from federal requirements for background checks of buyers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSiefert said some states may have their own laws that curtail firearms sales under those circumstances. Rhode Island is one of those states.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmy Kempe, spokeswoman for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin, said that &quot;Rhode Island is not a &lsquo;loophole&rsquo; state.&quot; The state&rsquo;s law &quot;requires a background check and waiting period before any firearm is transferred to any purchaser so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the seller has [a federal firearms license] or not,&quot; she said by e-mail.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCicilline said that &quot;if you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you&#39;ve engaged in misconduct or because you&#39;ve sold guns to people who shouldn&#39;t have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection &hellip;You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn ATF spokeswoman confirmed that is true. And examples of ex-dealers selling their inventories have occurred and been documented.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">True</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
