But it&#39;s up to the governor and the General Assembly to figure out how to do it and how the burdens of the balancing act should be shared.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGov. John Kasich took the lead in that process with what he called the &quot;jobs budget,&quot; a spending blueprint that includes cuts to local governments and school districts and to state agencies to close an $800 billion budget shortfall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich unveiled his spending plan March 15, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a public forum at the Idea Center at Playhouse Square, State Sen. Nina Turner said she feared the governor was &quot;balancing the budget on the backs of employees&quot; and would impair the government&#39;s ability to provide services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen &quot;the governor announced his &#39;jobs budget,&#39; 99 folks from the Department of Taxation were let go the next day,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn March 16, the state said it will close seven regional Taxpayer Service Centers on June 30 -- the end of the fiscal year -- resulting in the loss of nearly 100 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Commissioner Joe Testa sent e-mail notices to employees at regional Taxpayer Service Centers in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, Youngstown and Zanesville. The Columbus center will remain open.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWorkers in the Cleveland office told The Plain Dealer the closings are a mistake that will hurt taxpayers and hurt tax revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the tax department said the revenues are about half of the $7 million the state will save. Testa said the offices have only a fraction of the calls and walk-in traffic they once did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the governor&#39;s office about the job cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s in the context of what we want to do with the budget as a whole,&quot; spokesman Rob Nichols said. &quot;We inherited an $8 billion budget hole. We had the seventh-highest taxes in the nation last year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe closing of the service centers is in line with a promise the governor made during his campaign: to shrink state government and make it more efficient.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This budget presents a spending blueprint that Ohio taxpayers can finally afford,&quot; Nichols said. &quot;We can&#39;t keep doing what we&#39;re doing and expect to succeed in this state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether closing the tax service centers and laying off workers is a good idea is a question for someone else to answer. But Kasich is doing it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat rates Turner&rsquo;s statement as True on the Truth-O-Meter.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-10T16:31:44.777188", "ruling_date": "2011-05-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Sen.
