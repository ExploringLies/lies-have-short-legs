John Kasich as the Republican nominee for president. PolitiFact rated the claim Half-True. Here&#39;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put that $1 trillion number in perspective,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\"><u>the national debt</u></a>&nbsp;has reached nearly $19.2 trillion, or more than $60,000 for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html\"><u>every man, woman and child</u></a>&nbsp;in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has looked at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/apr/07/politifacts-guide-2016-candidates-tax-plans/\"><u>presidential candidates&#39; tax plans</u></a>&nbsp;and, for the Clinton proposal, we relied on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000638-an-analysis-of-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals.pdf\"><u>a March 3, 2016, analysis</u></a>&nbsp;by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center says that Clinton&#39;s proposal would indeed increase tax revenue by $1 trillion &mdash; $1.1 trillion in fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that money would be raised over 10 years. Clinton, even if she were elected in November and reelected in 2020, wouldn&#39;t be in office that long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reagan&#39;s message on behalf of New Day misses another point that may make the increase less onerous to most voters: &quot;Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes,&quot; according to the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, filers with an adjusted gross income higher than $1 million would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Any money earned above $5 million per year would be assessed an extra 4 percent surcharge. (The surcharge would kick in at $2.5 million for married couples filing separately.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&#39;s plan also aims to discourage multinational corporations from using various schemes to lower or eliminate the taxes they have to pay in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, according to the report, her proposal would make the tax code more complex and the higher tax rates for the people who earn the most money would reduce &quot;incentives to work, save and invest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we heard back from New Day for America, spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp directed us to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-hillary-clinton-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2596292\"><u>Clinton&#39;s interview with the&nbsp;</u><em><u>New York Daily News</u></em></a>&nbsp;and an analysis by the conservative&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atr.org/hillary-confirms-trillion-dollar-tax-hike-plan\"><u>Americans for Tax Reform</u></a>, both of which make it clear that the $1 trillion would be raised over 10 years, a distinction made by neither New Day nor Reagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Liberals may think increasing taxes by $1 trillion is a good idea, but we very strongly disagree,&quot; Wehrkamp said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Day spokesman Michael Reagan said, &quot;Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion.&quot; Pence repeated a similar claim in Pennsylvania during a campaign stop this week, saying &quot;Hillary wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her plan does, in fact, call for raising a trillion dollars, but it would do so over 10 years &mdash; longer than she could serve as president, even if she were re-elected. So if she brought in roughly $100 billion per year, even a two-term Clinton administration couldn&#39;t fulfill a promise to bring the total to $1 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the statement ignores another key bit of data &mdash; that the money would be raised by tax changes targeted to the richest Americans, a group that has seen its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/fed_individual_rate_history_nominal.pdf\">top tax rate drop dramatically</a>&nbsp;since the 1950s and early 1960s, when the marginal tax rate was over 90 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-24T12:54:19.730282", "ruling_date": "2016-08-25T09:59:48", "ruling_headline": "In PA, Pence repeats half-true claim that Clinton would raise taxes by a trillion dollars", "ruling_headline_slug": "pa-pence-repeats-half-true-claim-clinton-would-rai", "ruling_link_text": "He's missing some key context here.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bureau of the Public Debt,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">&nbsp;<u>The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It</u></a>, accessed April 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau,<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html\">&nbsp;<u>U.S. &amp;
