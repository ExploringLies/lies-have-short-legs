Unfortunately, Congressman Sean Duffy does not abide by this belief and voted twice to end Medicare and make seniors pay thousands more for their health care, all to give more tax breaks to multimillionaires and corporations who ship our jobs overseas.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHmmm. Duffy, who represents a northwestern Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=202723823489805775580.0004a41f34e2cee11f2eb&amp;ll=45.706179,-90.878906&amp;spn=2.685272,4.669189&amp;z=7&amp;source=embed\">district</a>, voted twice to end Medicare, the federal program that pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Deja vu</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere have we heard before that Republicans voted end Medicare?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOh, yeah.

And The Washington Post&rsquo;s Fact Checker said that while there&rsquo;s &quot;a worthwhile debate&quot; about whether Ryan&rsquo;s proposal should be adopted, &quot;it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to &lsquo;kill&rsquo; Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat makes three fact checkers knocking down the claim that Republicans voted to end Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNevertheless, now comes Kreitlow.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Kreitlow&#39;s case</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe evidence to back his claim are Duffy&#39;s votes in <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/15/6478024-ryan-budget-plan-passes-house-only-4-gop-reps-vote-no?lite\">April 2011</a> and <a href=\"http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/2/151?ref=politics\">March 2012</a> for Ryan&#39;s budget proposals, said Kreitlow campaign manager Jocelyn Steinberg. The proposals would replace Medicare with a voucher, she claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteinberg cited statements in eight news or opinion articles, including some that vehemently disagreed with PolitiFact&rsquo;s Lie of the Year selection.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong them:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/politifact-r-i-p/\">claimed</a> Ryan&#39;s 2011 plan &quot;ends Medicare and leaves seniors with a voucher and no guarantee they can afford health care costs that would double.&quot; The Economist magazine <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/04/medicare_reform?page=2\">opined</a> that the plan &quot;ends the guarantee that all American seniors will have health insurance.&quot; And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/25159\">said</a> &quot;most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s no question Ryan&#39;s 2011 and 2012 budgets, neither of which were adopted, would have dramatically changed Medicare; indeed PolitiFact National rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/25/agenda-project/throw-granny-cliff-ad-says-paul-ryan-plan-would-pr/\">Mostly True</a> a claim that his plan would privatize Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs our colleagues noted in that item:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan&rsquo;s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, &nbsp;although they would receive &quot;premium support&quot; -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe point is, Medicare would change -- significantly -- under the proposals Duffy supported. But it would still exist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked to respond to Kreitlow&#39;s claim, Duffy campaign manager Justin Richards simply noted PolitiFact National&#39;s Lie of the Year selection.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKreitlow said Duffy &quot;voted twice to end Medicare.&quot; But under the proposals Duffy voted for, a revamped Medicare would remain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt this stage, Kreitlow&rsquo;s statement is false and ridiculous -- Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-22T13:34:21.832801", "ruling_date": "2012-06-25T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Dem challenger to GOP U.S. Rep.
