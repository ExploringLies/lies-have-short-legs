The article focused on comments by Neil Barofsky, special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion Wall Street bailout in 2008 that includes a mortgage modification program launched in 2009. According to the AP, Barofsky concluded that the administration&#39;s &quot;foreclosure-prevention effort has been ineffective in tackling the foreclosure crisis.&quot;<br goog_docs_charindex=\"1540\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"1541\" />\r\n\tBarofsky issued a 338-page <a goog_docs_charindex=\"1569\" href=\"http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2010/October2010_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf\">quarterly report</a> about TARP to Congress on Oct. 26, the day of the debate.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"1645\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"1646\" />\r\n\tThe report states on Page 6: &quot;Finally, the most specific of TARP&#39;s Main Street goals, &#39;preserving homeownership,&#39; has so far fallen woefully short with TARP&#39;s portion of the Administration&#39;s mortgage modification program yielding only approximately 207,000&nbsp;... ongoing permanent modifications since TARP&#39;s inception, a number that stands in stark contrast to the 5.5 million homes receiving foreclosure filings and more than 1.7 million homes that have been lost to foreclosure since January 2009.&quot;<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2169\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2170\" />\r\n\tFunded through TARP, the Home Affordable Mortgage Modification Program is intended to help prevent foreclosure by modifying mortgages. By the end of September 2010, HAMP spent about $483 million in TARP money.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2380\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2381\" />\r\n\tThe report shows a <a goog_docs_charindex=\"2401\" href=\"http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2010/October2010_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf\">chart</a> on page 74 that 1,369,414 mortgage modification trials had started by the end of September 2010. The chart states that 699,924 trials had been cancelled -- so note that is slightly more than half. The chart doesn&#39;t use the word &quot;temporary&quot; for any of the trials -- but it is clear that the 699,924 figure refers to temporary because another line on the chart shows that nearly 500,000 trials were converted to &quot;permanent.&quot; Of those permanent modifications, the majority survived while almost 29,000 were cancelled.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2924\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2925\" />\r\n\tRubio stated that the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications were temporary.

Anderson listed them for us:&nbsp;&quot;Borrowers not providing sufficient documentation to servicers, trial plan payment default, or a homeowner who is ineligible because their housing expense is already below the program&#39;s 31% threshold.&quot;&nbsp;<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4026\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4027\" />\r\n\tWe called and e-mailed Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos on Oct. 27.

His claim requires some clarification -- of the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications that started out as temporary, nearly 700,000 in the trial phase were cancelled -- or 51 percent. So Rubio is correct on &quot;over half&quot; but wrong to conclude that all of those had &quot;defaulted.&quot; Defaulting was the second most common reason for cancellation, therefore we rate this claim Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-27T17:40:44.735420", "ruling_date": "2010-10-27T19:12:12", "ruling_headline": "Rubio claims that among more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications, more than half defaulted", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-claims-among-more-13-million-temporary-mortg", "ruling_link_text": "Not all that were canceled were due to default", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWESH TV, <a goog_docs_charindex=\"5749\" href=\"http://www.wesh.com/video/25529624/detail.html\">&quot;U.S. Senate debate: Addressing the Housing Crisis&quot;,</a> Oct. 26, 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5817\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5818\" />\r\n\t<em>St. Petersburg Times</em>, <a goog_docs_charindex=\"5841\" href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/marco-rubios-personal-finances-clash-with-call-for-fiscal-discipline/1129566\">&quot;Marco Rubio&#39;s personal finances clash with call for fiscal discipline,&quot;</a> Oct. 22, 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5929\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5930\" />\r\n\tAP, <a goog_docs_charindex=\"5935\" href=\"http://hosted2.ap.org/txdam/1d938dec0a684376b6aa96349f9c9e98/Article_2010-10-25-US-Mortgage-Aid/id-fe6dde55bda14e51a457117dd917c121\">&quot;Official blasts Treasury over foreclosure program,&quot;</a> Oct. 25, 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6003\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6004\" />\r\n\tSpecial Inspector General of Troubled Assets Relief Program, <a goog_docs_charindex=\"6066\" href=\"http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/congress/2010/October2010_Quarterly_Report_to_Congress.pdf\">Quarterly report to Congress</a>, Oct. 26, 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6111\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6112\" />\r\n\tFinancialstability.gov, <a goog_docs_charindex=\"6137\" href=\"http://www.financialstability.gov/docs/Sept%20MHA%20Public%202010.pdf\">&quot;Making Home Affordable Program,&quot;</a> September 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6187\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6188\" />\r\n\tCanfield &amp; Associates, <a goog_docs_charindex=\"6212\" href=\"http://www.gsereport.com/2010/Sept%2015-October%2019.pdf\">GSE Report</a>, Oct. 18, 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6239\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6240\" />\r\n\tInterview, Marco Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos, Oct. 27, 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6309\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6310\" />\r\n\tInterview, U.S. Department of Treasury spokesman Matthew Anderson, Oct. 27, 2010<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6391\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"6392\" />\r\n\tInterview, Special Inspector General of TARP spokeswoman Kris Belisle, Oct. 27, 2010</p>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"6478\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5732\" />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 36, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Marco", "half_true_count": 33, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 277, "last_name": "Rubio", "mostly_true_count": 38, "name_slug": "marco-rubio", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Marco_Rubio.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/277/", "total_count": 169, "true_count": 20, "website": "http://www.rubio.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tOf the more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications, over half have defaulted.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"90\" />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate", "statement_date": "2010-10-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 106, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/106/", "subject": "Housing", "subject_slug": "housing", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
