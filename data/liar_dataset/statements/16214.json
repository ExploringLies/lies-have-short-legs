It was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

And this was in Hagerstown, Maryland. And I don&#39;t quite understand how they can do that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones asks: &quot;What were you seeing?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin responds: &quot;Well, I&#39;m blind so I didn&#39;t see it. I could hear them saying, &lsquo;Um, you know, Oh! You voted yesterday but you can go ahead and recast your vote again today.&#39; I mean, it&#39;s insane, and I wish I could have pulled my phone out or recorder at the time and gotten this on audio or something.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones then asserts, without offering evidence, that Democrats in Maryland, Texas and &quot;all over&quot; have been busted for doing the same type of thing, adding, &quot;And it&#39;s always Democrats because they have no morals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones does not ask, and the caller does not say, if there was any indication that the person trying to vote again was a Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Somebody&#39;s making a joke, I&#39;m guessing,&quot; Donna Duncan, assistant deputy for election policy at the Maryland State Board of Elections, told PolitiFact in a phone interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said that early voting is done through the electronic voter registration database and anyone who tried to vote twice would be immediately flagged. Their only other option, if they insisted that they hadn&#39;t voted yet, would be to cast a provisional ballot, which would be investigated by election officials and never counted if it was confirmed that the person had already voted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duncan said she was unaware of any specific complaints of double voting in the Nov 6 election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, InfoWars is alleging voting fraud by Democrats in Maryland based on the claim of a single anonymous caller who says he overheard a comment that was casually made in public under circumstances that, even if accurately interpreted, don&#39;t implicate any particular political party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the claim is absent of real evidence, we rate it Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-08T12:21:08.404107", "ruling_date": "2018-11-08T14:15:30", "ruling_headline": "Online claim of double voting in Maryland lacks evidence", "ruling_headline_slug": "online-claim-double-voting-maryland-lacks-evidence", "ruling_link_text": "Claim based on single, anonymous caller", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/election-fraud-democrats-are-voting-twice-in-maryland/\">Election fraud: Democrats are voting twice in Maryland</a>,&quot; InfoWars, Nov. 5, 2018, accessed Nov. 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Donna Duncan, assistant deputy for election policy at the Maryland State Board of Elections, Nov. 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": " ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 3978, "last_name": "Infowars", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "infowars", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Infowars.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3978/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Election fraud: Democrats are voting twice in Maryland&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a post on Facebook", "statement_date": "2018-11-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
