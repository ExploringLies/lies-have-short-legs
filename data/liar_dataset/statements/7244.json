State financing per URI student has fallen by an inflation-adjusted 47 percent since 2002, one national report said last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Sen. Dawson T. Hodgson, R-North Kingstown, raised the issue in a Jan. 3, 2012, radio interview on WPRO-AM.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHodgson talked about the state budget as more than a financial document, but, rather, as a statement of values and priorities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that vein, he noted, &quot;the amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe hit the books to see whether the legislature-URI comparison passes the test.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Hodgson, who said he would supply figu res the next day. In the meantime, we checked with Robert A. Weygand, URI&#39;s vice president of administration and finance, who walked us through university budget documents showing that the <a href=\"http://www.uri.edu/budget/assets/URI%20FY14%20Req%20&amp;%20FY15%20Prelim%20Req%20-%20OHE%20File.pdf\">state contributed $58.1 million for URI operations this fiscal year.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWeygand said that if you factor in state contributions used to pay debt on voter-approved bonds for some university buildings -- money URI doesn&rsquo;t see for yearly operations -- the total state contribution would be about $77.3 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Budget Officer Thomas Mullaney told us the part-time legislature was budgeted to receive $37.2 million in state funding this year. Adding in federal funds brings that to $38.8 million. And money not spent last year brings this year&rsquo;s total budget to about $40.4 million, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state funding pays for day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives and Senate, mostly for salaries for staff such as legislative pages and researchers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we heard from Hodgson by e-mail, he provided figures showing the same $58.1-million that Weygand cited for the state&rsquo;s contribution to URI and $38.8 million for the legislature.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAny way you crunch the numbers, the state&rsquo;s contribution to URI is still many millions of dollars more than what it is for the legislature, not nearly the same, as Hodgson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHodgson said the context for his statement on the radio is important, noting that the state&rsquo;s contribution to URI amounts to little more than 8 percent of the university&rsquo;s $706-million budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I believe that investing in public higher education must be a priority for sustained economic growth, and I am not satisfied with the value we are getting for our money from our part-time legislature,&quot; Hodgson said by e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDawson Hodgson said, &quot;The amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, the state contributes $58 million to URI, roughly $20 million more than the legislature&rsquo;s budget. That&rsquo;s not &quot;nearly as much.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether Hodgson&rsquo;s point about budget priorities is valid or not, he got the numbers wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">&nbsp;False</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-11T16:31:56.125813", "ruling_date": "2013-01-13T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Rhode Island Sen.
