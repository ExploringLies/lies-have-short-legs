Rick Perry was asked to account for a loan program he oversaw as the state&rsquo;s agriculture commissioner, the elected post he held from 1991 through 1998.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeil Cavuto of Fox News noted that Perry wants Congress to stop spending so much.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;But as Texas agriculture commissioner, you oversaw a loan guarantee program that, as the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> reported at the time, had so many defaults that the state had to stop guaranteeing bank loans to start-ups in the agribusiness, and eventually bailed out the program with the taxpayer money,&quot; Cavuto said. &quot;So aren&#39;t you guilty of the same behavior you rail against as a presidential candidate?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry replied: &quot;Number one, don&#39;t believe everything you read in the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>. And the second side of it is, we had that program put in place, and the state did not bail (it) out; those programs worked as they were supposed to work. Just like in any bank or any business, you are going to have some that fail.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo bailout?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs agriculture commissioner, Perry oversaw the <a href=\"http://www.texasagriculture.gov/GrantsServices/RuralEconomicDevelopment/TexasAgriculturalFinanceAuthority.aspx\">Texas Agricultural Finance Authority</a>, which was created in 1987. The authority was launched to boost the agricultural economy by selling state-backed bonds to guarantee bank loans to entrepreneurs who could not get commercial loans. The goal was to create small businesses and jobs by processing &mdash; rather than simply growing &mdash; Texas agricultural products.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA revamped version continues today. The authority&rsquo;s Agricultural Loan Guarantee program provides loan guarantees to lenders for eligible applicants who wish to establish or enhance their farm and/or ranch operation or an agriculture-related business. <a href=\"http://www.texasagriculture.gov/Portals/0/forms/RED/TAFA_ALG_1_pager.pdf\">According to the Texas Department of Agriculture</a>, applicants may seek a loan of any amount from their local lender, but the guarantee may not exceed $750,000 or 70 percent of the loan amount, whichever is less. Other offerings include a young farmer grant and interest-rate reduction programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom 1997 through 1999, the Texas state auditor alerted officials to problems in the program, with the problems growing each successive year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResponding to the first hint of problems, Perry said the program was positioned to thrive. In a Jan. 15, 1998, guest column in the <em>Amarillo Daily News</em>, Perry said the program was &quot;on solid footing with a positive balance projected by 2010.&quot; He noted too that the loans were funded by debt &mdash; commercial paper: &quot;No taxpayer money has ever been used to make TAFA loans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn May 1999, though, the auditor&rsquo;s office <a href=\"http://www.sao.state.tx.us/Reports/report.cfm/report/99-034\">warned </a>that if the program&rsquo;s loan-guarantee program did &quot;not improve its financial position, appropriations may be required in the future to meet its general obligation debt.&quot; The auditor said the loan-guarantee program had a &quot;negative fund equity&quot; of $6.9 million through August 1998 because 22 of 83 loans had defaulted since 1993. &quot;An additional $4.5 million, associated with loans currently in default, may have to be written off,&quot; the auditor said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Because it provides loans that otherwise would not be made, the authority has had difficulty attracting good loans to act as a buffer against its riskier loans,&quot; the auditor said. &quot;A certain volume of good loans is needed to ensure that losses are offset and that the programs are self-sustaining; however, the authority has not yet developed financial projections to identify that volume.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs bad debt accumulated, the agency in 2002 put a moratorium on new loans in five of eight TAFA programs. As of the end of August 2008, the agency later reported, TAFA had $25 million in outstanding debt with only $6.4 million in loans and $4.1 million in cash available to service the debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, the agency asked the Texas Legislature to pay off the loan guarantees with a $14.7 million appropriation. An April 24, 2009, <em>Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/content/region/legislature/stories/04/24/0424loans.html\">news article</a> says the authority&rsquo;s bad loans had been pronounced uncollectable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples told the newspaper in an interview that the authority had distributed about $82 million in loans through the program&rsquo;s suspension in 2002. Some loans worked out, Staples said, and a study showed the program had created jobs, but Staples acknowledged that the $14.7 million in defaults -- about 18 percent of the total amount lent -- represented a dismal track record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s bad,&quot; Staples said. &quot;Unfortunately, taxpayers are on the hook for something that happened as long ago as 1987.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to records, the authority&rsquo;s first bad loans were written off in August 1995. Twenty-nine of 102 guaranteed loans defaulted, almost all of them during Perry&#39;s tenure, according to the records, which were provided to the Statesman by the agriculture department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs governor, Perry signed the program&rsquo;s infusion of aid into law by approving the 2010-11 <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Bill_81/6_FSU/Bill-81-6_FSU_0909.pdf\">state budget</a> sent to him by lawmakers. A provision specifies that $14.7 million is appropriated to &quot;retire the debt of the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority,&quot; which was <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=81R&amp;Bill=SB1016\">restructured</a> by a separate measure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Perry&rsquo;s campaign about his no-bailout debate statement and didn&rsquo;t hear back. Asked to describe the 2009 spending, Bryan Black, a spokesman for the agriculture department, called the action a &quot;one-time state appropriation to pay off the debt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur sense? Taxpayers picked up built-up costs that otherwise could not be covered. It seems reasonable to call that expenditure a bailout.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurther, Perry&rsquo;s contention there was no bailout runs counter to his signing the spending into law -- making his debate claim ridiculous.
