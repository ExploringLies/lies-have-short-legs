That&rsquo;s because testing fees were paid by the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the more than 64,000 juniors comprised a unique group in terms of Wisconsin students who have taken the ACT over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, when state rankings on the ACT are done, the scores are for graduating seniors -- and include students from private as well as public high schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to the scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ACT -- which tests in English, reading, writing, math and science -- is scored on a scale of 1 to 36.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s composite score for the public school 11th-graders for 2014-&rsquo;15 was 20, according to the department&rsquo;s news release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the way to think about that score is a baseline. There won&rsquo;t be a score to compare it to until the next set of public school 11th-graders takes the test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the composite for the more than 46,000 graduating seniors -- the group whose scores are traditionally used to rank the states -- was higher: 22.2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The department made a point to state that comparisons between the two scores -- given that they are for two different groups of students -- are &quot;invalid and flawed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s what the Democratic Party did in its news release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The party took the 20 score for Wisconsin&rsquo;s juniors and plugged it into the ACT database that compares state scores for graduating seniors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.act.org/newsroom/data/2015/states.html\">That database</a> clearly shows that Wisconsin&rsquo;s score for the traditional group, the graduating seniors in 2014-&rsquo;15, was 22.2 (<a href=\"http://www.act.org/newsroom/data/2014/states.html\">the same score</a> as the previous year).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new score put Wisconsin, once again, second among states where more than half of the graduating seniors took the ACT -- behind Minnesota, which had a score of 22.7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among all states, Wisconsin&rsquo;s 22.2 ranked 18th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Democratic Party, using the 20 score for the group of juniors, said that score meant Wisconsin tied with Kentucky for 41st place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for the ACT told us the party&rsquo;s claim &quot;cannot be supported&quot; because it is &quot;not an apples to apples comparison.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when we shared that with Brandon Weathersby, spokesman for the Democratic Party, he acknowledged the party had &quot;flubbed&quot; the data. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Democratic Party said Wisconsin dropped &quot;from second in the country to 41st&quot; among states where more than half the students took the ACT college preparation exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The party admits it erred, by comparing scores of two different groups of students. In fact, Wisconsin ranked second in the 2014-&rsquo;15 ACT testing among states where more than half the students took the exam, not 41st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-15T17:14:29.532288", "ruling_date": "2016-01-15T17:03:19", "ruling_headline": "While blaming Scott Walker, Democrats err in saying Wisconsin's ACT rank dropped from 2nd to 41st ", "ruling_headline_slug": "blaming-scott-walker-democrats-say-wisconsins-rank", "ruling_link_text": "A botched comparison", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Democratic Party, <a href=\"http://www.wisdems.org/news/wisconsin-act-scores-plummet\">news release</a>, Jan. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/latest-wisconsin-test-performance-512-proficient-in-reading-437-in-math-b99649565z1-365139221.html\">&quot;Latest Wisconsin test performance: 51% proficient in reading, 44% in math,&quot;</a> Jan. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesman Brandon Weathersby, Jan. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/12/scott-walker/citing-collective-bargaining-law-scott-walker-says/\">&quot;Citing collective bargaining law, Scott Walker says Wisconsin&rsquo;s rank on ACT test has risen to second (Mostly False),&quot;</a> June 12, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction officials John Johnson and Thomas McCarthy, Jan. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, Badger Exam <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/badger01.13.16.pdf\">news release</a>, Jan. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, ACT <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/act01.13.16.pdf\">news release</a>, Jan. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, ACT senior media and public relations director Ed Colby, Jan. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin State Journal, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/local_schools/state-releases-results-from-badger-exam-the-one-off-standardized/article_e20fe836-b11e-5886-b799-b9b5d72d4deb.html\">&quot;State releases result from Badger Exam, the one-off standardized test that is already history,&quot;</a> Jan. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACT, <a href=\"https://www.act.org/newsroom/data/2015/states.html\">2015 ACT average scores by state</a>, accessed Jan. 15, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 841, "last_name": "Democratic Party of Wisconsin", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "state-democratic-party-wisconsin", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Dem-donkey.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/841/", "total_count": 25, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.wisdems.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Wisconsin dropped &quot;from second in the country to 41st&quot; among states where more than half the students took the ACT exam.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news release", "statement_date": "2016-01-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
