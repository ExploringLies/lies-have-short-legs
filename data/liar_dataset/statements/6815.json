In the state House, Hasner earned between $29,328 and $31,932 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen state workers get raises, legislators get <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/11.13\">automatic salary adjustments</a> in July of the following year unless they pass a bill to prevent the raise. Both situations occurred during Hasner&rsquo;s tenure: He got raises some years, and other years members prevented the raises or even took a cut as a symbolic gesture to voters amid an economic downturn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrankel points to votes for pay raises Hasner took in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll four votes were appropriations bills that legislators must pass to pay for state workers&rsquo; salaries and expenses to keep government functioning -- they were not stand-alone votes on pay raises. We confirmed these votes, and found that the appropriations bills passed the House with wide margins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe agree with the first three votes cited by Frankel -- Hasner voted in favor of appropriations bills in 2003, 2005 and 2006 that led to salary raises between 2 and 3.6 percent for legislators.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the fourth vote -- the one in 2010 -- comes with a major caveat: lawmakers accidentally gave themselves a pay raise when they meant to take a pay cut, blaming it on a &quot;drafting error,&quot; according to the <em>Florida Times-Union</em>. The article stated that Hasner, the majority leader, promised to fix the bill in negotiations with the Senate. Ultimately their salaries remained the same as the previous year: $29,697<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislators voted for pay cuts in 2008 and 2009 that took effect that same year. Hasner also had a few years where his salary remained flat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner claimed <a href=\"http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/palm/blog/2008/08/hasner_airs_first_tv_aid_claim.html\">credit</a> for the pay cut in 2008. The <em>Sun-Sentinel </em>wrote that the pay cut was proposed by state Rep. Ron Saunders, D-Key West, in a meeting and then by state Rep. Juan Zapata, R-Miami, on the House floor. Hasner, the House majority leader, told the Sentinel that he worked behind the scenes to get the pay cut:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Just because Juan Zapata was the name behind the amendment doesn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t a catalyst behind the idea. Leadership is more than just putting your name on something.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner gave PolitiFact a similar account: &quot;You don&rsquo;t put your name on every amendment when you are majority leader. ... I led the effort to cut my pay in the state Legislature when things got tough.&quot; (He reiterated that he led the pay cut effort in a September <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0FgGg2Ft2o\">speech</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOverall, Hasner entered the House in 2003 making $29,328. His pay peaked in 2007 at $31,932. He left the House in 2010 making $29,697.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> </strong><strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrankel&rsquo;s ad says Hasner said &quot;I&#39;ll never accept a pay increase,&quot; but he &quot;voted to raise his pay four times.&quot; We have several criticisms of this claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor starters, Frankel didn&rsquo;t make it clear that Hasner said he would never accept a pay increase if elected to Congress -- it&#39;s possible to view the ad and falsely think he said that while accepting pay raises in the state House. There is a significant difference between saying that he would freeze his own congressional pay at around $174,000 and voting for overall budget bills that included measly pay raises in the state House that took his pay from $29,328 to $31,932 (and then back down again).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, Frankel omits that Hasner&rsquo;s pay was frozen or cut for a few of his years in the House. And for one of those votes he did vote for a pay raise, but then House members said that was an accident, and they ultimately didn&rsquo;t get a raise. Yes, Frankel says that he &quot;voted&quot; for the pay raises -- not that he &quot;received&quot; them. Right away Hasner said that was a mistake and would be fixed, and it was.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is a small kernel of truth here: Hasner did vote for three overall budgets that allowed himself to get a small pay raise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-02T14:21:15.999937", "ruling_date": "2012-10-03T10:50:43", "ruling_headline": "Lois Frankel says Adam Hasner promised \"I'll never accept a pay increase,\u201d but he \u201cvoted to raise his pay four times.\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "frankel-says-hasner-promised-ill-never-accept-pay-", "ruling_link_text": "Mixing up federal and state pay", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tLois Frankel campaign, <a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/neveronyourside?refcode=fp_rotator_real\">TV ad &quot;Real,&quot;
