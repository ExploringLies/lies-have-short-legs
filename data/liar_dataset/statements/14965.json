Jerry Brown reeled off statistics on California&rsquo;s prison spending during his final State of the State Address after a total of 16 years as governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, who has followed a federal court order to reduce the state&rsquo;s prison overcrowding, warned legislators at the state Capitol not to simply pass more crime laws but instead consider a holistic approach to criminal justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He suggested California has gone too far on prison spending since 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The corrections budget then was about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it&rsquo;s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion,&quot; Brown said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was the governor right? Has California&rsquo;s prison spending nearly tripled as a share of the state&rsquo;s general fund budget since 1970?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set out on a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/stateofcaliforni7071unse#page/n13/mode/2up/search/corrections+department\">1970-71 fiscal year budget</a>, produced under then Gov. Ronald Reagan, backs up the first part of Brown&rsquo;s claim. It lists the corrections department as 2.8 percent, or nearly $40 million, of the state&rsquo;s $1.4 billion general fund budget that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/10025639/screen%20shot%20prison%20spending.JPG\" style=\"height:738px; width:1166px\" /><em>California&#39;s 1970-71 fiscal year budget.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s 2018-19 budget proposal, meanwhile, also supports the claim. It shows the state expects to spend 9 percent, or nearly $12 billion, of its $132 billion general fund on the corrections department. That&rsquo;s up about $1 billion from prison spending two years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/franklin-zimring/\">Franklin Zimring</a>, a UC Berkeley criminal justice professor, called Brown&rsquo;s claim about the increased share of prison spending &quot;absolutely true.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;California&rsquo;s prison population exploded from 1980 through the late 1990s and prison building metastasized in the state,&quot; Zimring said. &quot;We went from a little over 24,000 prisoners in California prisons to over 170,000 prisoners in 2010 and 2011.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zimring attributed the increase to the state&rsquo;s booming population during that period, tough sentencing laws, particularly 1994&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/20142.htm\">Three Strikes</a> law, and the national focus on drug crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fewer inmates, higher costs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>California has sharply cut its prison population following a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. The population reached a peak of <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-changing-prison-population/\">163,000 inmates</a> in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as the inmate numbers have dropped, state corrections spending has continued to rise. That&rsquo;s, in part, because California has the highest per capita inmate cost in the nation, at an estimated $80,000 annually for 2018-19, as we examined in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/jan/17/delaine-eastin/does-california-rank-41st-student-spending-no-1-pr/\">recent fact check</a>. There&rsquo;s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate numbers have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. At the same time, prison staffing costs have increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent&quot; level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed California&rsquo;s corrections budget in 1970 was &quot;about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it&rsquo;s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/stateofcaliforni7071unse#page/n13/mode/2up/search/corrections+department\">1970-71 fiscal year budget</a> supports the first part of Brown&rsquo;s claim, listing prison system spending as 2.8 percent of that year&rsquo;s general fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s budget proposal for this fiscal year, meanwhile, shows the corrections department is now estimated to be 9 percent of the general fund, or $12 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A UC Berkeley criminal justice professor told us the governor&rsquo;s spending claim rings true, noting the state&rsquo;s prison population exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, driven by the state&rsquo;s overall population boom, strict criminal sentencing laws and a national focus on drug crimes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor&rsquo;s numbers are on the mark and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing from his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Brown&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/nov/01/principles-politifact-punditfact-and-truth-o-meter/\">more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-25T20:38:50.463561", "ruling_date": "2018-01-25T17:57:45", "ruling_headline": "Has the rate of California\u2019s prison spending nearly tripled since 1970?
