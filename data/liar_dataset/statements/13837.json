Bill Nelson, D-Fla., for being inconsistent on the use of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>America Rising Squared, the policy arm of the conservative America Rising PAC, said in an <a href=\"http://arsquared.org/flip-flop-fact-check-sen-nelsons-filibuster-falsehood/\">online post</a> that Nelson, up for re-election in 2018, committed a &quot;filibuster flip-flop&quot; on President Donald Trump&nbsp;nominee Neil Gorsuch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 2006, Nelson opposed the use of a filibuster for the nomination of Justice (Samuel) Alito, but now has adopted a different stance,&quot; said America Rising Squared, a group <a href=\"http://arsquared.org/scotus/\">advocating for senators to support Gorsuch</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to look at whether Nelson flip-flopped on using the filibuster for a Supreme Court nominee on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has been consistent on an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts told us America Rising mischaracterized Nelson&rsquo;s record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Samuel Alito and the filibuster process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As proof of its claim, America Rising Squared <a href=\"http://arsquared.org/flip-flop-fact-check-sen-nelsons-filibuster-falsehood/\">points</a> to Nelson&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/politics/politicsspecial1/senate-roll-call-on-alito-filibuster.html\">votes</a> in January 2006 on the nomination of Alito, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to succeed retiring Justice Sandra Day O&#39;Connor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats fought against Alito&rsquo;s nomination mainly due to his criticism of<em> Roe vs. Wade</em>, the decision that legalized abortion nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the weeks leading up to the vote, Democrats, including leaders Harry Reid and Charles Schumer <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/19/nation/na-alito19\">showed little interest </a>in using the filibuster to block his nomination. (Reid and Schumer would ultimately go along with the filibuster.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/03/6-questions-answered-about-nuclear-option-filibust/\">Senate rules</a>, a minority of senators -- even just one -- can filibuster, or hold up, a Supreme Court nomination, effectively requiring 60 votes for a motion to end debate and move on to the nomination itself. When the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/22/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-changes-views-how-quickly-act-suprem/\">minority party filibusters an initiative</a>, as many Democrats have pledged to do with the Gorsuch nomination, the majority party can force a vote through a procedure called cloture. This effectively ends the filibuster by limiting the debate to 30 more hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Days before the vote on Alito, Reid said, &quot;Everyone knows there is not enough votes to support a filibuster.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Massachusetts Democrats John Kerry and Ted Kennedy led a filibuster effort anyway, drawing interest from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as they contemplated a presidential bid. But the <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/31/nation/na-alito31\">effort failed</a>, as almost half of the Senate&#39;s Democrats &mdash; including Nelson &mdash; voted against it on Jan. 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no statements by Nelson at the time about his opinion on the use of the filibuster, but he didn&rsquo;t go along with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate voted <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00001\">72-25 </a>to end debate on Alito&#39;s Supreme Court nomination. A &quot;yes&quot; vote was a vote to end debate, while a &quot;no&quot; vote was a vote to filibuster Alito&rsquo;s nomination. Nelson was one of 19 Democrats and 53 Republicans to vote &quot;yes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, the Senate held an up-or-down vote on Alito&rsquo;s nomination. Nelson was one of 42 senators to<a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00002\"> vote against Alito </a>while 58 voted in favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson told reporters that he viewed Alito as being against the &quot;little guy&quot; in the face of big corporations and government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nelson&rsquo;s statements about Gorsuch process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the Republicans currently hold <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/history/partydiv.htm\">52 Senate seats</a>, it means the GOP needs eight Democrats to schedule a final vote on Gorsuch, assuming no Republican defections. (Then the nomination itself needs only 51 votes to pass.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will likely be difficult for Republicans to sway eight Democrats, so it&rsquo;s possible that the GOP will use the &quot;nuclear option.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination, Nelson&rsquo;s spokesman Ryan Brown pointed to Nelson&rsquo;s interview with the <em><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/right-and-left-pressure-florida-sen-bill-nelson-to-support-gorsuch-for/2312558\">Tampa Bay Times</a></em> in February. (The <em>Times</em> is PolitiFact&rsquo;s parent company.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson told the <em>Times </em>he stands with Democrats in insisting on a 60-vote threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You bet I do. The filibuster has always forced the political extremes to come of the middle to build consensus,&quot; Nelson said, adding it was a &quot;mistake&quot; for Reid to lower the threshold on other nominees that were stymied by Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown told PolitiFact Florida that Nelson doesn&rsquo;t support the &quot;nuclear option,&quot; a procedural shortcut known as the &quot;nuclear option&quot; that would enable Senate Republicans to sidestep the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In 2006, Nelson voted for cloture - that doesn&rsquo;t mean he supports changing the Senate rules,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Just because you vote for cloture, doesn&rsquo;t mean you support the so-called &lsquo;nuclear option.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/03/6-questions-answered-about-nuclear-option-filibust/\">See our explainer on the &quot;nuclear option&quot;</a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked three political science professors to review America Rising&rsquo;s argument against Nelson&rsquo;s actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three said they saw no inconsistencies in Nelson&rsquo;s actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is a huge difference between voting for cloture in 2006 (utilizing a process in the existing rules) and not wanting to see the Senate change its rules in 2017,&quot; said Gregory Koger at the University of Miami. &quot;Indeed, there is a high level of consistency between these actions: Both affirm the use of the existing cloture rule to address filibusters against Supreme Court nominations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political science professor, said that favoring the 60-vote threshold is not inconsistent with voting for or against cloture or the confirmation in any particular case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In this case, a senator has a point of view about the best rules for the Senate and, under those rules, exercises his judgment in different ways on different issues,&quot; Smith said. &quot;There is nothing inconsistent about that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Alito&rsquo;s case, Nelson wanted the Senate to vote on the nomination even though he opposed Alito, said Burdett Loomis at the University of Kansas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now he says he supports 60 votes (to overcome a filibuster) to bring Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination forward,&quot; Loomis said. &quot;This is exactly what he did with Alito, even though he might well vote differently in this instance. And this has nothing to do with the nuclear option.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One final point: Nelson&rsquo;s stance related to the process of Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination isn&rsquo;t complete. Nelson, who <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/sen-nelson-to-meet-today-with-trumps-scotus-pick-neil-gorsuch/2315606\">met</a> with Gorsuch on March 7, has &quot;not yet decided how he will vote on cloture or confirmation,&quot; Brown told PolitiFact Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson did not join a failed effort by some of his Democratic nominees to filibuster Alito&rsquo;s nomination in 2006. He voted to end debate and then voted against Alito&rsquo;s nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gorsuch&rsquo;s nomination hasn&rsquo;t reached a vote yet, and Nelson hasn&rsquo;t said how he will ultimately vote on cloture or confirmation. But he has said he stands by the 60-vote threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson made No Flip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-09T12:20:18.865931", "ruling_date": "2017-03-09T14:51:38", "ruling_headline": "Did Sen.
