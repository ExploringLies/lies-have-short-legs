That&#39;s a fact!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDemocrats in individual states, and nationally, have sought to discredit voter-identification initiatives, &nbsp;charging they are part of a Republican strategy to make it harder for people who have historically favored Democrats to get the paperwork they need.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Coulter&rsquo;s counterpunch showed, Rhode Island&rsquo;s voter identification law, passed last year, &nbsp;has emerged as a Republican talking point to dispute accusations of partisanship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this item, we will check Coulter&rsquo;s claim that Rhode Island was a leader in voter-identification legislation. We will examine the second part of her statement in a separate item.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRhode Island, &nbsp;where 83.5 percent of the state&rsquo;s legislators are Democrats, is an exception to the national trend on voter-identification, but, despite what Coulter claimed, it is far from being &quot;one of the first&quot; states to pass such legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of Sept. 5, &nbsp;2012, &nbsp;31 states had enacted some form of voter identification law. At least 12 did so between 2003-2010, well before Governor Lincoln Chafee signed Rhode Island&rsquo;s law in July 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich state actually was the first is unclear. For the modern era, it appears the first state to require voters to verify their identity appears to be South Carolina, in 1950, said Jennie Bower, a senior fellow who researches the issue for the council. Rhode Island isn&rsquo;t even the first state in New England to require identification; Connecticut did it in 1993.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnn Coulter said Rhode Island was one of the first states to enact voter-identification laws. It isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;At least a dozen states had such laws earlier, making Rhode Island closer to the middle of the pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rule her statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-02T17:44:09.294384", "ruling_date": "2012-10-03T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Ann Coulter says Rhode Island was one of first states to pass Voter ID law", "ruling_headline_slug": "ann-coulter-says-rhode-island-was-one-first-states", "ruling_link_text": "What about the two dozen states before Rhode Island?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The View,<a href=\"http://nation.foxnews.com/ann-coulter/2012/09/27/ann-coulter-causes-mass-hysteria-view-whoopi-bleeped\">&quot;Ann Coulter causes mass hysteria on &lsquo;The View,&rsquo; Whoopi bleeped...&quot; </a>Sept. 27, 2012, accessed Oct. 2, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNational Conference of State Legislatures, <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx#State_Reqs\">&quot;Voter Identification Requirements,&quot; </a>accessed Oct. 2, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterview: Jennie Bower, senior fellow, National Council of State Legislatures, Oct. 1, 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRhode Island General Laws, <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/title17/17-19/17-19-24.2.htm\">&quot;Conduct of Election and Voting Equipment, and Supplies,&quot; &nbsp;</a>17-19-24.2<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Providence Journal, &quot;Voter-ID measure had broad backing; Bills similar to the one signed by Governor Chafee opposed by minorities, Democrats elsewhere,&quot; July 7, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Columnist and author", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Ann", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "New York", "id": 183, "last_name": "Coulter", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "ann-coulter", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/anncoulter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/183/", "total_count": 16, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.anncoulter.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;One of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV show appearance", "statement_date": "2012-09-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
