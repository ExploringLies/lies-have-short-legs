He&rsquo;s made the accusation several times so far during the 2016 presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he also said it when his reality TV show The Apprentice didn&rsquo;t win an Emmy in 2012, 2013 or 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was even a time when he didn&#39;t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged,&quot; Clinton said Oct. 19 at the third and final presidential debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to examine Trump&rsquo;s Twitter feed to see what he had to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of the Emmys, Trump clearly does a lot of whining about not winning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/329060403051102208\">April 29, 2013</a>: </strong>&quot;I should have many Emmys for The Apprentice if the process were fair-in any event, it&#39;s not my day job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/250313493197238272\">Sept. 24, 2012</a>: </strong>&quot; &#39;Amazing Race&#39; winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility -- no wonder the ratings are at record lows.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sept. 22, 2013: </strong>&quot;The Emmys are soooooo boring! Terrible show. I&#39;m going to watch football! I already know the winners. Good night.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/440319739429015552\">March 2, 2014</a>: </strong>&quot;Which is worse and which is more dishonest - the #Oscars or the Emmys?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sept. 24, 2012: </strong>&quot;The Emmys are all politics, that&#39;s why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/290905304227520512\">Jan. 14, 2013</a>: </strong>&quot;According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sept. 22, 2013: &nbsp;&quot;#CelebApprentice should be part of the Emmys nominations! Pure politics!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of angst. But Trump never directly says the Emmys process is rigged in the way he has characterized&nbsp;the U.S. election system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, Trump is complaining that politics plays a role in deciding who wins, which is not a particularly surprising assertion when it comes to the selections made by award shows, or by voters trying to decide whom to pick for United States president for that matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;There was even a time when (Donald Trump) didn&#39;t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump never directly makes that accusation. He calls the system unfair and political, but he doesn&rsquo;t go as far as to allege that the process is being rigged or tampered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Clinton&#39;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b1d7f48-b399-4796-980c-d228a6cb2dca\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b1d7f48-b399-4796-980c-d228a6cb2dca</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-20T01:04:28.589538", "ruling_date": "2016-10-20T01:32:27", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump claimed the Emmys were rigged", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-claims-emmys-wer", "ruling_link_text": "Whining, but not saying rigged", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>The Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/19/the-final-trump-clinton-debate-transcript-annotated/\">The final Trump-Clinton debate transcript, annotated</a>,&quot; Oct. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Josh Schwerin, spokesman, Hillary Clinton campaign, Oct. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AmericaBlog.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://americablog.com/2016/10/trump-said-election-rigged-didnt-win-emmy.html\">Trump says the election was rigged . . . when he didn&#39;t win an Emmy</a>,&quot; Oct. 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PoliticsUSA, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politicususa.com/2016/10/17/donald-trump-whined-emmys-rigged-years-row.html\">Donald Trump Whined the Emmys Were Rigged Too &mdash; Three Years in a Row</a>,&quot; Oct. 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emmys.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.emmys.com/news/awards-news/infographic-how-emmy-won\">Infographic: How an Emmy is Won</a>,&quot; Aug. 2, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;There was even a time when (Donald Trump) didn&#39;t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the third 2016 presidential debate", "statement_date": "2016-10-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 52, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/52/", "subject": "Pop Culture", "subject_slug": "pop-culture", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ".@HillaryClinton says @realDonaldTrump complained that the Emmys are rigged as well.
