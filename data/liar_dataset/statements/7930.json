The agency has a <u><a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fraud.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">website</a></u> to solicit food-stamp fraud tips.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;While administrators work to reduce payment errors,&quot; the story said, &quot;the USDA is collaborating with state agencies to investigate recipients suspected of committing fraud or misusing benefits. It also will seek tougher penalties for stores engaged in trafficking. Trafficking generally takes the form of users &lsquo;selling&rsquo; their benefits for roughly 50 cents on the dollar to brick-and-mortar retailers or to individuals found via websites like eBay or Facebook.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Basis of claim</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGallego&rsquo;s claim did not speak directly to trafficking scams. But are 97 percent of food stamp benefits paid in proper amounts to eligible residents, as he said?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, Gallego spokeswoman Rebecca Acu&ntilde;a attributed the percentage to research by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. In a <u><a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3965\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-517c58dc-679a-101a-b69a-de765c28ee72\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">blog post</a></u> revised May 16, 2013, the center said the House committee-approved version of the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, which Gallego and committee members were discussing when he spoke, would cut SNAP by almost $21 billion over the next decade, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, mostly working families with children and senior citizens.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe center said in a May 10, 2013, <u><a href=\"http://www.offthechartsblog.org/the-facts-on-snap-part-3-snap-is-efficient/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">blog post</a></u>: &quot;Only 3 percent of SNAP benefits represent overpayments, meaning they either went to ineligible households or went to eligible households but in excessive amounts. SNAP achieved its lowest error rate on record in fiscal year 2011, with a national overpayment rate of just 2.99 percent (see graph). The underpayment rate that year was 0.81 percent. Thus, the net loss to the federal government &mdash; the amounts lost through over&shy;payments minus those saved by underpayments &mdash; was only 2.2 percent.&quot; An accompanying graph, which we show below, was headlined: &quot;SNAP Error Rates Are at an All-Time Low.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, the center said, relatively &quot;few payment errors reflect dishonesty or fraud. The overwhelming majority result from honest mistakes by recipients, eligibility workers, data entry clerks, or computer programmers. States report that almost 60 percent of the dollar value of overpayments and almost 90 percent of the dollar value of underpayments were their fault, not recipients&rsquo;. Much of the rest of the overpayments resulted from innocent errors by households that had trouble navigating SNAP&rsquo;s complex rules.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Government data</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<u><a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/pdfs/2011-rates.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Information posted online</a></u> by the Agriculture Department tracks with the center&rsquo;s blog post, stating that in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, 2.99 percent of SNAP benefits were overpayments and 0.81 percent were underpayments. Wyoming had the highest share of overpayments that year, at 7.63 percent, and Alaska had the lowest, 0.53 percent, while 2.63 percent of SNAP payments in Texas were overpayments, according to the information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverpayments were more prevalent in previous years, annual department reports indicate, though the incidence dropped each year after <u><a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/pdfs/2006-rates.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">fiscal 2006</a></u>, when overpayments accounted for 4.82 percent of benefits. In <u><a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/pdfs/2000-rates.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">fiscal 2000</a></u>, in contrast, SNAP overpayments accounted for 6.51 percent of its benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, Agriculture Department spokeswoman Elena Gaona told us information on overpayments of SNAP benefits in fiscal 2012 are due to be released by the end of June 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>An independent analysis</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeparately, we contacted Kay Brown, an analyst who has studied the food stamp program for the General Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Brown said by telephone that she has &quot;no problem&quot; with Gallego&rsquo;s wording in that the government does assess whether the proper amounts are paid to eligible recipients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown also said told us improper payments caused by participants&rsquo; failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, don&rsquo;t necessarily indicate attempts to cheat, though for a May 5, 2005 GAO <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-05-245\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">report</a>, &quot;we could not determine the percentage of payment errors that involve participants intentionally withholding information.&quot; Nationally in 2003, the report said, &quot;about 5 percent of all payment errors were referred for fraud investigation. Data are not available, however, to determine what percentage of these error cases resulted in disqualifying participants because of fraud.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report said that almost two-thirds of food stamp payment errors were caused by government caseworkers, usually when they failed to keep up with reported changes or make mistakes applying program rules. Some one-third of payment errors were caused by participants&rsquo; failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, the report said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGallego said 97 percent of food stamp benefits &quot;are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe are mindful this claim did not speak to misdeeds that can occur once someone receives food stamps. Setting that aside, nearly 3 percent of such payments were overpayments in fiscal 2011, the latest year of available data, and nearly 1 percent were underpayments, according to the government. That&rsquo;s a total of about 96 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGallego&rsquo;s statement comes close enough.
