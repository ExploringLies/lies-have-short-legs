There are numerous examples to choose from, we'll look at two of his more plain-spoken statements here:\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,\" Romney said in a 1994 debate with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. \"I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years we should sustain and support it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n In a 2002 debate, Romney said there was no difference between his views and that of his Democratic opponent, Shannon P. O'Brien. \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose. I will not change any provisions of Massachusetts pro-choice laws,'' he said.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 2007, Romney says his views have changed. \"And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been pro-life longer than I have,\" he said at a Republican debate on Aug. 5, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n (\n <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/\">\n  Politifact\n </a>\n looked at Romney's abortion record previously; check out that story\n <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/33/\">\n  here\n </a>\n .)\n</p>\n<p>\n The sly TV ad from the Log Cabin Republicans merely states, \"A pro-choice record,\" leaving out a verb like \"has\" or \"had.\" The ad could do a better job at pointing out that Romney no longer stands by his pro-choice record, but it doesn't want to. The whole point is to shine a light on where Romney once stood on abortion. His record on abortion is not entirely pro-choice, given his current position opposing abortion rights. That's why we find this attack Mostly True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:34.868909", "ruling_date": "2007-10-17T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Pro-choice is his record, but not his position", "ruling_headline_slug": "pro-choice-is-his-record-but-not-his-position", "ruling_link_text": "Pro-choice is his record, but not his position", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "The Log Cabin Republicans,\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elx3UWmyAY4\">\n \"Romney's Real Record,\"\n</a>\nOct. 4, 2007.\n<p>\n Massachusetts Telegram and Gazette, \"Debaters brawl on taxes and abortion; Candidates jab, accuse, deride,\" Oct. 30, 2002.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Boston Globe, \"The Kennedy-Romney Debates: Debate Excerpts,\" Oct. 26, 1994.\n</p>\n<p>\n ABC News,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/us/politics/05transcript-debate.html\">\n  Debate Transcript,\n </a>\n Aug. 5, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 28, "last_name": "Log Cabin Republicans", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "log-cabin-republicans", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-logcabinrepublicans_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/28/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "Mitt Romney has \"a pro-choice record.\"", "statement_context": "", "statement_date": "2007-10-19", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 11, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/11/", "subject": "Abortion", "subject_slug": "abortion", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
