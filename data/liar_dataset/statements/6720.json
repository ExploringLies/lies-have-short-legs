The Post article does say it was updated, but refers only to the 13 percent figure, so it&rsquo;s not clear whether 24 percent had been cited previously.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt doesn&rsquo;t really matter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth the <a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/chairmans_mark_fy013.pdf\">Ryan budget</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/32_1.pdf\">Obama budget</a> cited by the Post actually raise -- not cut -- spending on medical, disability, housing and other services for veterans by billions of dollars. It&rsquo;s just that Ryan&rsquo;s budget doesn&rsquo;t increase spending for veterans as much as Obama&rsquo;s does.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, there are fears that Ryan&rsquo;s long-term budget plans -- which largely aim to reduce federal spending -- could necessitate dramatic reductions in services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tZerban&rsquo;s spokesman cited a March 2012 <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3708\">article</a> by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington, D.C. think tank, about the long-term spending &quot;path&quot; traced by Ryan&rsquo;s budget. By 2050, the article claimed, &quot;most of the federal government aside from Social Security, health care and defense&quot; -- including veterans programs -- &quot;would cease to exist.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Zerban didn&rsquo;t say Ryan&rsquo;s plan would someday cause veterans programs to &quot;cease to exist.&quot; What&rsquo;s more, that sweeping prediction is a measure of long-term outcomes, not actions in one-year budget increments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, many budget watchers point out that Ryan&rsquo;s long-term plan lacks enough detail to know where, and to what degree, specific cuts would occur.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an August 2012 <a href=\"http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/mail/send.cfm?articleID=2763\">analysis</a>, University of Maryland public policy professor Philip Joyce said the level of proposed spending cuts &quot;will require the federal government to stop doing lots of things that it does now.&quot; The cuts could be realized through a two-thirds reduction in, for example, doctors and nurses in veterans hospitals, the professor said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Joyce also said the lack of detail on cuts to federal services makes it &quot;impossible to know what the actual impact&quot; of Ryan&rsquo;s long-term budget would be.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimilarly, our friends at FactCheck.org <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/barrett-wants-state-to-turn-over-foreclosure-settlement-money-r96sn10-169968846.html\">observed</a> in August 2012 that &quot;Republicans boast of cutting the deficit more than the president, but don&rsquo;t detail how what programs would have to be eliminated or reduced to achieve that. And the Democrats fill in the details, claiming popular programs like education are on the chopping block.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tZerban said Ryan supports &quot;cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Ryan&rsquo;s short-term budgets provide for spending increases for veterans services. And even if his long-term plans lead to spending reductions, there isn&rsquo;t enough detail to know whether and how much programs for veterans would be trimmed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Zerban&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-17T16:14:18.423434", "ruling_date": "2012-09-23T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Paul Ryan backs cutting veterans funding 24 percent, House opponent Rob Zerban says", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-ryan-backs-cutting-veterans-funding-24-percen", "ruling_link_text": "Ryan budget proposes increase, just not as much as Obama", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube.com, Ed Schultz <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2ewn2jrUsk&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">interview</a> (at 6:00) of Rob Zerban, Aug. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, Rob Zerban campaign communications director Karthik Ganapathy, Sept. 13 and 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Paul Ryan campaign communications director Kevin Seifert, Sept. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/what-paul-ryans-budget-actually-cuts--and-by-how-much/2012/03/20/gIQAL43vPS_blog.html\">&quot;What Paul Ryan&rsquo;s budget actually cuts -- and by how much,&quot;</a> March 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Maryland, <a href=\"http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/mail/send.cfm?articleID=2763\">&quot;Election policy fact check: Ryan budget plan impact,&quot;</a> Aug. 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactCheck.org, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/outdated-attacks-on-ryan/\">&quot;Outdated attacks on Ryan,&quot;</a> Aug. 14, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Rob", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2025, "last_name": "Zerban", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "rob-zerban", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rob_Zerban_PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2025/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. House opponent Paul Ryan supports &quot;cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2012-08-09", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 129, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/129/", "subject": "Disability", "subject_slug": "disability", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
