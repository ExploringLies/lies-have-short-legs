A late endorsement by conservative darling Sarah Palin helped her rocket ahead of opponents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that&#39;s what concerns Melanie Crozier, the director of the Georgia Right to Life&#39;s Political Action Committee, Crozier said in a recent article for Politico, an online news site.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;[Palin] has a son with Down syndrome, and under Karen Handel&rsquo;s laws, Handel would have felt like it was OK to go in and abort that child,&quot; said Crozier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrozier added that they plan to back Nathan Deal, Handel&#39;s opponent in the GOP runoff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did a double take. Handel is fine with aborting a fetus that tests positive for Down syndrome?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo, she&#39;s not, Handel said. Her campaign called Crozier&#39;s statement a &quot;cruel and revolting lie.&quot; She called on Crozier and GRTL President Dan Becker to step down.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe requested to speak with Crozier. <font>Instead, GRTL sent us a press release on their opposition to Handel&#39;s views on in vitro fertilization. </font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Crozier did talk with WSB-TV. In the interview, she apologized for making a statement that was unclear and said she was really criticizing Handel&#39;s views on in vitro fertilization. GRTL thinks doctors should create only as many embryos as they plan to implant. <font>Handel thinks that if any are left over, they should be considered for adoption. &nbsp; </font><br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrozier has not asked for a correction or clarification on the Politico story, according to its author.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGRTL and Handel have tangled before. She, like other GOP candidates, has declared herself &quot;pro-life,&quot; but some claim she&#39;s not &quot;pro-life&quot; enough.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn statewide runs, Handel has consistently opposed abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at stake.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGRTL supports only one exception: the life of the mother.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHandel has taken hits from GRTL for her views for years, but she has stood her ground.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Handel ran for secretary of state in 2006, GRTL sent out a postcard naming her primary runoff opponent as the race&#39;s only true right-to-life candidate. Handel won without the organization&#39;s support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGRTL and Handel were at loggerheads again in June, after Becker used the word &quot;barren&quot; to talk about Handel&#39;s struggles with fertility and her position on abortion. She has previously talked publicly about how she tried unsuccessfully to have a child for 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd when Palin announced her endorsement of Handel on July 12<font>,<font> GRTL issued a press release to say they were &quot;stunned&quot; because Handel&#39;s views on abortion showed she did not cherish the lives of children with genetic disorders as much as she should.&nbsp; &nbsp; </font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalin&#39;s son Trig was born in 2008 with Down syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes physical problems and cognitive delays.<br />\r\n\t<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\tIn a July 22 interview with Lori Geary on WSB-TV, Crozier tried to clarify the statement she made to Politico.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrozier: &quot;What I&rsquo;m saying is, if a baby who is created through the process of in vitro fertilization ...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeary: &quot;Which again, Palin&rsquo;s was not ...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrozier: &quot;But we&rsquo;re saying, if this was the case, and was found to have Down syndrome, Karen Handel is OK with that life being exterminated.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHandel&#39;s campaign denies this claim as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They&#39;re making a series of reaches beyond anything Karen believes,&quot; said her campaign spokesman Dan McLagan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat Crozier told Politico doesn&#39;t stand up to to scrutiny. Neither does her clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGRTL failed to provide any evidence whatsoever for the statement that Handel thinks it is fine to abort a child because it has Down syndrome. And the organization failed to explain how it came to its conclusion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group should have known that they were misrepresenting Handel&#39;s beliefs. They&#39;ve been quibbling with her stances for years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter Handel called for the resignation of GRTL&#39;s leadership, the group backed so far off its statement that Crozier claimed she wasn&#39;t really talking about aborting children with Down syndrome. Instead, she told WSB-TV, she was really talking about in vitro fertilization.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, as Geary pointed out, Trig wasn&#39;t conceived in a test tube. How could the subject apply to him?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCrozier made a baseless and outrageous statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe earns PolitiFact&#39;s lowest rating, Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-23T17:40:13.872540", "ruling_date": "2010-07-26T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Group says GOP candidate Karen Handel would be OK aborting child with Down syndrome", "ruling_headline_slug": "abortion-group-says-gop-gubernatorial-hopeful-kare", "ruling_link_text": "Nope.
