At the start of the year, following the death of Biden&rsquo;s son to brain cancer, the vice president took the lead in the administration&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative\">Cancer Moonshot</a> project, an effort to rapidly accelerate cancer research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruto cast cancer as a top public health priority for his country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cancer and matters to do with kidney failure kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined,&quot; Ruto said Sept. 9, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that AIDS is the No. 1 killer in sub-Saharan Africa, and malaria ranks fourth, our <a href=\"https://africacheck.org/reports/do-cancer-kidney-failure-kill-more-kenyans-than-malaria-tb-aids/\">Africa Check partners</a> decided to check Ruto&rsquo;s numbers. He is wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Ruto&rsquo;s office did not provide any supporting data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A dearth of numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solid data is sorely lacking in Kenya as it is in most sub-Saharan African nations. But the numbers that are available disprove Ruto&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kenya just launched a national cancer registry, but it won&rsquo;t be fully in place until 2019. For the time being, the <a href=\"http://aphrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Steps-Report-NCD-2015.pdf\">highest estimate</a> puts the number of cancer deaths at 28,000 in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On kidney disease, Kenya has no national data at all. The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/index1.html\">World Health Organization</a> estimates 3,100 deaths for 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combined that&rsquo;s a rough count of 31,100 deaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHO is the most reliable source for <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr15_annex02.pdf?ua=1\">tuberculosis death estimates</a> in Kenya as well, with about 9,400 deaths in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United Nations AIDS program relies on statistical models to derive the number of AIDS deaths in Kenya. UNAIDS says it is &quot;logistically impossible and ethically problematic&quot; to investigate all deaths. According to its <a href=\"http://aidsinfo.unaids.org/\">statistical model</a>, there were between 28,000 and 50,000 deaths due to AIDS in Kenya in 2014, with 38,000 being the most likely figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For malaria, the WHO said in its <a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/report/en/\">World Malaria Report for 2015</a> that it was unable to collect data for six East African countries, including Kenya, between 2000 and 2014 because of &quot;inconsistent reporting, or changes in health service accessibility or diagnostic testing&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best we could find for malaria deaths was Kenya&rsquo;s civil registration <a href=\"https://africacheck.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Economic-Survey-2016-1.pdf\">data</a>, which provisionally shows 23,789 deaths in 2013 and 20,691in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, while the numbers are far from perfect, they do not support Ruto&rsquo;s point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This table pulls the numbers together. Even using the lowest estimates for AIDS and malaria deaths, the combined toll is greater than for cancer and kidney disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Cancer/Kidney deaths</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>AIDS/Malaria/TB deaths</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Cancer</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>28,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Kidney disease</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>3,100</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>AIDS</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>28,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Malaria</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>20,691</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>TB</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>9,400</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Totals</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>31,100</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>58,091</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>There are efforts such as the <a href=\"https://africacheck.org/reports/do-cancer-kidney-failure-kill-more-kenyans-than-malaria-tb-aids/\">Health Data Collaborative</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ddcf.org/what-we-fund/african-health-initiative/goals--strategies/phit-data-collaborative/\">African Health Initiative</a> that aim to beef up the health data collected in sub-Saharan Africa.
