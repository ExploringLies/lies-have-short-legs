Spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to Cuccinelli&rsquo;s support of personhood bills in <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?071+ful+HB2797\"><u>2007</u></a> and <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?121+ful+HB1+pdf\"><u>2012</u></a> that would have granted legal rights to human embryos from the moment of conception. Those bills, he said, would have banned all abortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli, as we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/sep/16/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-he-never-backed-legislation-limits/\"><u>noted before</u></a>, did support personhood bills. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean he opposes abortion in every circumstance. Since his <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020601092754/http:/cuccinelli.com/issues.html#Abortion\"><u>first campaign</u></a> for the state Senate in 2002, he has backed a narrow exception for abortions in cases where a mother&rsquo;s life would be endangered by remaining pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli&rsquo;s position was well known to McAuliffe&rsquo;s campaign. In a Sept. 17 <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20020601092754/http:/cuccinelli.com/issues.html#Abortion\"><u>news release</u></a> announcing the ad and justifying its claims, McAuliffe&rsquo;s camp noted that during a 2009 debate, &quot;Cuccinelli said he would support abortion only when the woman&rsquo;s life was at risk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While researching another abortion-related claim this summer, we asked Cuccinelli&rsquo;s camp if the candidate still carved out that lone exception. His advisers declined to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cuccinelli campaign did, however, confirm for <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2013/09/more-mostly-accurate-virginia-attacks/\"><u>FactCheck.org</u></a> and <a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/local/virginia-governors-race-where-they-stand/443/#abortion\"><u>The Washington Post</u></a>, earlier this month that the candidate still holds that abortions should be allowed only to save a mother&rsquo;s life. Both organizations published articles containing the information about a week before McAuliffe&rsquo;s commercial debuted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics are not available for the number of abortions that are performed to save the life of a mother. Neither the Guttmacher Institute nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect such data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guttmacher, in a 2004, conducted a <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf\"><u>survey</u></a> of 1,209 abortion patients. Four percent of the women cited personal health problems as the chief reason they were having an abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe&rsquo;s ad says, &quot;Cuccinelli wants to make all abortion illegal, even in cases of rape and incest, even to protect a woman&rsquo;s health.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli is an adamant opponent of abortion, but he has consistently supported one rare exception: Allowing abortion when a mother&rsquo;s life is endangered by pregnancy. His position was known to McAuliffe&rsquo;s campaign and incongruously cited in its news release announcing the ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to overstate Cuccinelli&rsquo;s objections to abortion, but McAuliffe&rsquo;s ad manages to do just that.
