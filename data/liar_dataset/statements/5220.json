During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in&nbsp;the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that even the two balanced budgets for which Gingrich can claim some credit were collective accomplishments by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gingrich was off-base with this claim -- again. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it&rsquo;s a stretch for him to take credit for anything more than two of those years. We rate Gingrich&rsquo;s claim False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/638b4582-eb6f-4e7e-b410-2bfdee9e7dd5\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/638b4582-eb6f-4e7e-b410-2bfdee9e7dd5</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-23T21:58:42.615256", "ruling_date": "2012-01-23T21:58:15", "ruling_headline": "Newt Gingrich repeats claim that he balanced the federal budget four times as speaker", "ruling_headline_slug": "newt-gingrich-repeats-claim-he-balanced-federal-bu", "ruling_link_text": "Two during his tenure, two after he was gone", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-inaccurate-budget-debt-claims-video-/\">Newt Gingrich inaccurate in budget, debt claims in video announcement</a>,&quot; May 11, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-repeats-claim-about-his-record-balan/\">Newt Gingrich repeats claim about his record of balancing budget, reducing debt</a>,&quot; Dec. 16, 201</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newt Gingrich campaign video, <a href=\"http://www.newt.org/\">http://www.newt.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newt.org/\">White</a> House historical Table 1:1, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals\">Treasury</a> Direct, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 16, "current_job": "", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Newt", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 152, "last_name": "Gingrich", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "newt-gingrich", "pants_count": 12, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/gingrichcutter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/152/", "total_count": 86, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Republican presidential debate in Tampa", "statement_date": "2012-01-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
