It prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage -- or charging higher premiums -- because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the <a href=\"https://congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/\">American Health Care Act</a> (sometimes called &quot;Trumpcare&quot;), insurers would still be <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/\">prohibited</a> from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. The bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives and could be changed in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in its current form, the bill would give states the option to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/wisconsin-voter/2017/05/08/health-care-fight-backfire-gop/101370250/\">Republicans argue</a> those people would be protected, because those states would have to set up high-risk pools to insure people with pre-existing conditions. But many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/\">unaffordable</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The day after the House passed the bill, GOP Wisconsin Gov. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/\">Scott Walker</a> said he <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/05/gov-scott-walker-would-consider-dropping-pre-existing-condition-coverage-rules-wisconsin/101327456/\">would consider</a> allowing insurers to charge higher prices. But later that day -- in an indication of how politically <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/wisconsin-voter/2017/05/08/health-care-fight-backfire-gop/101370250/\">touchy</a> the issue is -- he <a href=\"https://jsonl.in/2pdQeuT\">backed away</a> from that comment after it drew criticism.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pre-existing conditions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers claimed that under the GOP bill, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition, which PolitiFact National rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/blog-posting/headlines-say-gop-bill-makes-sexual-assault-pre-ex/\">Mostly False</a>. PolitiFact National spelled out what would happen under the GOP bill regarding sexual assault and experts told us that the same would apply to domestic violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nutshell:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore says that &quot;under &lsquo;Trumpcare,&rsquo;&quot; the Republican replacement for Obamacare, domestic violence and sexual assault &quot;could be considered pre-existing conditions&quot; -- something that could trigger higher insurance prices for those victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore&rsquo;s claim goes too far. Simply being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault would not mean a person had a pre-existing condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is important to know that conditions stemming from those assaults, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-05-08T14:21:23.907509", "ruling_date": "2017-05-09T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sexual assault, domestic violence themselves are not pre-existing conditions under GOP health bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "sexual-assault-domestic-violence-themselves-are-no", "ruling_link_text": "No, though conditions arising from assaults could be", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gwen Moore, <a href=\"https://gwenmoore.house.gov/press-releases/passage-of-trumpcare-highlights-house-gops-indifference-to-vulnerable-americans/\">news release</a>, May 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Gwen Moore communications director Eric Harris, May 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Magazine, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/05/new-healthcare-bill-ahca-sexual-assault.html\">&quot;In Trump&rsquo;s America, Being Sexually Assaulted Could Make Your Health Insurance More Expensive,&quot;</a> May 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/blog-posting/headlines-say-gop-bill-makes-sexual-assault-pre-ex/\">&quot;Headlines that say GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are misleading,&quot;</a> May 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/21/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-claims-domestic-violence-counts-pre/\">&quot;Michelle Obama claims that domestic violence counts as a pre-exisiting condition in some states,&quot;</a> Sept. 21, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/\">&quot;Does the GOP&#39;s new health care bill still cover pre-existing conditions, as Trump claims?&quot;</a> May 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact North Carolina, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/\">&quot;Does new version of the AHCA protect coverage for pre-existing conditions?&quot;</a> May 4, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms research professor <a href=\"https://chir.georgetown.edu/about/faculty_sabrina_corlette.html\">Sabrina Corlette</a>, May 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Goodcare president <a href=\"http://goodcare.com/about/\">Katy Votava</a>, May 5, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/blogs/wisconsin-voter/2017/05/08/health-care-fight-backfire-gop/101370250/\">&quot;Will health care fight backfire on GOP?&quot;</a> May 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, University of California, San Francisco Institute for Health Policy Studies director <a href=\"http://profiles.ucsf.edu/claire.brindis\">Claire Brindis</a>, May 5, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "U.S. House member -- 4th District", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Gwen", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 883, "last_name": "Moore", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "gwen-moore", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/FACT_Gwen_Moore__OFFICIAL_MUG.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/883/", "total_count": 25, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://gwenmoore.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Under &lsquo;Trumpcare,&rsquo;&quot;
