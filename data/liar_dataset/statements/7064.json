Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, opposes the federal stimulus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s decried President Barack Obama&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.1:\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,</a> which poured $787 billion into the economy, a &quot;waste of money&quot; and a move &quot;to ignore the will of the American people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s released media statements and ads accusing Obama and Sen. Bill Nelson, whom he wants to unseat from the U.S. Senate, of pushing a stimulus that wasted &quot;millions in taxpayer dollars&quot; on things like cocaine-addicted monkeys. (PolitiFact pegged that ad as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/apr/13/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-voted-study-monkeys-c/\">Mostly False</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;ve said time and time again, we cannot spend our way to prosperity,&quot; Mack said in a 2010 media release about the stimulus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s why, on the night of the <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/watch-us-senate-debate-live-right-here\">Oct. 17 Senate debate, </a>Nelson was prepared to use Mack&rsquo;s own political weight against him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;(Mack) rails against the stimulus bill, he didn&rsquo;t tell you he wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation in order to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district,&quot; Nelson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMack, perhaps prepared for the comment, absorbed Nelson&rsquo;s punch unruffled. But he also didn&rsquo;t refute it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s why we decided to fact-check for ourselves.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe started by asking Nelson&rsquo;s campaign for evidence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin gave us <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/498403-mack-stimulus-request.html\">a copy of a letter</a> Mack wrote to Secretary Ray LaHood at the U.S. Transportation Department asking for the money on behalf of Charlotte County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMack&rsquo;s letter, dated September of 2009, asked the federal government for $29 million to build the Southwest Florida Intermodal and Logistics Center, a project to introduce high-speed rail transportation to Southwest Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo read the letter, you&rsquo;d think Mack not only approves of the stimulus, but believes it&rsquo;s a potential boon to Southwest Florida&rsquo;s economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This project will establish a connection between Southwest Florida economic centers and the seaports of Tampa and Manatee counties, advancing the region&rsquo;s economic competitiveness,&quot; Mack wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe letter continued: &quot;This project is shovel-ready and will facilitate the transportation of goods and people throughout Southwest Florida, spurring economic development in a region crucial to the economic health of the state. These aspects make Charlotte County&rsquo;s project an excellent candidate for funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was designed in part to encourage economic growth through investments and infrastructure.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Transportation Department denied the grant, and the project never got off the ground, said Charlotte County administrator Jason Stotzfus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Mack also sent at least two other letters to help the county apply for different stimulus grants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Chances are better if we have the support of our legislators,&quot; Stotzfus said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"about:blank\">Pietro Nivola</a>, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Mack&rsquo;s approach to the stimulus is common.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Constituent services is all about responding to appeals and requests,&quot; Nivola said. &quot; If people in (Mack&rsquo;s) neighborhood were thinking here&#39;s some money, here&#39;s an opportunity...it&#39;s incumbent upon him to follow up.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Vice President Joe Biden used a similar gotcha against Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., during the Oct. 11 vice presidential debate. Ryan, looking flustered, replied that all representatives ask for stimulus money for their constituents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMack political consultant Gary Maloney had a similar analysis, and he offered this analogy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2001 and again in 2003, Nelson voted against tax cuts. But when Floridians wrote him for help on tax issues, Nelson didn&rsquo;t tell those constituents to take a hike because he opposed those bills, Maloney said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In 2009, Mack voted against the stimulus on principle. Nelson voted with Obama, and the Democrat majority prevailed,&quot; Maloney said. &quot;Once the stimulus bill was the law of the land, Mack still represented his constituents. And when Charlotte County applied for funds, Connie naturally helped the taxpayers of his district.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the U.S. Senate debate, Nelson accused Mack of denouncing the stimulus but asking for money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s no secret: Mack frequently bashes the stimulus as an impediment to economic growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet, his letters suggest he thinks the stimulus money would boost his area&rsquo;s economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Nelson&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-02T16:03:10.210993", "ruling_date": "2012-11-02T16:36:19", "ruling_headline": "Bill Nelson said Connie Mack asked for stimulus money for his district", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-nelson-said-connie-mack-asked-stimulus-money-", "ruling_link_text": "Mack says he wouldn't let his district lose out after the law passed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Buzz, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/watch-us-senate-debate-live-right-here\">Watch the Mack/Nelson Senate debate in full,</a> Oct. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.1:\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a>, bill summary, accessed Nov. 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/apr/13/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-voted-study-monkeys-c/\">Connie Mack said Bill Nelson voted to study monkeys on cocaine,</a> April 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Dan McLaughlin, Oct. 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/498403-mack-stimulus-request.html\"><br />\r\n\tLetter from Mack to the U.S. Transportation Department</a>, Sept. 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Charlotte County administrator Jason Stotzfus<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with &nbsp;<a href=\"about:blank\">Pietro Nivola</a>, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE5tbgDHw7I\">Oct. 11 vice presidential debate</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and email interviews, Gary Maloney, Mack political consultant, &nbsp;Nov. 1, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 9, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 179, "last_name": "Nelson", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "bill-nelson", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_100490231_BILL_NELSON.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/179/", "total_count": 32, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Connie Mack &quot;wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation in order to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate in Davie, Fla.", "statement_date": "2012-10-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 150, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/150/", "subject": "Stimulus", "subject_slug": "stimulus", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "U.S. representative from Fort Myers", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Connie", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 1517, "last_name": "Mack", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "connie-mack", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Connie_Mack.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1517/", "total_count": 15, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.conniemack.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
