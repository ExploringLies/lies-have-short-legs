Bruce Rauner has run numerous re-election ads attempting to tie Democratic rival J.B. Pritzker to high taxes, public corruption and powerful Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. In Rauner&rsquo;s telling, Madigan is the ultimate puppet-master of Illinois politics, controlling Pritzker and everyone and everything the governor deems bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Rauner has yet another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6qyhziJ0Aw\">ad </a>that not only hits on the same themes but dispenses with all subtlety by using actual puppets to deliver his points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them,&quot; the talking puppets claim as they ask viewers to take it from them that Madigan is pulling Pritzker&rsquo;s strings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madigan, a Chicago Democrat who has served as speaker for all but two of the past 35 years, undeniably wields considerable power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the side, he also is a partner in a law firm that, like many others, does lucrative work contesting appraisals for commercial and industrial property to secure real-estate tax reductions for clients. So the ad&rsquo;s reference to the money he&rsquo;s made in the field is clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But property tax levies are set at the local level, not by lawmakers in Springfield. That makes the main beat of Rauner&rsquo;s contention a head-scratcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How could Madigan, as a state lawmaker, take action to ensure local property taxes remain high? And what about his work suggests his clients are &quot;cronies&quot; out to game the system?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">A property tax primer</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the thrust of the ad&rsquo;s claim requires a brief journey into the weeds of property taxes in Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state itself stopped taxing property a decade before the 76-year-old Madigan was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, the taxing of property has been largely a local affair, with municipal and county officials determining assessments, tax rates and levies. The state isn&rsquo;t totally divorced from the process, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Madigan&rsquo;s lengthy tenure as speaker, lawmakers and the governor imposed a cap on how much most local governments in the state could raise property tax levies in a given year. Last decade, Springfield responded to soaring home values in Cook County by temporarily imposing limits on the growth of assessments for tax purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite that history, Justin Giorgio, a Rauner campaign spokesman, said Madigan had &quot;consistently&quot; opposed legislation that would prevent local officials from increasing their levies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a two-year state budget standoff between Rauner and Madigan&rsquo;s Democrats, both backed property tax freeze plans, though the speaker&rsquo;s was not as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-budget-idUSKBN19H2PY\">sweeping</a>. Neither plan became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the biggest impact the state has on the size of property tax bills is what it doesn&rsquo;t do. Few states chip in as little to cover school costs as does Illinois, forcing school districts to rely on local revenue streams to cover <a href=\"http://www.revenue.state.il.us/publications/LocalGovernment/PTAX1080.pdf\">more than 60 percent of education costs.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In just about every other state in the union, the state itself puts more into local public schools than we do in Illinois,&quot; said Charles N. Wheeler III, a state budget expert and director of the Public Affairs Reporting program at the University of Illinois-Springfield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That practice has been reinforced for decades by the spending policies set by state Republicans and Democrats alike, despite a goal laid out in the Illinois Constitution for the state to assume <a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/con10.htm\">&quot;primary responsibility&quot;</a> for funding K-12 schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two decades ago, then Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, pushed to change that. He proposed <a href=\"http://www.sj-r.com/article/20160330/OPINION/160339940\">a &quot;tax swap&quot;</a> that would increase the state income tax, using the extra funds to support schools and provide property tax relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That plan passed Madigan&rsquo;s chamber with the speaker&rsquo;s support, but was spiked in the Senate by members of Edgar&rsquo;s own party.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Commonplace practice</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad also accuses Madigan of capitalizing on high property taxes in order to line his pockets by helping &quot;cronies like Pritzker&quot; avoid them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madigan has been elusive about his personal wealth, but he once said that he makes at least $1 million<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-illinois-madigan/\"> &quot;in a good year.&quot;</a> And in 2015, his practice ranked second among law firms for total property tax refunds in Cook County, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-illinois-madigan/\">a Reuters report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giorgio, Rauner&rsquo;s spokesman, pointed us to county records showing <a href=\"http://www.madigetz.com/attorneys/harold-j-hicks.html\">a lawyer from Madigan&rsquo;s firm</a> has represented <a href=\"https://www.pritzkergroup.com/pritzker-group-acquires-lbp-manufacturing-leading-global-food-beverage-packaging-producer/\">a company</a> owned by the investment group Pritzker co-founded, <a href=\"http://www.cookcountyassessor.com/Property.aspx?mode=details&amp;pin=16221040130000\">securing reductions</a> in its property value assessments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are tens of thousands of property assessment appeals filed in Cook County each year by a multitude of law firms, so it is unclear what makes the clients of Madigan&rsquo;s firm &quot;cronies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked, Giorgio pointed only to why the campaign pinned the term on Pritzker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It has<a href=\"http://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/\"> been shown</a> that Madigan&#39;s law firm has received a large number of tax reductions from (Cook County Assessor Joseph) Berrios. Berrios is the head of the Cook County Democratic party, former Democratic State Rep. and an ally of Madigan,&quot; Giorgio wrote in an email. &quot;Pritzker has been a donor to Madigan and Berrios. Pritzker has received successful reductions through hiring Madigan&#39;s law firm from Berrios. That&#39;s clearly a &lsquo;crony&rsquo; connection.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s besides the point, however, because state lawmakers do not set property assessments.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent Rauner ad stars puppets that declare &quot;for decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That claim suggests Madigan, the powerful House speaker, took action as a lawmaker to ensure Illinois property taxes remain some of the nation&rsquo;s highest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For support, Rauner&rsquo;s campaign said Madigan has kept property taxes high by &quot;consistently&quot; opposing legislation to provide property tax relief, even though Madigan&rsquo;s record says otherwise. The claim also ignores the reality that state lawmakers play no direct role in the assessment process, which takes place at the local level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a glimmer of truth in the ad&rsquo;s contention that Madigan is a partner in a law firm that conducts property tax appeals work for those who can afford it, including a Pritzker-owned company. And it&rsquo;s a lucrative business because property taxes are extraordinarily high in Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But skyrocketing property taxes are part of a long and bipartisan legacy in Springfield of foisting the lion&rsquo;s share of public school funding on to local property tax payers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The responsibility for that phenomenon is broadly shared by decades of governors and lawmakers, Madigan included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the ad&rsquo;s claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-05T18:20:27.884017", "ruling_date": "2018-10-07T18:44:22", "ruling_headline": "Rauner ad rewrites property tax history", "ruling_headline_slug": "rauner-ad-rewrites-property-tax-history", "ruling_link_text": "This argument's mostly show", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-illinois-madigan/\">&quot;Madigan&rsquo;s money maker: lowering property taxes for big business,&quot;</a> Reuters, Feb. 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www2.illinois.gov/rev/research/publications/Documents/localgovernment/ptax-1004.pdf\">Guide:</a> The Illinois Property Tax System, Illinois Department of Revenue, accessed Oct. 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://cgfa.ilga.gov/Upload/2014updatePropetyTaxReport.pdf\">Report:</a> Property Taxes in Illinois, Commission on Government Forecasting &amp; Accountability, April 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Property tax cap draws foes; Plan to limit assessments criticized as it heads to House,&quot; Chicago Tribune, Feb. 20, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview: Justin Giorgio, Rauner campaign spokesman, Oct. 2 - 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-budget-idUSKBN19H2PY\">&quot;Illinois House Democrats push tax freeze to end budget impasse,&quot;</a> Reuters, June 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isbe.net/ilreportcarddata\">Report Card Library,</a> Illinois State Board of Education, accessed Oct. 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview: Charles N.
