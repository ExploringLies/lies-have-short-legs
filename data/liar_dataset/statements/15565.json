Did he say what the ad shows?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Reagan in a 1980 campaign speech spoke about immigrants&rsquo; journey to America and of their contributions to society. The ad patched together what Reagan said about immigrants with his closing call for everyone to &quot;make America great again.&quot; The full speech wasn&rsquo;t just about immigrants, it narrated Reagan&rsquo;s grievances with Carter and the economy and Reagan&rsquo;s own vision for America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Becoming American Initiative, a <a href=\"https://www.becomingamericaninitiative.org/about-us/\">conservative</a> <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/types-of-organizations-exempt-under-section-501c4\">a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization</a>, via Twitter but did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Becoming American Initiative ad</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 30-second ad features Reagan&rsquo;s voice over video of him delivering a speech with the Statue of Liberty in the background. It includes black and white video of a crowd of people walking and of men doing construction work, as well as video in color of a man picking fruit, of a child at the border, and a photograph of people waving American flags at what looks like a naturalization ceremony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a transcript of Reagan&rsquo;s words:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>&quot;Through this Golden Door has come millions of men and women.

Reagan went on to beat Democrat Jimmy Carter in the November election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Statue of Liberty in the background, Reagan paid tribute to immigrants, starting his speech by saying they came to America to work and helped build cities and &quot;incredibly productive farms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reagan twice said &quot;make America great again&quot;: around the middle of the speech, when he spoke about what his administration will do; and toward the end of the speech, when he called on everyone to also &quot;make America great again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad from Becoming American Initiative cut and patched together sentences. Below is a partial transcript of Reagan&rsquo;s speech, in bold are the words the ad highlighted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>&quot;<strong>Through this Golden Door</strong>, under the gaze of that Mother of Exiles, <strong>has come millions of men and women</strong>, who first stepped foot on American soil right there, on Ellis Island, so close to the Statue of Liberty.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em><strong>These families came here to work</strong>. They came to build. <strong>Others came to America</strong> in different ways, from other lands, under different,<strong> and often harrowing conditions</strong>, but this place symbolizes what they all managed to build, no matter where they came from or how they came or how much they suffered.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>They helped to build that magnificent city across the river. They spread across the land building other cities and towns and incredibly productive farms.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>They came to make America work. <strong>They didn&rsquo;t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this, this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history</strong>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em><strong>They brought with them courage</strong>, ambition <strong>and the values of family</strong>, neighborhood, <strong>work</strong>, peace <strong>and freedom</strong>. We all came from different lands but we shared the same values, the same dream.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>Today a President of the United States would have us believe that dream is over or at least in need of change.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s Administration tells us that the descendants of those who sacrificed to start again in this land of freedom may have to abandon the dream that drew their ancestors to a new life in a new land.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>The Carter record is a litany of despair, of broken promises, of sacred trusts abandoned and forgotten. ...</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>This country needs a new administration, with a renewed dedication to the dream of an America -- an administration that will give that dream new life and make America great again! Restoring and revitalizing that dream will take bold action. ...</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>&nbsp;I want more than anything I&#39;ve ever wanted, to have an administration that will, through its actions, at home and in the international arena, let millions of people know that Miss Liberty still &quot;lifts her lamp beside the golden door.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>Through our international broadcasting stations -- the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and the others -- let us send, loud and clear, the message that this generation of Americans intends to keep that lamp shining; that this dream, that this dream the last best hope of man on earth, this nation under God, shall not perish from the earth.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em>We will instead carry on the building of an American economy that once again holds forth real opportunity for all, we shall continue to be a symbol of freedom and guardian of the eternal values that so inspired those who came to this port of entry.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><em><strong>Let us pledge to each other</strong>, with this Great Lady looking on, <strong>that we can</strong>, and so help us God, we will <strong>make America great again</strong>.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several years later, Reagan signed into law the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/26/tom-cotton/sen-tom-cotton-misleads-claim-about-dream-act-amne/\">1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards &mdash; including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A Becoming American Initiative ad claimed Ronald Reagan said immigrants &quot;brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is based on a 1980 Labor Day campaign speech in New Jersey, where Reagan lauded immigrants&rsquo; contributions, while also listing his grievances with Carter and his own vision for America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reagan didn&rsquo;t say immigrants &quot;made America great&quot; verbatim, but he did imply it. The ad cuts out some of Reagan&rsquo;s words to make the comments appear adjacent.
