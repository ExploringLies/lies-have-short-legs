It <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/foodshare/pdf/ataglance/2013/Ataglance201303.pdf\">serves</a> more than 850,000 adults and children, or 15 percent of the state&rsquo;s residents, at a cost of more than $1 billion per year.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Junk-food bill</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTo take effect, Kaufert&rsquo;s bill would need approval not only from the state Senate and Gov. Scott Walker but also the federal government. That&#39;s unlikely (for Wisconsin and South Carolina, which is considering a similar measure), <em>Governing</em> magazine suggests, given the USDA <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/blogs/view/gov-should-states-limit-what-foods-are-purchased-with-food-stamps.html\">has denied</a> every request like Kaufert&rsquo;s that&#39;s been submitted for a federal &quot;waiver.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s get <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/proposals/ab110\">the bill</a> out on the table, anyway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tKaufert&rsquo;s measure does not define junk food; rather, it would require FoodShare recipients to spend at least two-thirds of their benefits on a list of foods deemed by the state as healthy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe healthy foods list would have two components.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIt begins with a <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/P4/P44578.pdf\">roster of foods</a> approved by another federal-state food program -- Women, Infants and Children (<a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic\">WIC</a>); then the bill adds some other food types, as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo, where does that leave organic foods?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWell, since the bill wouldn&rsquo;t make any changes for one-third of a FoodShare recipient&rsquo;s benefits, they could be used to buy anything from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1wympj8xI1rpnz4ao1_400.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/funions&amp;h=504&amp;w=361&amp;sz=76&amp;tbnid=ZT1vdu22mVp_pM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=64&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__b-zSqYEcdw8StGXoeNXZ3lce65E=&amp;docid=9oODlyOx4sK1ZM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qvGLUaPIOMbvygH33YHAAQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ9QEwAQ&amp;dur=540\">Funyuns</a> to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=604&amp;q=organic+foods&amp;oq=organic+foods&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l6j0i5l4.1358.2764.0.2915.13.10.0.3.3.0.72.457.10.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.12.img.AcoiGwG_QFE#tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=organic+onions&amp;oq=organic+onions&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24l3.10512.52667.1.52808.10.8.0.2.2.0.245.646.7j0j1.8.0...0.0...1c.1.12.img.u4fen3knvjI&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;fp=b45a1b732d0d3344&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=604&amp;imgrc=c5dPztUgKE7ANM%3A%3BcaCBfJOIQnogLM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.christopherranch.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252Forganic_specialty_onions.jpg%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.christopherranch.com%252Farchives%252Fproducts%252Forganic-specialty-onions%3B320%3B216\">organic specialty onions</a>.

So, using the two-thirds to buy organic versions of those foods would be OK, unless the state at some point specifically prohibited them, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOn the other hand, WIC benefits can&rsquo;t be used for organic versions of some foods -- such as milk, cereal, bread and canned or dried peas, beans and lentils. (The government wants to encourage cheaper alternatives to stretch the money beneficiaries receive, according to the state Department of Health Services).
