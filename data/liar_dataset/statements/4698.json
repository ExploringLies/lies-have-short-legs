An ad criticizing Sweeney claims the South Jersey Democrat&rsquo;s &quot;Obama-style policies&quot; are responsible for high unemployment in the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;How? Sweeney gave us the nation&#39;s highest income tax rates, driving out jobs. Sweeney backs cap and trade and raising electric rates, which will drive out more jobs. And Sweeney backs Obama&rsquo;s job-destroying government health care plan and Obama&#39;s failed stimulus schemes,&quot; the ad says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHigh taxes. Fewer jobs. We&rsquo;ve heard -- and checked -- similar claims before, but never specifically on income tax rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did Sweeney give New Jersey the nation&#39;s highest income tax rate, driving jobs out of state?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSweeney took office as a state Senator in 2002. Since then, New Jersey has never had the the highest income tax rate in the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Legislature increased the top income tax rate in 2004 and 2009. Sweeney voted for both measures, but he&rsquo;s just one vote among many and the governor signed both bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2004, New Jersey&rsquo;s top income tax rate went from 6.37 percent on those making more than $75,000 to 8.97 percent on those making more than $500,000 with the so-called &quot;millionaires&rsquo; tax.&quot; Several other states, including California, Montana and Vermont, all had higher income tax rates that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, the state&rsquo;s top income tax rate increased to 10.75 percent on incomes over $1 million. &nbsp;Even then, Hawaii and Oregon had slightly larger top income tax rates of 11 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tax expired in 2010. Sweeney became the state Senate president the same year. He has tried twice since then to reinstate the &quot;millionaires&rsquo; tax,&quot; but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed both measures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteve Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, argued that all taxes, whether they are sales taxes or property taxes, &quot;conspire to be a tax of everyone&rsquo;s income.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the ad clearly says New Jersey has the &quot;nation&#39;s highest income tax rate,&quot; while showing a photo of a New Jersey residential income tax form. So, on that point, the ad is wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut are New Jersey&rsquo;s income tax rates responsible for job loss?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLonegan referred to a Tax Foundation study that ranked New Jersey as the worst in the nation for state and local tax burdens. And according to the tax research group, the Garden State ranks number one in that category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut when it comes to the destruction of jobs, taxes may be one factor, but they aren&rsquo;t the only factor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Everything matters,&quot; said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. &quot;But taxes also matter.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRonald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, said the argument that increasing the top income tax rates discourages people from taking risks and starting businesses &quot;really overstates the effect of the tax rates. There are a lot of other factors that come into play.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose factors, according to Alt, include: the level of education in the state, how close the business is to its market and suppliers, who the business is selling to and the overall cost of doing business in the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched an ad campaign targeting Democratic incumbents running for re-election. One television spot said, &quot;Sweeney gave us the nation&#39;s highest income tax rates, driving out jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring Sweeney&rsquo;s tenure the top income tax rate in New Jersey increased twice. Neither of those tax hikes bumped New Jersey into the top spot in the nation for income taxes &nbsp;-- and you can&rsquo;t solely blame Sweeney for either increase. And the ad&rsquo;s larger point that high incomes tax rates decreased jobs is overstated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/politifact_nj_conservative_gro.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-28T16:33:44.032608", "ruling_date": "2011-10-31T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Conservative group claims Stephen Sweeney gave New Jersey the nation\u2019s highest income tax rates, driving out jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservative-group-claims-steve-sweeney-gave-new-j", "ruling_link_text": "We\u2019re not #1 on this tax", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmerican for Prosperity New Jersey&rsquo;s YouTube Channel, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIB65m3Wolo\">Steve Sweeney&#39;s Obama-Style Policies</a>, Oct. 24, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican for Prosperity New Jersey&rsquo;s, <a href=\"http://americansforprosperity.org/102511-pr-afp-launches-media-blitz-across-new-jersey-educate-citizens-high-tax-big-spending-records-#ixzz1c0Qwfas4\">Americans for Prosperity Launches Media Blitz Across New Jersey to Educate Citizens on High Tax, Big Spending Records of Trenton Lawmakers</a>, Oct. 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/25229.html\">Major Components of the State Business Tax Climate Index, FY 2011</a>, Oct. 26, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Foundation, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/research/show/228.html#state_individualincome_rates-2000-2011-20110503\">State Individual Income Tax Rates, 2000-2011</a>, March 3, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Legislature, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2008/Bills/PL09/69_.HTM\">Assembly Bill 4102</a>, passed June 25, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Legislature, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2004/Bills/PL04/40_.HTM\">Assembly Bill 100</a>, passed June 21, 2004<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Ronald Alt, senior research associate with <a href=\"http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/staff.html\">Federation of Tax Administrators</a>, Oct. 28, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Chris Donnelly, spokesman for state Sen.
