But nothing is typical about the battle between incumbent Republican Bruce Rauner and Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defying convention, Rauner has spent a good portion of his term stressing the negative. He has said Illinois is in a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-rahm-emanuel-taxes-20180427-story.html\">death</a> <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-will-illinois-disaster-rauner-madigan-20171117-story.html\">spiral</a>&quot;&nbsp;and complained that Indiana is &quot;<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-bruce-rauner-state-of-the-state-edit-20150204-story.html\">kicking our tails</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks ago, Rauner had to do damage control <a href=\"https://www.wcia.com/news/local-news/rauner-disses-champaign-urbana-not-much-of-a-workforce-/1265003695\">after publicly dissing </a>the workforce in Downstate Champaign-Urbana, home of the main campus of the University of Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the incumbent <a href=\"http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20180119/BLOGS02/180119869/rauner-steps-in-it-as-illinois-celebrates-an-amazon-milestone\">routinely calling into question</a> the state&rsquo;s ability to attract business, Pritzker recently tried the opposite tack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JBPritzker/status/1024376653689102337\">in a video</a> tweeted out by his campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have the most educated, dedicated workforce in the entire nation and that is why businesses want to come here,&quot; Pritzker says in the clip, which features footage of the candidate visiting offices, farms and classrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tops in the nation is a high bar to meet when it comes to assessing the educational achievement of Illinois workers. So we thought Pritzker&rsquo;s claim worth checking out.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Cum laude, yes&mdash;but certainly not summa</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Dedicated&quot; is an unknowable state of mind, so it&rsquo;s impossible to assess the second beat of Pritzker&rsquo;s statement. Educational achievement, however, is a widely measured concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://wallethub.com/edu/most-educated-states/31075\">A report</a> ranking states from most to least educated produced by the financial information site WalletHub, for instance, received considerable coverage this year. And <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/the-10-most-educated-states-in-the-us\">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> also routinely releases lists of the states with the highest education levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither ranks Illinois as number one among states&mdash;or even in the top ten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Pritzker&rsquo;s campaign to explain Illinois&rsquo; absence from the top of those rankings, and spokesman Jason Rubin didn&rsquo;t attempt to back up his boss with facts. Instead, Rubin reframed Pritzker&rsquo;s statement as opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unlike Bruce Rauner, J.B. Pritzker believes Illinois has the most dedicated, educated workforce in the country,&quot; Rubin wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gold standard for ranking education achievement among the states is the U.S. Census, which also provides estimates for the share of each state&rsquo;s workforce that holds degrees. That is a metric more closely in line with Pritzker&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that count, Illinois fares slightly better than it did in the broader assessments from WalletHub and U.S. News. According to the Census, nearly 40 percent of Illinois&rsquo; labor force had attained at least a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree as of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed right\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That puts Illinois&rsquo; workforce in 10th place nationally. Tops on the list was Massachusetts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By a slightly different measure, Minnesota leads the states when it comes to the share of the labor force with at least some college credit or a community college Associate&rsquo;s degree. Illinois was 13th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Illinois does, however, have an edge over its immediate neighboring states when it comes to its share of college-educated workers, census data show. That is a factor that could bear importance for white-collar businesses looking to relocate to the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chicago-based demographer Rob Paral said that&rsquo;s not surprising given that Chicago, which is home to roughly one-fifth of Illinois&rsquo; population, boasts <a href=\"https://midwest.chicagofedblogs.org/?cat=6\">the highest percentage of college graduates</a> among the nation&rsquo;s seven largest cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pritzker said Illinois has &quot;the most educated workforce &hellip; in the entire nation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But census figures show the state ranks tenth for the share of its workforce that holds a Bachelor&#39;s degree or higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When pressed, Pritzker&rsquo;s campaign made no attempt to back up his claim, restating it as a matter of opinion rather than fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pritzker&rsquo;s praise for the educational prowess of Illinois&rsquo; workforce is not entirely out of left field, but it falls well short of the numbers. We rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-03T17:39:15.241242", "ruling_date": "2018-08-05T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Pritzker called Illinois\u2019 workforce the nation\u2019s most educated.
