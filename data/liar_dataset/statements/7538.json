Rose, who previously served as vice chancellor, replaced <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2013/01/george_pernsteiner_oregon_high.html\">George Pernsteiner, who announced his resignation in January</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRose faces many challenges as the state revamps its higher education system, and she will apparently be compensated well for her work &mdash; too well, according to Keizer resident Gene H. McIntyre.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://keizertimes.com/2013/02/22/salaries-of-state-education-chiefs-are-too-high/\">Feb. 22 guest opinion column for the Keizertimes</a>, McIntyre wrote that &quot;We will pay (Rose) a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year, and that&rsquo;s to start, an amount that does not include the costs of this public employee&rsquo;s benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance, and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat got our mouths watering and our minds wondering. Fine dining practically every day? A lavish house and upscale car? (Perhaps journalism was not our true calling?)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe obtained a copy of Rose&rsquo;s employment agreement, which shows that she earns an annual base salary of $260,004.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRose receives $14,424 in annual medical benefits, the same as other employees in the Chancellor&rsquo;s Office, according to Di Saunders, spokeswoman for the Oregon University System.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRose is not enrolled in the Public Employees Retirement System. Instead, she <a href=\"http://ous.edu/dept/hr/benefits/orp\">chose the Optional Retirement Plan</a>, a defined contribution plan created in 1996 for unclassified academic and administrative employees. The university system contributes the maximum $51,000 toward her retirement every year.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRose also receives a $12,000 annual car allowance for her to drive to various campuses and meetings. She does not receive mileage reimbursements.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThen there&rsquo;s the annual $20,694 she receives &quot;for professional development and expenses,&quot; according to her contract. The money is paid to Rose like salary and is considered taxable income, Saunders said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe money is intended to cover membership dues for civic clubs, conference fees, and &quot;appropriate and necessary expenses that might not be eligible for expense reimbursement under OUS policy,&quot; Saunders wrote in an e-mail.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s somebody coming to speak at a conference, and they take them out to dinner,&quot; Saunders said. &quot;It&rsquo;s things that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to use your general fund budget for, but they&rsquo;re expenses a chancellor should take care of.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRose is not required to submit receipts for those expenses, so she could theoretically use all of that money at upscale restaurants. If she spent $100 on each fine-dining meal, she could treat herself to about 207 fancy meals.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNow about that &quot;lavish house.&quot; The chancellor is offered Treetops, a mansion adjacent to the University of Oregon in Eugene. The 8,000-square-foot mansion, built in 1911, was the official home of Pernsteiner, who split his time between Eugene and Portland.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRose declined to move to Treetops and lives in Portland with her family, Saunders said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAll told, Rose receives $358,122 annually in salary, benefits and expenses. She&rsquo;s also entitled to the usual reimbursements for work-related expenses and travel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIs Rose&rsquo;s compensation out of line? Saunders directed us to <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Median-Salaries-of-Senior/126455/\">a 2011 chart on the website of The Chronicle of Higher Education that shows median salaries</a>&mdash; not including benefits &mdash; of senior college administrators. Administrators at Rose&rsquo;s level have an overall median salary of $322,700.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcIntyre based his column on information he had gathered through his years working in education and state government, he said in a phone interview from his Keizer home. McIntyre says he&rsquo;s a retired language arts and social sciences teacher who served about a decade on the now-defunct Oregon Educational Coordinating Commission, which oversaw the distribution of federal education money.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;I know people can live very, very well on a lot less money than we&rsquo;re paying these people,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a lot of social problems &mdash; a lot of kids are going hungry, a lot of folks have lost their homes &mdash; and yet, we continue to pay some of these people just what I&rsquo;d consider excessive amounts of money.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut is it true that Rose receives &quot;a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year&quot; and &quot;benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar&quot; as McIntyre wrote in his column?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRose earns $260,004 in base salary -- not quite the $300,000 McIntyre cites. It&rsquo;s accurate to say her base salary does not include the $65,424 she gets in medical and retirement benefits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcIntyre&rsquo;s description of Rose&rsquo;s other perks is partially true: Rose receives a car allowance and an expense account, but she does not live in Treetops and likely isn&rsquo;t treating herself to fine dining almost every day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe rate this statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-19T18:25:13.256998", "ruling_date": "2013-03-20T03:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Does the OUS chancellor get lavish house, upscale car and fancy dining at taxpayer expense?
