Chris Christie returned to a familiar rallying cry: job growth in New Jersey is among the highest in the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;ve added nearly 85,000 private-sector jobs since February of 2010, seeing the best year of private-sector job growth in 2011 in over a decade and with 2012 already on pace to be even stronger,&quot; Christie said in a speech during the special session of the state Legislature.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation and we&rsquo;re seeing housing sales, car sales and personal income increasing at higher rates than the nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in claiming &quot;our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation,&quot; the Republican governor also was making a familiar mistake, PolitiFact New Jersey found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we&rsquo;ve noted in previous fact-checks, job growth can be measured in two ways -- the net increase in jobs and the percentage increase. Looking at percentage increases accounts for states&rsquo; different population sizes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie&rsquo;s claim is right in terms of the net increase, but wrong in regard to the percentage increase, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBetween May 2011 and May 2012, New Jersey gained 59,800 total nonfarm jobs -- including private- and public-sector employment -- for an increase of nearly 1.6 percent, according to the bureau. The May 2012 figures are preliminary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat net increase places the Garden State in sixth place among the 50 states, just as Christie said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the percentage increase leaves the state in 13th place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/27/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-private-sector-job-growth-20/\">made the same mistake</a> in February, when he said private-sector job growth in 2011 &quot;places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states.&quot; He received a Half True, because his claim was right for the net increase, but wrong for the percentage increase.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe governor&#39;s office did not respond to requests for comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a speech Monday during the special session of the state Legislature, Christie claimed &quot;our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a very specific claim, but it&rsquo;s only true when you look at New Jersey&rsquo;s net increase of 59,800 total nonfarm jobs between May 2011 and May 2012. The percentage increase of nearly 1.6 percent leaves the state in 13th place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/politifact_nj_chris_christie_c_3.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-03T15:42:14.124718", "ruling_date": "2012-07-04T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims New Jersey\u2019s job gains in the last year \u201cwas the sixth highest in the nation\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-new-jerseys-job-gains-last-y", "ruling_link_text": "Making the same mistake", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey Governor&rsquo;s Office, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552012/approved/20120702a.html\">Governor Chris Christie Calls On State Legislature To Act On Tax Relief At Special Session</a>, July 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XTpwlY82Gs&amp;feature=relmfu\">Chris Christie - Address to Special Session of Legislature</a>, a video posted on YouTube on July 2, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/27/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-private-sector-job-growth-20/\">Chris Christie claims private-sector job growth in 2011 places New Jersey in the top third among the states</a>, Feb. 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/laus.pdf\">Regional and State Employment and Unemployment -- May 2012</a>, June 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://lwd.state.nj.us/labor/lwdhome/press/2012/20120614_unemployment_release.html\"> New Jersey Sees Largest Monthly Job Gain in More than Seven Years, Employers add 17,600 jobs in May</a>, June 14, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Governor of New Jersey", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 27, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1251, "last_name": "Christie", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "chris-christie", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/christie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1251/", "total_count": 105, "true_count": 21, "website": "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays &quot;our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech before the state Legislature", "statement_date": "2012-07-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
