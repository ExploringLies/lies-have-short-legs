The parents had supposedly found the baby (alive) in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce with bite marks on the boy&rsquo;s arms and legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So even in the context of the post, he didn&rsquo;t really get eaten. If it&rsquo;s any comfort, not only is the story fake, it also said the boy was expected to recover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo included on most of the posts is not a ravenous, drug-smoking teenager from Missouri.
