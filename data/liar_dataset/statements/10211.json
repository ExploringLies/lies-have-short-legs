Scott Walker as a &quot;rock star&quot; and a &quot;genuine hero&quot; after the Republican won his third statewide election in a row -- the latest coming two years after Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin handily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 7, 2014, <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/3881634772001/gov-scott-walker-urges-the-gop-to-get-out-there-and-lead/#sp=show-clips\">Walker told</a> one of those fans, syndicated TV and radio host Sean Hannity, that he did it despite Obama&rsquo;s pre-election visit to Milwaukee&rsquo;s central city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn&#39;t even (increase) the vote there,&quot; Walker said of Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the details of Walker&rsquo;s win begins to fade away, let&rsquo;s check his claim that Obama couldn&rsquo;t boost the Democratic turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 election, in which Walker topped Democrat Mary Burke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 28, 2014, Obama joined Burke, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee at North Division High School in the heart of the city&rsquo;s predominantly African-American north side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-tells-supporters-to-be-wary-of-obamas-support-for-burke-b99379685z1-280676892.html\">rally for Burke </a>drew an overflow crowd estimated at 3,500, and Obama lightheartedly pleaded with attendees to back Burke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Grab your friends, and grab your coworkers, and grab the lazy cousin who&rsquo;s sitting at home, never votes during the midterm elections,&quot; the president said. &quot;He&rsquo;s watching reruns of old Packer games. Just grab him up. Take all of them to cast their ballot, and cast their ballot for Mary Burke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high school is a voting site (Ward 143) on Election Day, and Walker was right that in the 2012 presidential race Obama won 99 percent in that ward amid turnout that -- following historical patterns -- was larger than in non-presidential years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd at North Division was the biggest of the campaign season for either side and appeared to energize Democrats, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on Election Day, did Obama&rsquo;s urging work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digging into the claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker didn&rsquo;t specify what election he was comparing to the turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could have been the 2012 presidential race. Turnout then was much higher compared to the 2014 governor&rsquo;s race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the most logical starting point is the most recent governor&rsquo;s race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would be the June 2012 special election, prompted by the recall drive that followed Walker&rsquo;s surprise move to sharply curtail collective bargaining for most public employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker seemed to be focused specifically on that one ward. And, indeed, turnout in Ward 143 was down 9 percent from June 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at city turnout overall, it&rsquo;s the same story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2012, turnout topped 73% of pre-registered Milwaukee voters, reflecting the intensity of a race that riveted the state for months. More than 223,000 Milwaukeeans voted in that race, with three-fourths backing Barrett.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tally of those in Milwaukee who voted Democratic in the recall race was 171,150.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2014 Walker-Burke race, that number fell to 156,167.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if you go back to the 2010 governor&rsquo;s race, which also pitted Barrett and Walker?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the last regularly scheduled governor&rsquo;s race, so the dynamics are more comparable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results are mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ward 143 (then known as Ward 109, before maps were redrawn after 2010) produced a higher Democratic vote for governor in 2010 than in 2014. So, by that measure Walker is on the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the citywide Democratic turnout in 2014 the turnout was higher than that in 2010. Burke drew 13 percent more Milwaukee votes in 2014 than Barrett did in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said: &quot;The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn&#39;t even (increase) the vote there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers back him up: turnout in that ward -- and citywide was down, and so were the votes for Democrats in 2014 when compared to the most recent governor&rsquo;s race, the 2012 recall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turnout also was down in that ward compared to the 2010 turnout in Walker&rsquo;s first race, though citywide it was higher in 2014 than four years earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-11-11T16:30:54.724650", "ruling_date": "2014-11-12T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker: Obama visit failed to boost Democratic turnout in Milwaukee", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-obama-visit-failed-boost-democratic-t", "ruling_link_text": "2012 recall vote was higher", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Scott Walker <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/3881634772001/gov-scott-walker-urges-the-gop-to-get-out-there-and-lead/#sp=show-clips\">on Hannity</a>, Nov. 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Tom Evenson, Walker campaign, Nov. 9, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Neil Albrecht, executive director, Milwaukee Election Commission, Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turnout totals from Milwaukee Election Commission</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn&#39;t even (increase) the vote there.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2014-11-07", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 841, "last_name": "Democratic Party of Wisconsin", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "state-democratic-party-wisconsin", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Dem-donkey.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/841/", "total_count": 25, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.wisdems.org/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
