No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;You like girls that are 5-foot-1? They come up to you-know-where.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;If Ivanka weren&#39;t my daughter, perhaps I&#39;d be dating her.&quot; (with an image a father and daughter)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;And you can tell them to go f--- themselves.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last quote, the expletive is bleeped out, but it&rsquo;s clear what word the woman in the ad is mouthing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad then asks, &quot;Does Donald Trump really speak for you?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, the &quot;f--- themselves&quot; portion of the ad doesn&#39;t speak for Trump either, at least when it comes to referring to women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our partners at the&nbsp;Political TV Ad Archive&nbsp;helped us identify that Trump&#39;s voice in that quote was taken from an Feb. 4, 2016, speech he made in New Hampshire. His comment dealt with businesses leaving the United States, not women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re going to bring businesses back. We&#39;re going to have businesses that are now in Mexico come back to New Hampshire and you can tell them to go f--- themselves,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Because they let you down, and they left.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump clearly mouths the expletive, but he says the word very softly, if at all. Watch for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8MhkheHJvM\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Priorities USA, spokesman Justin Barasky said, &quot;we never claimed it was a reference to women at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That ad &quot;wasn&#39;t just about Donald Trump&#39;s overt sexism. It was actually about how divisive he is and how his character is that of someone who should never be president of the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;In no way do we ever claim he was saying that to women. There is no fast one trying to be pulled.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, at the very end, when the announcer asks, &quot;Does Donald Trump really speak for you?&quot; the images of seven women &mdash; and no men &mdash; flash across the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The super PAC said it plans to spend $6 million airing that ad and a companion Trump attack ad in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada over a three-week period. The <a href=\"http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_donaldtrump_227d7/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>second ad</u></a> focuses exclusively on women&#39;s issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a news release announcing the ad buy, Priorities USA, said, &quot;Our paid media campaign starts by highlighting (Trump&#39;s) divisive views on women.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/732535400498143232\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>tweet</u></a> about the ad, complained that he wasn&#39;t talking about women in the clip, although he mistakenly said he was referring to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, that was a mistake, too. The clear context was about businesses that left for places like Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Priorities USA, in an anti-Trump ad, quotes the candidate as saying, &quot;And you can tell them to go (bleep) themselves.&quot; It comes after multiple comments critical of women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The super PAC says the sound clip wasn&#39;t meant to be taken as a reference to women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That, as Trump might say, is a huuuuuuuge stretch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is all about women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It features seven women and two men, only one of whom has a speaking role. All of the mouthed phrases &mdash; except the one in question &mdash; clearly attack, criticize or make disturbing references to women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad offers no indication that the &quot;f--- themselves&quot; line refers to anything but women. In fact, it refers to businesses that left the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement in the ad represents a ridiculous misrepresentation of what Trump said. We rate it Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/600ae970-2bd5-47aa-b74b-c9270aa48e6f\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/600ae970-2bd5-47aa-b74b-c9270aa48e6f</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-18T16:34:00.692908", "ruling_date": "2016-05-18T17:16:40", "ruling_headline": "Priorities USA ad rips Trump's 'f--- themselves' quote way out of context", "ruling_headline_slug": "priorities-usa-donald-trump-women-ad", "ruling_link_text": "Trump was talking about businesses leaving the U.S.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Political TV Ad Archive, &quot;<a href=\"http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_donaldtrump_rwn9h/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Speak</u></a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_donaldtrump_227d7/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Respect</u></a>,&quot; May 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/m8MhkheHJvM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump- Tell Them to Go ---- Themselves</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and emails, Justin Barasky, spokesman, Priorities USA, May 18, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "", "id": 1796, "last_name": "Priorities USA Action", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "priorities-usa-action", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/priorities.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1796/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.prioritiesusaaction.org/about"}, "statement": "<p>Says Donald Trump said of women, &quot;And you can tell them to go f--- themselves.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television ad", "statement_date": "2016-05-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 146, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/146/", "subject": "Women", "subject_slug": "women", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "A Pants on Fire new attack ad"}
