By February, Ossoff was fielding questions on where he lives. He acknowledged that he and his girlfriend (now fiancee) live near Emory University where she&rsquo;s in medical school. That&rsquo;s next door to the 6th District, but not in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/19/politics/jon-ossoff-karen-handel-georgia/index.html\">CNN</a> brought it up, Ossoff said he plans to move back to the district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As soon as she concludes her medical training, I will be back into the district where I grew up, but I want to support her and her career and do right by her,&quot; he said. &quot;I will be 10 minutes back up the road where I grew up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How far away is he from the district&rsquo;s boundaries?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Ossoff&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://electjon.com/about-jon/\">biography</a> on his website, he was raised in Northlake, an unincorporated community in the 6th District. Taking nothing for granted, we mapped the distance from the Emory University campus to his old stomping grounds. According to Google, it&rsquo;s about 6 miles and takes about 17&nbsp;minutes to drive, non-rush hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/anwtKLFrAaTh0rORSpPIATvCVuGFiccIsOxuOT7UOBXcuo64nA9T9dQiTkVpCOQOc12r1CY5w9iNEgQEReRFMDZ648j3n9-HTe128OxVhOP_fRSAFo_ziiiJxtSUHEWg9_sQu1mu\" style=\"height:331px; width:554px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ossoff told MSNBC he lives about two miles from the district line. The medical school itself is about four miles away,&nbsp;and according to Google, about a 12-minute drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To round out the picture, Ossoff&rsquo;s opponent, Republican Karen Handel, grew up in the Maryland suburbs of Washington and has lived in the 6th District for 25 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Ossoff doesn&rsquo;t live in the 6th District. That is correct. Depending on how you map it, he lives about 2&nbsp;to 6 miles either from the district or the neighborhood where he was raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p> <div class='artembed'>See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-06-20T12:14:24.852115", "ruling_date": "2017-06-20T12:13:08", "ruling_headline": "Trump is right: Ossoff does not live in Georgia's 6th Congressional District", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-right-ossoff-does-not-live-georgias-6th-cong", "ruling_link_text": "He lives one district over", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/877101173412638720\">tweet</a>, June 20, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/19/politics/jon-ossoff-karen-handel-georgia/index.html\">Jon Ossoff doesn&#39;t live in his district.
