He added that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had recently said Powers raised UT-Austin&rsquo;s &quot;four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWe were unaware of such a spike since Powers took over as president in 2006.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAfter emailing Mackowiak about his conclusion, we turned to news stories on campus graduation rates as well as research cupboarded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAccording to a June 7, 2012, <em>American-Statesman</em> article, Powers set a goal in 2011 of at least 70 percent of the fall 2012 entering class earning a degree within four years. In contrast, UT&#39;s graduation rate had lately ranged from about 46 percent in 2000 to nearly 53 percent in 2005, the story said, with the 51 percent rate for the class of 2011 proving to be the highest among the state&#39;s 38 public universities for that year.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tA Feb. 12, 2013, <em>Statesman</em> news story said UT efforts to meet the goal &quot;include stepped-up freshman orientation to reshape a campus culture that has long tolerated a more leisurely trajectory to graduation; the appointment of a senior vice provost to champion the four-year graduation cause; and the allotment of $5 million to encourage students to finish on time, with some of that money earmarked for financial aid to those making steady academic progress.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tNext, we asked the coordinating board for its calculation of UT-Austin&rsquo;s four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Dominic Chavez emailed us a spreadsheet indicating the rate has ranged from 52 percent in fiscal 2007, which began Sept. 1, 2006, about seven months into Powers&rsquo; tenure, to 53 percent in fiscal 2012, the year ending Aug. 31, 2012.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tChavez <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDvMyFYHw-g9028debUy7g_LSdXxV-X2WZk59QFXAyA/pub\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">said</a> each board calculation reflects the share of full-time students who enrolled in the fall of the year four years before, meaning the 2012 rate would sweep in students who had first enrolled in fall 2008 and graduated by the end of August 2012. Chavez said the reported rates may differ from other calculations because the board credits an institution where a student began his education even if the student has transferred and ultimately graduated elsewhere.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWe also asked UT-Austin about its four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Gary Susswein emailed a <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/04012013%20utaustinfouryrgraduationrateresponsepftexas.xlsx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">spreadsheet</a> indicating the four-year rate has improved from 51 to 52 percent through Powers&rsquo; presidency.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAs we gathered this information, Mackowiak said by email that he picked up the graduation statistic from remarks by Cigarroa during a public interview by the Texas Tribune. In the March 28, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2013/03/28/triblive-cigarroa-on-powers-and-the-regents/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">interview</a>, Cigarroa credited Powers for saying &quot;we will increase the four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent. And he put his neck out on the line and he&rsquo;s going to do it.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tOn review, Mackowiak said, it&rsquo;s clear the escalated four-year graduation rate is a goal. &quot;It&rsquo;s my mistake,&quot; he wrote. At Mackowiak&#39;s nudge, the <em>American-Statesman</em> published a correction of his column.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tMackowiak said UT-Austin&rsquo;s president had driven four-year graduation rates to 75 percent.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tHowever, the latest four-year graduation rate on the campus was no greater than 53 percent, compared to rates the same or a bit lower in the other full years of Powers&rsquo; presidency. The institution&#39;s declared goal is a four-year rate of at least 70 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWe rate the claim as False.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t<em><strong>UPDATE, April 9, 2013</strong></em>: This story was updated to reflect the <em>American-Statesman</em> publishing a correction of Mackowiak&#39;s oped column.
