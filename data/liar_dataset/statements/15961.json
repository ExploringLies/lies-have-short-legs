Private companies would increase tolls and other costs for Missouri residents, Hoagenson claimed, and don&rsquo;t create much union work.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Experts we talked to agreed Missouri&rsquo;s roads are severely underfunded.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve fact-checked other public officials&rsquo; comments about infrastructure quality, so we wanted to see where Missouri&rsquo;s roads rank, and if they are as bad as Hoagenson says.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Lots of road, little revenue</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Infrastructure experts told us there isn&rsquo;t necessarily a formula for comparing state road quality.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;States vary slightly by how they define their pavement conditions,&quot; said Hussain Bahia, director of the Modified Asphalt Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, in an email.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We wanted to explore the evidence anyway.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Hoagenson&rsquo;s tweet, which included a graphic listing the percentage of rural roads in poor condition by state, citing the <a href=\"http://www.tripnet.org/images/Rural_Roads_Top_25_States_TRIP_Infographic_June_2017.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">TRIP 2017 Rural Roads Report</a>. Rural roads make up 82 percent of the state&rsquo;s total but cost less to maintain than major roadways.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hoagenson specified that Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest<em>.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Midwest region contains 12 states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Missouri had a Midwest region high of 21 percent of rural roads in poor condition in the report. Missouri and Washington tied for 11th nationwide.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;So it can be derived that we have some of the worst roads in the country,&quot; Hoagenson said in an email.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The American Society of Civil Engineers issues a national infrastructure report card every four years and assigns letter grades on 16 infrastructure categories, including roads.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>There are some state-level report cards, but these report cards are based on data compiled by a volunteer state-level committee, which is overseen by a national committee, said Greg DiLoreto, chair of the society&rsquo;s committee on America&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Not every state has such a committee in place, and DiLoreto made it clear it does not rank categories or states.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Missouri received a C- for overall infrastructure in 2018 and a D+ for roads, with 24 percent of the state&rsquo;s public roads considered to be in poor condition.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Wisconsin, which did not receive a letter grade, was the worst in the Midwest, with 27 percent of its public roads in poor condition.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Some of the least maintained roads in the nation are in the Northeast: 54 percent of public roads in Rhode Island are in poor condition; Connecticut&rsquo;s roads are at 57 percent.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Wisconsin was the only Midwestern state to edge Missouri in how much it costs motorists to drive on bad roads, also computed by the engineering society. Wisconsin&rsquo;s figure is an extra $637 per motorist per year. Missouri&rsquo;s $604 is second-highest in the region.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Prompted by Hoagenson, we tried another way of looking at rural road quality: the road maintenance funding ratio.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www2.modot.org/guidetotransportation/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen&rsquo;s Guide to Transportation</a>, produced by the Missouri Department of Transportation, the state has the seventh-largest road system in the country at 33,856 miles, and it ranks 46th nationally in revenue per mile.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>To Hoagenson, that&rsquo;s very lopsided.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>More roads, less maintenance makes sense as at least one measure, according to William Buttlar, chair of MU&rsquo;s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In 2016, Missouri spent $13,379 per state-controlled mile on road maintenance disbursements and $2,024 on administrative disbursements, according to a report sponsored by the nonprofit, non-partisan Reason Foundation on state highway performance.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Maintenance spending was 12th-lowest in the country and administrative spending second-lowest, next to Kentucky. In the Midwest, South Dakota and North Dakota had smaller maintenance disbursements than Missouri.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>One more measure that Buttlar pointed out was the International Roughness Index. The index measures the impact of a road&rsquo;s roughness on a vehicle&rsquo;s suspension; the lower the IRI, the better the road. Missouri&rsquo;s IRI data show 19.58 percent of roads considered not &quot;good&quot; or &quot;acceptable,&quot; the third-highest proportion in the Midwest and the 26th-highest in the country.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hoagenson claimed that &quot;Missouri has the worst roads in the Midwest and nearly the worst roads in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Missouri did not rank worst in the Midwest on metrics we looked at except besides Hoagenson&rsquo;s chosen graphic. That was only for the state&rsquo;s rural roads.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>None of the measures, though, paints a smooth ride for Missouri&rsquo;s roads. The state ranked near the bottom of the Midwest in nearly all important measures and fell in the bottom half of most rankings nationally. So, Hoagenson has a point that the state&rsquo;s roads need work.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>For those reasons, we rate this claim Half-True.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-04T23:30:33.493024", "ruling_date": "2018-10-04T23:24:59", "ruling_headline": "Hoagenson partially right on Missouri's poor road quality", "ruling_headline_slug": "hoagenson-partially-right-missouris-poor-road-qual", "ruling_link_text": "State ranks near the bottom", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange with Renee Hoagenson for Congress, Sept. 12, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with William Buttlar, chair of MU&#39;s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Sept. 17, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Hussain Bahia, director of the Modified Asphalt Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, Sept. 21, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Mike Schupp, area engineer for MoDOT, Sept. 18, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Greg DiLoreto, chair of ASCE Committee on America&rsquo;s Infrastructure, Sept. 27, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact.
