Chase Burnett, the bill&rsquo;s namesake, was found dead in March in a hot tub at his Fayette County home, a packet of the drugs nearby. He was 16. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bill passed with overwhelming support. On March 27, Gov. Nathan Deal signed it into law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA press release warned of synthetic marijuana&rsquo;s dangers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;As the usage has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it,&quot; it said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;ve heard that the drug is nasty stuff. But what&rsquo;s this about violence, bodily harm and death?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Deal spokeswoman sent PolitiFact Georgia news stories and poison control data to prove the governor&rsquo;s point. We also talked to researchers and law enforcement officials and reviewed news stories and scientific studies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe form of synthetic marijuana that&rsquo;s sparking so much concern is sold at head shops and gas stations under brand names such as &quot;Spice&quot; and &quot;K2.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGeorgia made it a felony to manufacture and sell it in 2010. Chase&rsquo;s Law tries to keep underground chemists from tweaking their recipes to get around state restrictions. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s little scholarly research on the drug, which appears to be new to the U.S.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFederal labs first detected these drugs in November 2008, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The earliest U.S. news story we found about its rising popularity appeared in a Hutchinson &nbsp;Kan., newspaper in November 2009.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll signs suggest that synthetic marijuana use is increasing dramatically, but data is in short supply.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorkers at the American Association of Poison Control Centers began <a href=\"http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/Portals/0/Synthetic%20Marijuana%20Data%20for%20Website%203.15.2012.pdf\">tracking</a> synthetic marijuana calls in 2010 after they noticed more inquiries, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2010, they received 2,906 &nbsp;calls; in 2011, there were 6,959.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout <a href=\"http://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/monitoring-future/overview-findings-2011\">11 percent of high school seniors reported using</a> synthetic marijuana in the past year, according to <a href=\"http://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/monitoring-future\">2011 results</a> of an annual survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It was the first time researchers asked about the drug.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExisting data support Deal&rsquo;s claim that reports of bodily harm have climbed. Georgia Poison Center call data show 10 users were admitted to a hospital&rsquo;s critical care unit in 2010 after using the drug. Forty-five were admitted in 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRapid heartbeat, agitation, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations and nausea were among the drug&rsquo;s most common effects, researchers have found. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedia accounts report drug users injured in car crashes, falls and other accidents -- some fatal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether synthetic marijuana is directly responsible for deaths -- and whether they&rsquo;re increasing -- is a more complicated issue. We found no published studies on the drug&rsquo;s lethality, but there have been &quot;scattered reports of deaths,&quot; said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan professor who conducted the National Institute on Drug Abuse survey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA count of news stories suggests there are more deadly cases. But whether the drug is a direct cause or contributing factor is not clear in some instances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsider Burnett&rsquo;s death. Toxicology tests are still in the works. Whether the official cause of death was drowning, the drug or something else is unsettled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told PolitiFact Georgia of two other recent deaths:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Two chemicals used in synthetic marijuana were found in the system of a man, 43, who died Sept. 8 in Cherokee County. The official cause of death was chronic high blood pressure.</li>\r\n\t<li>Toxicology results are pending in the Feb. 20 death of a 26-year-old Clarke County man. Police found two packages of synthetic marijuana on his bathroom sink, one partially used. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We found other accounts of synthetic marijuana-related deaths. For example, a South Carolina coroner ruled that it was directly responsible for the October death of a college basketball player who collapsed during warm-up, according to multiple news accounts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact Georgia found less support for Deal&rsquo;s claim about violence. We found no published studies on the subject. News stories, however, suggest there&rsquo;s cause for concern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>In September, a Bulloch County man told emergency dispatchers he and his girlfriend smoked Spice and it made him act &quot;crazy,&quot; a sheriff&rsquo;s report said. When deputies arrived, they found him holding his girlfriend, who was bloody and beaten. He said he attacked her.</li>\r\n\t<li>In 2010, an 18-year-old Iowa man fatally shot himself after smoking the drug.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo sum up:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvidence supports Deal&rsquo;s claim that use of the drug has &quot;dramatically increased,&quot; as has synthetic marijuana-related &quot;bodily harm.&quot; Some evidence suggests that deaths have risen, too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases it&rsquo;s hard to tell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeal&rsquo;s statement could use clarification. Still, it earns a Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-06T16:12:32.409651", "ruling_date": "2012-04-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Deal: Fake marijuana use rising, connected to death, violence and \"bodily harm\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "deal-fake-marijuana-use-rising-connected-death-vio", "ruling_link_text": "No half-baked claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Office of Gov.
