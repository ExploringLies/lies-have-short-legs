We&rsquo;ll take them in order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The bill&rsquo;s provisions won&rsquo;t be taking effect in time for the April 2018 filing season</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t anything in the tax bill that would take effect soon enough to change taxpayers&rsquo; filing choices in any significant way by April 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill&rsquo;s provisions only address tax year 2018 and beyond. So in April, taxpayers will be filing their paperwork for tax year 2017 to the IRS -- that is, under existing tax law, not the new law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most people will still be filing something that looks familiar to them from past years,&quot; said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There is no &lsquo;postcard&rsquo; filing plan for individual taxpayers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t a postcard filing option today, and there&rsquo;s nothing in the bill that would create one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea didn&rsquo;t come from nowhere. In November, House Republicans touted their plan as one that could be accommodated by a postcard-sized form. The president liked the idea so much that he held one up and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/11/03/561712483/gops-dream-postcard-size-tax-return\">kissed it</a> for the cameras when meeting with lawmakers at the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s going to make life very simple,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/02/republicans-say-you-will-file-your-taxes-with-a-postcard-if-new-bill-passes.html\">he said on Nov. 2, 2017</a>. The only people that aren&#39;t going to like this is H&amp;R Block. They&#39;re not going to be very happy. That&#39;s probably one of the only companies in the country that&#39;s not going to be thrilled.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the end, the bill didn&#39;t do much to make this idea a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The possibility of creating a postcard option &quot;is most likely one of many things the IRS will have to figure out and issue new regulations on,&quot; said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. But that&rsquo;s not happening immediately, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newton said that there is already a pretty easy way to file your tax returns -- the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1040ez--2016.pdf\">1040EZ form</a>. It looks like this, with just one page to fill out:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While it&rsquo;s not postcard-sized, it&rsquo;s pretty simple, and whatever they end up with in the future will probably look a lot like that currently does,&quot; Newton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1040EZ is also popular. According to <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/soi-a-inpd-id1703.pdf\">IRS statistics</a> for the 2015 tax year, 23.3 million tax filers used the 1040EZ. That&rsquo;s about one of every six filers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could the number of people using the 1040EZ increase due to the tax bill&rsquo;s passage (albeit in 2019)? Rosenberg said the number might increase on the margins due to the raising of the standard deduction, which would save some taxpayers from itemizing -- something they would have to do on the full 1040 form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, he added, &quot;there are relatively few people who currently itemize who have a simple enough situation&quot; to shift to the 1040EZ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trump&rsquo;s walk-back</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted the White House, they referred us to a tweet sent by Ivanka Trump a few hours after her <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> interview..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump replied to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mirandayaver/status/943853218412617738\">tweet</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mirandayaver\">Miranda Yaver</a>, a self-described Democratic political scientist, that said, &quot;Actually,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump\"> @IvankaTrump</a>, in April 2018 people will be doing their their 2017 taxes based on the current law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/943914421847457797\">replied</a>, &quot;Correct! All across America people will be thinking about how cumbersome the old tax code is &amp; energized about upcoming simplification!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That may happen, but it doesn&rsquo;t make her original remark correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ivanka Trump tweeted that in April, &quot;the vast majority will be (filling out their taxes) on a single postcard.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not the case. The recently passed bill takes effect for the 2018 tax year, which people will be filing returns on in April 2019 -- not this coming April. And there is no plan for a postcard filing option. Simple filing options already exist and are widely used, but tax experts do not expect a surge in their use as a result of the tax bill in April 2019.
