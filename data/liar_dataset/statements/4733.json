It includes an individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage in order to spread risk and costs across the population. That provision in particular is the subject of numerous court challenges and is the least popular aspect of the law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviewer Mark Wilson pointed to that fact in the Nov. 1, 2011, interview, noting &quot;54 percent of Americans favor repealing some version some part of that law. As you know, Florida leads the way in repealing it. What would you do differently now with regards to health care reform, knowing what we know now?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama responded by touting some of the law&rsquo;s benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well, look, keep in mind a million young people around the country have health care that didn&#39;t have it before because they can stay on their parents&rsquo; health care plan. Millions of families all across the country benefited from additional drug benefits as a consequence of that health care plan,&quot; the president said. &quot;Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get health care next year because of that law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;next year&quot; part of that struck us as suspect, so we decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law and its many provisions are designed to take effect in steps over a period of years. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a <a href=\"http://healthreform.kff.org/Timeline.aspx\">timeline </a>posted on its website explaining the phase-in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe changes set to take effect in 2012 mainly involve payments to Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe individual mandate, along with Medicaid expansion and establishment of the insurance exchanges, doesn&#39;t kick in until 2014. Those are the provisions of the law expected to give millions of Americans access to health insurance, and thus health care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12033/12-23-SelectedHealthcarePublications.pdf\">estimates </a>that next year only about 1 million more Americans will gain health insurance. The figure balloons to 19 million in 2014, and 30 million in 2016 when those concrete changes are fully implemented.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tParts of the law already up and running -- which have chipped away at the number of uninsured Americans -- include policies for people with pre-existing conditions and an allowance for young adults to remain on their parents&rsquo; health plans up to age 26.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the White House what Obama&rsquo;s &quot;next year&quot; claim was based on but did not hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, as we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/barack-obama/obama-ad-claims-credit-millions-gaining-health-car/\">noted before</a>, the individual mandate faces a significant battle in the courts and is likely to end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. If it is ruled unconstitutional, the CBO <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/113xx/doc11379/Eliminate_Individual_Mandate_06_16.pdf\">projects </a>that 16 million fewer people will become insured. Other studies put that reduction at between 8 million and 24 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama said &quot;Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO, a nonpartisan source, predicts only 1 million people will benefit in 2012, with the significant increases coming in 2014 and 2016. Plus, the law&rsquo;s future is uncertain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president is understandably enthusiastic about seeing his signature legislation take effect. But he misstated the timing of how many people will gain health insurance and when. It&rsquo;s not happening next year. We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-03T16:57:55.860645", "ruling_date": "2011-11-03T17:35:54", "ruling_headline": "Obama says health law will kick in for millions next year", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-says-health-law-will-kick-millions-next-year", "ruling_link_text": "Not so fast, Mr. President", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFox 13 <a href=\"http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/local/fox-13-interviews-president-barack-obama-11012011\">interview</a> of Barack Obama, Nov. 1, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://healthreform.kff.org/Timeline.aspx\">Implementation Timeline</a>, accessed on Nov. 2, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12033/12-23-SelectedHealthcarePublications.pdf\">Estimated Effects of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Reconciliation Proposal Combined with H.R. 3590 as Passed by the Senate</a>&quot; March 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCBO, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/113xx/doc11379/Eliminate_Individual_Mandate_06_16.pdf\">Effects of Eliminating the Individual Mandate to Obtain Health Insurance</a>,&quot; June 16, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/barack-obama/obama-ad-claims-credit-millions-gaining-health-car/\">Obama ad claims credit for millions gaining health care</a>,&quot; Nov. 2, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Fox television interview", "statement_date": "2011-11-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
