It typically peaks in Georgia by early January, with upticks after Thanksgiving and Christmas when germs are often passed like holiday feasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the main flu viruses that research suggests will be the most common of the season. This year&rsquo;s vaccines protect against three viruses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC develops its &quot;flu view&quot; map based on weekly reports from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico of outpatient visits to doctors for treatment of flu-like symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information is voluntarily submitted by doctors&rsquo; offices to their state public health departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>States on the CDC map are assigned to one of four levels of influenza-like illness activity -- minimal, low, moderate, or high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia was identified as having &quot;low&quot; flu activity in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, the most recent period for which outpatient information was available on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that was a notch above the rest of the nation, which this early in flu season fell in the minimal range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The biggest takeaway is the flu is here,&quot; said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health, &quot;and if you don&rsquo;t have a flu shot, you need to get one.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia did not report any hospitalizations or deaths due to the flu in that week, Nydam said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Carolina, meanwhile, had four flu deaths but showed up with less flu activity on the CDC map because the map -- again -- &nbsp;is based on how many people see a doctor, not how many die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s really misleading,&quot; Nydam said. &quot;The numbers (of patients with flu-like symptoms) are so low.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia <a href=\"https://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov/files/Immunizations/Flu/Weekly%20Flu%20Report%20402015.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reported</u></a> 22,273 patients visiting doctor&rsquo; offices in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, with 379 of those patients or 1.7 percent exhibiting flu-like symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare that to a report from a week in December 2014, when 20,835 people visited doctors, 1,643 or 7.89 percent with flu-like symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes come quickly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Georgia was identified as the state with the highest flu activity on Thursday, it was a different story Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because on Friday the Georgia Department of Public Health had later, data from the week starting Oct. 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It showed Georgia&rsquo;s flu activity down in the minimal range, where the rest of the country had been the week before. (Of 25,876 patients, 355 or 1.37 percent had flu-like symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Carolina and Alaska jumped ahead of Georgia in activity, but they were just higher in the minimal range, Nydam said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC doesn&rsquo;t look at the flu activity in isolation, said Lynnette Brammer, CDC epidemiologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The map is just one of nine resources that the CDC uses to track increases in flu-like illnesses across the country, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You take a look at all those pieces, including laboratory data, and you can get a pretty complete picture of flu that comes in contact with health care systems,&quot; Brammer said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With flu, you should never look at just one piece.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors report cases where patients complain of flu-like symptoms -- fever, cough or sore throat, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That flu-like illness may have been flu or may not have been,&quot; Brammer said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ruling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia had the highest flu activity in the country based on data provided by doctors offices across the country and mapped by the CDC for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That information factors into the CDC&rsquo;s efforts to track what goes on through flu season. But it&rsquo;s based on data submitted voluntarily and that, as we have seen, can change week -to-week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s important context that downgrades the statement to Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-23T14:50:01.439819", "ruling_date": "2015-10-26T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Georgia briefly tops chart for flu reports", "ruling_headline_slug": "georgia-briefly-tops-chart-flu-reports", "ruling_link_text": "Is it time to get your flu shot?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Center for Disease <a href=\"http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Control</u></a> and Prevention &quot;flu view&quot; map for week 40 ending Oct. 10, 2015 and for week 41 ending Oct. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Georgia has <a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/georgia-has-highest-flu-activity-country/nn6yW/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>highest</u></a> flu activity in country&quot; WSB-TV, Oct, 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Georgia Has <a href=\"http://wrbl.com/2015/10/21/georgia-has-most-cases-of-flu-in-the-country-still-ranks-low-range/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Most</u></a> Cases of Flu in the Country, Still Ranks &lsquo;Low&rsquo; Range,&quot; WRBL , Oct. 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Georgia sees <a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/story/news/health/2015/10/21/georgia-sees-early-flu-activity/74352578/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>early</u></a> flu activity,&quot; WXIA-TV, Oct. 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Nancy Nydam, media relations manager, Georgia Department of Public Health</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Lynnette Brammer, epidemiologist, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Profile, Lynnette Brammer, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/federal-faces-lynnette-brammer/2013/03/11/7d109f12-8a89-11e2-98d9-\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CDC</u></a>, The Washington Post</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the 2015-2016 flu season, the CDC -- what you should <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/upcoming.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>know</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "federal agency", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Centers ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 3263, "last_name": "for Disease Control", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "centers-disease-control", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouette_33.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3263/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://cdc.com/"}, "statement": "<p><strong><strong>Georgia has the highest flu activity in the country.</strong></strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "map", "statement_date": "2015-10-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 161, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/161/", "subject": "Drugs", "subject_slug": "drugs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
