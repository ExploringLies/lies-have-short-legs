Roy Cooper recently criticized House and Senate efforts to cut taxes, saying they overwhelmingly favor groups that need help the least &ndash; large corporations and millionaires. While Tillis recently <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tax-reform-transformed-north-carolina-congress-take-note-1505948613\">pointed to North Carolina</a> as a positive example for change, Cooper highlighted what he said were the negative consequences of the state tax code and said Congress&rsquo; efforts seem &quot;eerily familiar&quot; in his state. The tax reform efforts in NC and in Washington have <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article187624828.html\">divided local Republicans and Democrats</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unfortunately, decisions made by the Republican state legislature have left too many middle class families out of our state&rsquo;s economic growth,&quot; Cooper wrote in a Nov. 30 op-ed published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@NC_Governor/washingtons-tax-scheme-looks-eerily-familiar-d827ce5cbb13\">Medium.com</a>. &quot;Those decisions rigged the system to let those at the top reap most of the rewards.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Republicans, he said, are charting the same course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In total, it is estimated that half of the tax breaks in this proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent,&quot; Cooper wrote. &quot;The Joint Committee on Taxation shows that, on average, taxpayers earning $75,000 or less would end up paying more in taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact&rsquo;s recent <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/30/thom-tillis/nc-sen-tillis-says-plan-wont-raise-taxes-americans/\">fact-check of Tillis</a> shows that Cooper is partly right about taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 a year, but he left out the fact that most Americans would get a tax cut initially. Experts say that, by 2027, the Senate plan will leave them paying more in taxes, barring further changes in law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/nov/28/house-and-senate-tax-bills-overview/\">here</a>. Unlike Tillis, Cooper didn&rsquo;t single out one of the plans. Instead he spoke generally about how &quot;this proposal&quot; would affect the wealthiest Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The plan changes by year</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact reached out to Cooper for clarification. Ford Porter, his spokesman, cited analyses of each plan by the nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/about\">Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tax Policy Center (let&rsquo;s call it the TPC) found that the Senate plan gives 61.8 percent of the tax cuts to the top 1 percent &quot;once the cuts are phased-in,&quot; Porter said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Their analysis of the House bill showed 47 percent (of the cuts) going to the top 1 percent,&quot; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Porter is right. But key words to consider are &quot;once the cuts are phased in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report shows that estimates don&rsquo;t bear out Cooper&rsquo;s claim until 2027, because that&rsquo;s when many of the deductions for lower-income Americans are phased-out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, the center says the top 1 percent would get 17.6 percent of the Senate plan&rsquo;s total federal tax change, a share that would rise to 22 percent in 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Porter acknowledges that distinction in his email. But Cooper&rsquo;s op-ed failed to elaborate on his claim, which isn&rsquo;t true if examined in the years prior to 2027.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Change, in dollars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does that look like in financial terms? The <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/about-us/\">Tax Foundation</a> is a conservative-leaning nonprofit organization that examines the link between tax policies and the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://files.taxfoundation.org/20171110174950/Tax_Foundation_SR240-Sen-TCJA.pdf\">foundation found</a> that, under the Senate plan, the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would initially keep 1.1 to 1.9 percent more of their income. America&rsquo;s wealthiest &ndash; the one-percenters &ndash; would initially keep about 7.5 percent more of their money because of cuts to the corporate tax rate, as well as the income tax rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2027, things change for the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers. The foundation estimates they&rsquo;ll keep just 0.3 to 0.4 percent more. The top 1 percent, however, would keep 4.5 percent more compared to today&rsquo;s rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TPC has a similar analysis. The center says that in 2019, the Senate plan would cut taxes by an average of $900 for taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $87,000 a year. The average tax cut for the top 1 percent would be $34,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House bill similarly phases-out deductions for lower-income Americans, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate for the TPC. In the House bill, for example, &quot;there&rsquo;s a $300 child and family credit that expires after five years at the end of 2022. That would be for a family of four, that would be a $1,200 tax credit,&quot; Rosenberg said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2027, the analysis says those middle-income taxpayers would get cuts of less than 0.1 percent while the average &quot;one-percenters&quot; would still enjoy taxes that are 1.4 percent lower than they are right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cooper said half of the tax breaks in Senate Republicans&rsquo; proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. If key changes in the plan remain temporary, Cooper&rsquo;s claim would come to fruition, but not for 10 years. Cooper&rsquo;s op-ed doesn&rsquo;t explain that change. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-12-05T17:06:37.976396", "ruling_date": "2017-12-05T17:08:17", "ruling_headline": "NC governor cherry-picks stats showing tax breaks for wealthiest 1 percent", "ruling_headline_slug": "nc-governor-cherry-picks-stats-showing-tax-breaks-", "ruling_link_text": "The claim doesn't bear out until 2027", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Op-ed by North Carolina Gov.
