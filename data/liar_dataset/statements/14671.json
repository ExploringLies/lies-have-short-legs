The highest rate per capita in the country, according to FBI crime statistics.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Did Hegseth get that right?

Experts we talked to suggested St. Louis most likely has one of the highest crime rates per capita in the country, but they didn&rsquo;t give us a definitive answer.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m certain that St. Louis was near the top, but figuring out its exact rank requires arraying all cities of a certain size by their violent crime rate,&quot; said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The data Hegseth cited in his claim is readily available, so we did the math ourselves.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Crime.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Uniform Crime Reporting</a>&nbsp;(UCR) collects and compares reported crime data by city, county, state and nation. A violent crime is defined as a murder, rape, robbery or aggravated assault.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-8/table-8-state-pieces/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_missouri_by_city_2015.xls\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Missouri crime statistics</a>, there were 5,762 violent crimes and 188 murders in the city of St. Louis.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We checked Hegseth&rsquo;s claim by creating a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgMKvQhw-AT8kXaGRew2bmkic97_haaTCP-BDl-Ud68/edit#gid=1586870024\" target=\"_blank\">database</a>&nbsp;using UCR&rsquo;s data, which lists 2015 crime data for every state and city.

That year, St. Louis came in second for violent crimes per 100,000. Detroit ranked No. 1. We ran the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1Yst26Tnh4rVmVHZmZRTzNzUG8/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">same calculations</a>&nbsp;on the most recent data, too.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>As for the homicide rate, St. Louis held its No. 1 spot in 2016.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2016/10/01/most-dangerous-cities-america/91227778/\" target=\"_blank\">A USA Today article</a>&nbsp;also breaks down the per capita statistics, citing&nbsp;<a href=\"http://247wallst.com/special-report/2016/09/27/25-most-dangerous-cities-in-america/\" target=\"_blank\">24/7 Wall Street</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;Adjusting for population, the city&rsquo;s murder and violent crime rates, at 59 murders and 1,817 per 100,000 city residents, are each the highest in the country,&quot; the article states.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In cities with a population of at least 100,000 people, St. Louis had both the highest violent crime rate per capita and murder rate per capita in the country in 2015.

He said if you combined the county crime data with the city&rsquo;s, St. Louis&rsquo; crime rate would drop drastically.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Experts say Dotson has a point.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, told us previously that suburbs have a moderating effect on crime data, so crime rate can depend on whether and how many suburbs are included in the city&rsquo;s jurisdiction. In this case, the city&rsquo;s crime rate does not reflect any of the 90 municipalities or unincorporated parcels that make up St. Louis County.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth said St. Louis had the highest crime rate and highest homicide rate per capita in the country in 2015, according to UCR data.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hegseth cites the data correctly. But experts caution against using crime data to compare cities. In St. Louis&rsquo; case, its high crime rate is at least partially explained because the St. Louis suburbs are not part of the city proper.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hegseth&rsquo;s claim is accurate but needs that point of clarification.
