Cole said on his March 31, 2014, morning show, &quot;They told us that the annual amount to operate this thing&rsquo;s going to be about $2.5 million. Last year ... it cost $13 million to operate it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the 32-mile Red Line costing five times more than expected?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worth bearing in mind: As we noted in a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/apr/25/clay-dafoe/clay-dafoe-says-austin-bus-riders-subsidize-commut/\"> <u>2012 fact-check</u></a>, the commuter train isn&rsquo;t supposed to pay for itself; it&rsquo;s considered a public service. Capital Metro opened the diesel-powered MetroRail service to passengers in March 2010, has expanded it somewhat and<a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/big-changes-ahead-for-capital-metro-train-tracks-s/ncsMG/\"> <u>plans a major overhaul</u></a> to provide more capacity -- the trains are mostly packed during rush hour, as we explored in a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/feb/08/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-austin-trains-are-full-rush-h/\"> <u>2013 fact-check</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, MetroRail is separate from a proposed electric-powered urban passenger rail line, decades in the making, that the City of Austin might take to voters in November 2014 for authorization of several hundred million dollars in bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cole&#39;s backup information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big electric-rail proposals like that, Cole told us by phone, are why he initially supported MetroRail, a smaller diesel-train project on existing freight track -- as a less-costly way to test the waters. He was later dismayed, he said, to see MetroRail&rsquo;s costs exceed Capital Metro&rsquo;s initial predictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cole told us he drew his dollar amounts from memory, having tracked the project since before voters approved it in November 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Capital Metro cost calculations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no instances of Capital Metro giving a $2.5 million annual operating costs figure, or any estimate other than $5 million, in 2004.<strong> </strong>Then again, that $5 million estimate included $3 million a year for lease-purchase of the required rail cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone and email, Capital Metro spokeswoman Francine Pares told us something surprising: The 2004 estimate solely covered the expected cost of a rail contractor, including service delivery, dispatching, supervision, vehicle maintenance and right-of-way maintenance. She said the estimate left out costs including &quot;fuel, track maintenance, bridge maintenance, signal maintenance, communication system maintenance, signal crossing maintenance, inspections&quot; and &quot;administrative costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;full system had not been designed yet, so no estimates could be made as to how the full system would be built out,&quot; Pares wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pares stressed, too, the estimate emerged six years before trains started running and before how often trains run was stepped up. A timeline she provided indicated the trains, originally penciled in to have 5,100 service hours a year, are projected to exceed 14,200 service hours in the fiscal year through September 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Operating costs have increased as the inflation, labor, fuel and service hours have increased each year,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before voters acted in 2004, Capital Metro issued an estimate of likely operating costs without specifying what the estimate left out:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From August 2004 Capital Metro<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5ZVlOTFpTMURodTQ/edit?usp=sharing\"> <u>presentation</u></a>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pdEh9Ezh4vOxvdLJnPR07e2T3aJORFqWGb3xhJ2zjOKnZAHkdohAtka3ilJ0YgWTBbR4rA6qtjLID3YlAmoM5DJKFuMwyVAtFIsj-08OqsqkHGLXlJfMHI267PifvpWI6A\" style=\"height:299px; width:401px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Accounting for rail cars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the rail cars: Before the November 2004 vote, an Aug. 17, 2004, <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgbIg6elpBox2MPVWJ6oNZJI3-FOLQMSwBXNxYHtrnc/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>news story</u></a> reported details of the final recommended version of the $60 million plan. On operating costs, the story said, &quot;Not included in the $60 million is the upfront cost of the six self-propelled hybrid-diesel rail cars the agency thinks it would need initially to provide rush-hour service at 30-minute intervals when the line opens in 2007 or 2008. Those cars would probably cost about $3 million a year for a lease-purchase. Even including that lease cost, Capital Metro estimates initial annual operating costs of $5 million,&quot; the story said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That $5 million in 2004, <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl\"><u>adjusting for inflation,</u></a> projects out to $5.8 million in 2010 dollars and $6.2 million in 2013 dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after the 2004 vote, Capital Metro decided to buy the train cars instead of leasing to own and took out a loan in 2006 for the purchase. <em>Statesman</em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgbIg6elpBox2MPVWJ6oNZJI3-FOLQMSwBXNxYHtrnc/edit?usp=sharing\"> <u>news stories</u></a> in 2008 and <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/cap-metro-considers-borrowing-20-million-for-new-1/nRhFt/\"><u>2011</u></a> said the agency was spending $4.4 million a year in debt payments on the loan<strong> </strong>(comparable to the $3 million annual lease-purchase payments projected in 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cole said that because of that change, &quot;they no longer include the train cost in operating (costs),&quot; and the figures of $2.5 million and $13 million that he gave on the air were operating costs that excluded the lease or purchase costs of the train cars. If he&rsquo;d included the car payments, Cole said, he&rsquo;d have been able to say annual operating costs went from a projected $5 million to actual $15 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MetroRail costs from 2011 on</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Costs have gone up, Capital Metro&#39;s Pares said, as have service hours. By email, she sent figures from fiscal 2011 -- the line&rsquo;s first full fiscal year of service, ending Sept. 30, 2011 -- through the actual costs for 2013 and the projected amount budgeted for fiscal 2014:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>2011</strong>: 10,731 train service hours. Direct operating costs $9.1 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $4.4 million; total $13.5 million.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>2012</strong>: 11,502 train service hours. Direct operating costs $10.3 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $1.7 million; total $12 million.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>2013</strong>: 11,466 train service hours. Actual operating expenses $10.5 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $2.9 million; total $13.4 million. (Direct operating costs were still being finalized, Pares said.)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>2014</strong>: 14,100 train projected service hours. Operating budget $12.6 million; principal and interest payments on train car loan $2.9 million; total $15.5 million.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with the car lease or loan payments included, Capital Metro originally estimated $5 million operating costs, which projects out to $6.2 million in 2013 dollars. The agency ultimately spent $13.4 million to operate the line and make debt payments on the rail cars in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excluding the car payments, 2004&rsquo;s estimate was $2 million (equal to $2.5 million in 2013 dollars)<strong> </strong>and 2013&rsquo;s costs were $10.5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some context: In an April 22, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/report-slaps-capital-metro/nRsHF/\"><u>news story</u></a>, the <em>Statesman</em> reported that a <a href=\"https://www.sunset.texas.gov/\"><u>Texas Sunset Advisory Commission</u></a> report found mismanagement at Capital Metro, including poor planning that caused MetroRail to cost $140 million plus $8 million in loan interest on the cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MetroRail&rsquo;s financial picture subsequently improved. In December 2011, the agency reduced its car payments by <a href=\"http://www.capmetro.org/uploadedFiles/Capmetroorg/About_Us/Finance_and_Audit/CAFR2012_final.pdf\"><u>refinancing</u></a> the loan, and a Feb. 3, 2013, <em>Statesman </em><a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/weekend-metrorail-a-now-and-then-hit/nWFB8/\"><u>news story</u></a> said that, thanks largely to a $9 million federal grant, &quot;the commuter line is much closer to covering its $14.5 million annual operating cost than in its first two years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Cole, Capital Metro originally said MetroRail annual operating costs &quot;would be about $2.5 million. &hellip; last year, it cost $13 million to operate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s correct, even conservative, on the 2013 costs. But Cole understates MetroRail&rsquo;s initial projected operating costs of $5 million, or $6.2 million in 2013 dollars, which Capital Metro told us didn&rsquo;t roll in fuel and other costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rail line&rsquo;s 2013 operating costs, including payments on the rail-car loan, were about $13 million--more than double the inflation-adjusted 2004 estimate, perhaps in part due to trains having more service hours than initially envisioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Cole&rsquo;s statement as Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>HALF TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash;
