Two days later, she was handed a proposed 2004 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a balanced budget because by law, it had to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in two of the county&rsquo;s largest funds, the general fund and the special services district fund, the original budget planners saw spending topping revenues by a combined total of nearly $90 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They didn&rsquo;t call those deficits; they called them shortfalls. But the concept is similar. Additional shortfalls in other funds added well over $10 million to the gap, giving us the $100 million &quot;deficit&quot; in Handel&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep the budget balanced, that original plan took $12 million from the county&rsquo;s cash reserves (to boost the general fund) and raised property taxes by about $75 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, the difference is not that Handel took an unbalanced budget and fixed it. Rather, she took a different approach to balancing the budget &mdash; which, again, by law, the commission had to do each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FcSu44FQyHDXDAaMkMl_FtQ8gp_PAaUN67jx5p9_0iY\">news reports in January 2004</a>, Handel gets credit for using a mix of spending cuts and deeper draws into cash reserves to deliver a balanced budget that avoided a property tax increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, her budget plan reduced spending by $46 million from the plan she saw when she took office. But that still didn&rsquo;t close the gap between spending and revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gap was half of what she started with. She filled that gap, not with more property taxes, but with money saved from past years and kept in reserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the words of a Jan. 22, 2004, Atlanta Journal Constitution <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FcSu44FQyHDXDAaMkMl_FtQ8gp_PAaUN67jx5p9_0iY\">article</a>, &quot;The budget calls for $49 million in deficit spending that pulls Fulton&#39;s two savings accounts below commission-mandated minimums.&quot; (Ultimately, the funds didn&#39;t dip as low as expected.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spoke with Handel and her spokeswoman Kate Constantini. They&nbsp;rejected the idea that her plan included a &quot;deficit&quot; but agreed with the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I came in and got the budget in place so we didn&#39;t need to raise taxes,&quot; Handel said. &quot;We did that through savings and realignment across the various funds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal Constitution praised her at the time. In an <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_V1QxVUZvdE1hWTlrdXRIeGw0Y0taNlI5OUww\">editorial</a>, it called her plan &quot;reasonable and even handed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In this era of cruel budget-cutting in the face of dropping revenue, it&rsquo;s a rare opportunity to adopt a spending plan that supports good services but doesn&rsquo;t soak the taxpayers,&quot; it said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Handel said she turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget when she became chair of the Fulton County board of commissioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain parts of that story add up: The expected shortfall was over $100 million. Handel&rsquo;s budget was balanced, and did so without a tax increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, her talking point omits that the county required balanced budgets &mdash; and the spending plan she was handed was balanced in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, if Handel called the $100 million in the original plan a deficit, then the same label would apply to the 2004 budget that she spearheaded. Her balanced plan also factored in a $49 million shortfall, even after spending cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest difference is she avoided a hefty tax hike by drawing more from reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Words matter. Handel&rsquo;s statement ignores that she was required to balance the budget, and her definition of deficit is inconsistent. We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-14T12:55:27.932152", "ruling_date": "2017-04-14T12:55:43", "ruling_headline": "Karen Handel makes dicey balanced budget claim in Georgia race to replace Tom Price", "ruling_headline_slug": "karen-handels-dicey-balanced-budget-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Counties can't pass deficit budgets", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>11Alive News, <a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/news/politics/elections/ballot/race-to-replace-tom-price-karen-handel-touting-past-record/424256386\">Race to replace Tom Price: Karen Handel touting past record</a>, March 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karen Handel for Congress, <a href=\"https://karenhandel.com/about-karen/\">About Karen</a>, accessed April 12, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fulton County Department of Finance,<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_X0lia3MyLTgxWFYxOVhSQXdUWE1DZlEwQU84\"> 2004 budget proposal letter</a>, Nov. 14, 2003</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FcSu44FQyHDXDAaMkMl_FtQ8gp_PAaUN67jx5p9_0iY\">Fulton budget passed</a>, Jan. 22, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_V1QxVUZvdE1hWTlrdXRIeGw0Y0taNlI5OUww\">Editorial: approve sensible Fulton budget</a>, Jan. 14, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Karen Handel, congressional candidate, April 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Kate Constantini, spokeswoman, Handel for Congress, April 14, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Clint Mueller, legislative director, Association County Commissioners of Georgia, April 13, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Karen", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "", "id": 440, "last_name": "Handel", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "karen-handel", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/KarenHandel.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/440/", "total_count": 15, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;As chairman of the Fulton board of commissioners, I turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2017-03-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 171, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/171/", "subject": "County Budget", "subject_slug": "county-budget", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Karen Handel's dicey balanced budget claim requires more context"}
