The theater is emblematic of the triumphs. It opened in 1914 and <a href=\"http://cinematreasures.org/theater/11522/\">hosted legendary acts</a> such as Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald and Richmond native <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Robinson\">Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson</a>. After years of <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/74568056@N00/249398231/\">decay</a>, developers are turning the theater into a music hall. The project also includes apartments, retail space and restaurants, one of which is already open.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJones said it was &quot;fitting&quot; he was speaking in a &quot;venue which has sat empty for most of the last 40 years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mayor then boasted that there are &quot;$981 million, almost a billion dollars, in active development projects right here in the City of Richmond.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur daily commutes take us past many of the works and we wanted to find out if all those cranes really comprise $981 million in &quot;active&quot; projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTammy Hawley, the mayor&rsquo;s press secretary, sent us a project list that added up to $981.7 million in public and private investments. But she added some fine print. While Jones said the ventures were &quot;active,&quot; Hawley said the figure is actually based on projects &quot;we know about that are either recently completed, under construction or in the pipeline.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 28 listed projects range in value from $3 million to $158 million. Many of the largest public investments are improvements at Virginia Commonwealth University&rsquo;s Monroe Park campus and at the Medical College of Virginia, its hospital campus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe biggest project is a new school of medicine at VCU. The city&rsquo;s development office says that project will cost $158 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next-largest project, by dollar value, is the building of a new wing at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, which the city says cost $150 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResidents of the city&rsquo;s Museum District, where the VMFA is located, are hardly troubled by construction noise and dust, however. That&rsquo;s because the new wing opened on May 1, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe list of projects includes the $64.8 million Williams Mullen building on 10th Street in downtown. But the law firm opened for business at its new location on June 14, 2010, nearly nine months before the mayor&rsquo;s speech.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso listed &nbsp;are a $10 million expansion of the Virginia War Memorial and the $10.1 million refurbishment of the city&rsquo;s Manchester Courthouse. Both projects are completed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the city identifies two Jackson Ward apartment complexes--one targeted at VCU students and the other at the over-55 crowd. Both are completed and open to tenants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe counted $249.4 million in completed ventures that are on the city&rsquo;s list of &quot;active development projects.&quot; Cross them out and the value of active projects is actually $732.3 million. That&rsquo;s a 25.4 percent difference from the mayor&rsquo;s figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen there&rsquo;s the case of Crosland LLC&rsquo;s proposed &quot;Manchester on the James&quot; project for 200 apartments and parking at the southern end of the Lee Bridge. The city says it will cost $26.6 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe City Council approved the project in June 2008, stipulating the company must get a building permit within two years and begin construction no more than six months after that. The General Assembly has passed a law allowing a grace period for projects delayed because of the recent recession, so the project will not need further approvals before construction begins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo building permit has been issued for that site since 2008, when a demolition permit was issued. The demolition permit expired in October 2009.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review our findings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJones said in his speech that Richmond has &quot;$981 million in active development projects.&quot; His spokeswoman, when contacted a few days later, clarified that the number includes recently completed projects, sites where work is currently ongoing, and planned projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen completed works are excluded, the number of current or planned development deals falls to $732.3 million, 25.4 percent less than what the mayor cited. And another project, the $26.6 million Manchester on the James, is dormant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo doubt, Richmond has been developing in recent years and several major projects were successfully completed in 2010. But the mayor&rsquo;s number is not right; it paints a better picture than what exists. Therefore we rate the Jones&rsquo; claim Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
