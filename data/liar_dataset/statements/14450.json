Jon Tester, D-Mont.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government,&quot; Rosendale, Montana&#39;s state auditor,&nbsp;said in a July 31 interview on <em>Voices of Montana.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to investigate whether&nbsp;Tester supports a national gun registry. It turns out the&nbsp;opposite is true.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What is a national gun registry?</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned,&quot; said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/David-B.-Kopel/e/B000AP88JA\">authored</a> several books on gun control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era&rsquo;s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that&rsquo;s inconsistent with common parlance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Rosendale&rsquo;s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to &quot;the people of Montana,&quot; and Rosendale&rsquo;s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Rosendale&rsquo;s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Tester <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00319\">cast</a> in favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did that measure seek to establish a federal list of guns and their owners?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not even close.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">The campaign&rsquo;s attempt to paint the Feinstein amendment as a national gun registry is absurd, and here&rsquo;s why</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI&rsquo;s list to those on the U.S. government&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/national-security-branch/tsc/tsc\">consolidated terror watchlist</a> of known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rosendale campaign&rsquo;s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts dismissed the notion that to deny gun&nbsp;sales to the government&rsquo;s list of known and suspected terrorists, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/us/even-those-cleared-of-crimes-can-stay-on-fbis-terrorist-watch-list.html?mcubz=3\">flawed</a> as it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The terror watch list is not a gun registry,&quot; said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. &quot;In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign&rsquo;s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,&quot; Hemenway said. &quot;He doesn&#39;t seem to understand what a registry is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Rosendale&rsquo;s central claim is flat wrong &mdash; but he didn&rsquo;t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to &quot;ask permission from the federal government&quot; before they purchase a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim&rsquo;s absurdity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rosendale campaign said further that Tester&rsquo;s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However &mdash; leaving aside <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00094\">whether</a> <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00087\">these</a> <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00325\">bills</a> would have done that &mdash; the reality is that Tester&rsquo;s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Tester&rsquo;s opposition to a national gun registry</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tester <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00097\">voted for</a> the 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, which <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/obama-says-bipartisan-background-check-plan-outlaw/\">we previously found</a> would have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers who <a href=\"https://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/56cf760a-93b9-4e20-bb7f-0a7e59570e5f/20111103173517990.pdf\">pushed</a> for a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, and <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00208\">voted</a> in favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as <a href=\"http://missoulian.com/election2006/ongoing_election_coverage/burns-tester-find-common-ground-in-guns/article_38984fa8-1276-5489-b496-2fc2beff97c1.html\">2006</a> that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&nbsp;also co-signed a 2011 <a href=\"http://static.usnews.com/documents/whispers/unarmstreatyletter20110726.pdf\">letter</a> to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an &quot;international gun registry.&quot; For this, Tester earned <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20110722/us-senate-stands-with-nra-in-strongly\">praise</a> from the National Rifle Association for &quot;stand(ing) on the side of America&#39;s 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosendale said Tester &quot;believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tester&rsquo;s record shows opposition to a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and gun owners.
