We found the story about a senior stimulus after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network&rsquo;s efforts to combat fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake story says that to qualify for the stimulus, recipients must be over 65, retired, receive Social Security and have an income under $40,000 per year. &quot;The letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable,&quot; stated the article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article then directed readers to call the White House switchboard if they don&rsquo;t receive the letter. (The number printed in the article and it is indeed the switchboard.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaganwasright.com describes itself as a satirical website that uses &quot;humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people&rsquo;s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The about us page links to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thelastlineofdefense/\">Facebook page of America&rsquo;s Last Line of Defense</a>, which is run by Christopher Blair, a Maine man behind who we&rsquo;ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are carefully curated social experiment designed to &quot;feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re also a vehicle to make money. The point, of course, is to get someone on Facebook to click on the post thinking it is real. &quot;I discovered that Facebook following plus blog plus ads equals income,&quot; Blair told us previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the Reaganwasright Facebook post includes an innocuous headline, &quot;President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees,&quot; and a caption that asks people to share the post 1,000 times to show appreciation for Trump.
