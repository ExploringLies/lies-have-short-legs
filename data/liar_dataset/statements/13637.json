Cox, the chairman of the New York State Republican Committee, took exception when Gov. Andrew Cuomo said &quot;the exodus has stopped&quot; in New York state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He said there is no exodus, we&rsquo;ve stopped the exodus. Wrong &ndash; completely wrong,&quot; Cox said to reporters in Albany. &quot;The exodus of citizens from New York state has been growing, it&rsquo;s never been larger. That&rsquo;s an absolute fraudulent statement the governor made, that the net exodus of citizens from New York state has been stopped under his regime. Absolutely wrong. That&rsquo;s a lie and he knew it was.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Cox right? Are more people moving out of New York state than moving in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cuomo&rsquo;s comment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with Cox&#39;s statement, according to a Cuomo spokesman, is that Cox misinterpreted what the governor said during his regional State of the State address in Buffalo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo said:&nbsp;&quot;So we got the spending down. It allowed us to get the taxes down, and that&rsquo;s why you see a new attitude where businesses believe they&rsquo;re welcome in New York, families believe they&rsquo;re welcome in New York. The exodus has stopped, the job growth has started.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo&#39;s statement left room for interpretation, but PolitiFact New York evaluated that claim in July 2016 and rated it True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mWXRUweNP-Y-6H7A30mqC6hQ10vOJpdmmywX2aidGJA/pubchart?oid=1469237070&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: New York State Department of Labor</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Census data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox interpreted Cuomo&#39;s statement as about people. The U.S. Census Bureau tracks how many people move in and move from states each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between April 2010 and July 2016, the latest data available, 846,669 more people moved out of New York state than moved in. That&#39;s the largest outflow in the country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SF22qOAsgqOGMpJWrmeACQsdvWp1UfBmohWjSdPvsLo/pubchart?oid=1743813587&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: U.S. Census Bureau</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s population increased by 367,719 people in the same time period thanks to births and international migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo took office in January 2011. Leaving out&nbsp;data between July 2010 and July 2011 still leaves the state with a net domestic migration loss of about 723,000 between 2011 and 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exodus from New York state is not new. The trend goes back decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuomo and Cox are like ships passing in the night. Cuomo&#39;s statement was previously rated True.
