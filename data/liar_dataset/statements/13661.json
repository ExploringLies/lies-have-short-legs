In fact, every president except for William Harrison (who died a month into office) has issued at least one executive order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This specific presidential action directs the federal government and bureaucracies and carries the power of the law. However, executive orders can be revoked or amended by future presidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to settle the matter: Did Obama, unlike Trump, wait to take executive action? Long story short is that he didn&rsquo;t, and experts said executive actions are common among new presidents. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obama didn&rsquo;t waste much time before issuing executive orders after his inauguration.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama signed his first executive order (<a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=76782\">13489</a>) about presidential records on Jan. 21, 2009, a day after the inauguration. This executive order required the Archivist of the United States notify both the incumbent president and the former president of any records the archivist feels may trigger executive privilege. (Executive privilege refers to the president&rsquo;s power to withhold information from the public.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next 10 days, Obama had signed nine executive orders. By the end of his first month, the number was 16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how Obama compared to Trump: As of Jan. 26, Trump had <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements\">signed</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united\">four</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/executive-order-expediting-environmental-reviews-and-approvals-high\">executive</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/2/executive-order-minimizing-economic-burden-patient-protection-and\">orders</a> aimed at achieving various campaign promises. By this time, Obama had issued five executive orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama first aimed to limit access to<a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-26/pdf/E9-1712.pdf\"> presidential records</a>, while another <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-27/pdf/E9-1893.pdf\">ordered </a>the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba within one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That action received<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/177/close-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-center/\"> backlash from Republicans</a>. As did Obama&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-27/pdf/E9-1895.pdf\">corresponding order</a> to look for lawful alternatives to the detention of captives in the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Month</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Executive orders signed by Obama</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>January 2009 (starting on Jan. 21)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>9</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>February 2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>7</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>March 2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>April 2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html\">https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Executive action has a broad definition, but just in terms of one type of executive orders, Goldberg&rsquo;s claim is incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>That said, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether Trump&rsquo;s first actions as president are more significant for policy than Obama&rsquo;s.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Executive orders aren&rsquo;t the only action president&rsquo;s can take, making it difficult to compare Obama&rsquo;s use of unilateral actions to Trump&rsquo;s so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through &quot;executive actions,&quot; presidents can also pardon criminals, amend the internal structure of the executive branch, issue signing statements, write letters and memoranda, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The number of orders is often misleading, and the terminology can be confusing &mdash; both presidents issued important orders that were not &lsquo;Executive Orders&rsquo; with numbers attached,&quot; said John T. Woolley, an American politics professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that both Trump and Obama took controversial actions at the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The early Trump executive actions have been on hot button issues, so they aroused a lot of early controversy, but we can&rsquo;t forget how controversial presidential actions of the past have been,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Galston was specifically referring to the U.S. Treasury&rsquo;s decision to bail out the auto industry during Obama&rsquo;s first year. When Obama took office, he created a task force with a mandate to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/sep/06/did-obama-save-us-automobile-industry/\">determine the fate of GM and Chrysler</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that is not unlikely for presidents to take executive actions at first, especially when there&rsquo;s a change in party, adding that presidents want to reverse actions of the previous administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Trump issued a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/23/presidential-memorandum-regarding-mexico-city-policy\">presidential memorandum</a> on Jan. 23 that banned all foreign nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. funds from performing or promoting abortion, reversing an Obama action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recession gripping the country when Obama took office also spurred the former president to move with more urgent executive action, Galston said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldberg said Obama waited &quot;at least a couple of months&quot; to issue executive actions. That&rsquo;s not correct; Obama issued an executive order on his first day in office, and 16 with in his first month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it&rsquo;s hard to compare one president&rsquo;s actions to the other, experts said Trump and Obama both issued important orders in the beginning of their presidency, which is common practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee69d395-6457-4516-91b2-9055099e7528\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee69d395-6457-4516-91b2-9055099e7528</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-26T17:24:19.696041", "ruling_date": "2017-01-26T17:22:08", "ruling_headline": "Whoopi Goldberg wrongly says Obama waited \u2018at least a couple of months\u2019 to issue executive actions", "ruling_headline_slug": "whoopi-goldberg-wrongly-says-obama-waited-least-co", "ruling_link_text": "Obama signed an executive order one day in", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Phone &nbsp;interview, William Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Jan. 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, John Woolley, political science professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, Jan. 26, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/13/beto-orourke/texas-democrat-obama-offered-fewer-executive-actio/\">PolitiFact</a>, &quot;Texas Democrat: Obama &#39;offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president&rsquo;,&quot; July 13, 2104</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/23/presidential-memorandum-regarding-mexico-city-policy\">WhiteHouse.gov</a>, &quot;Presidential Memorandum Regarding the Mexico City Policy,&quot; Jan. 23, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html\">National archives</a>, &quot;2009 Executive Orders Signed by Barack Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/sep/06/did-obama-save-us-automobile-industry/\">PolitiFact</a>, &quot;Did President Obama save the auto industry?&quot; Sept. 6, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "The View co-host", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Whoopi ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New York ", "id": 1026, "last_name": "Goldberg", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "whoopi-goldberg", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 9, "party": "Talk show host", "party_slug": "talk-show-host", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/9/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/whoopi.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1026/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://theview.abc.go.com/"}, "statement": "<div>Says Barack Obama &quot;didn&rsquo;t do executive orders in the beginning.&quot;&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a segment on ABC's 'The View'", "statement_date": "2017-01-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Goldberg wrong about when Obama first took executive action"}
