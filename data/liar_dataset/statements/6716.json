Paul Ryan as his running mate unleashed a flood of partisan debate over Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia politicians are riding the rapids.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin congressman is the architect of a plan to overhaul Medicare that Democrats have widely attacked as a &quot;voucher system.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring an interview on CNN, Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta used a more delicate term: &quot;premium support.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Premium support is not vouchers,&quot; the co-chairman of the House Republican doctors caucus said Aug. 14.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A voucher would be, you hand money to a senior and say, &lsquo;Hey, go find your health care,&rsquo; &quot; he said. &quot;This would be run by the Medicare trustees. &hellip; The money would stay there.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo which one is it? &quot;Premium support&quot; or a voucher plan?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats have used the word &quot;voucher&quot; over the years to criticize Republican privatization proposals. Republicans don&#39;t like the word and try to avoid it<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National recently gave President Barack Obama a Mostly True when he said that Romney and Ryan &quot;want to turn Medicare into a voucher system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIts inquiry started with the dictionary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMerriam-Webster <a href=\"http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/voucher\">defines a voucher</a> as &quot;a written affidavit or authorization ... a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child&#39;s education in either a public or private school.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Premium support&quot; describes a concept that&rsquo;s been kicking around since the mid-1990s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHealth policy experts Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution and Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director, defined the term in a 1995 study. Versions of premium support have appeared in other proposals since then.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tBroadly speaking, these proposals would change Medicare from a program in which the government pays the health care provider for services directly to one in which the government designates money for a beneficiary to spend on an insurance plan.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe initial Ryan plan that used &quot;premium supports&quot; was released in early 2011. It was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what PolitiFact National has to say about this version:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this first version, for workers 55 and younger, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals for their services to one in which the government would designate a pot of money for each beneficiary to pay for private insurance premiums.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeneficiaries would have selected a plan from a group that complies with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which runs the health benefits program for federal employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe beneficiary would receive an amount based in part on the cost of the second-least-expensive plan available on the exchange.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent version of Ryan&rsquo;s plan has one key difference. He gave beneficiaries the option of selecting a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes this mean Ryan&rsquo;s plan is not a voucher system? Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber offered two main arguments to back up his statement:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>One: The government pays, not the senior</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Premium support means the senior picks from a list of government-approved plans and then the government pays the bill,&quot; Talaber said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis argument falls short. Early proponents of premium support did not consider this to be a defining characteristic of the system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven if they did, this type of approach would still fit the dictionary definition of &quot;voucher,&quot; which we described above.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Two: The amount of support would change to meet the rising cost of health care</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTalaber pointed us to a 2011 blog post written by Aaron, co-author of the study we mentioned above.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The defining attribute of the plans that Reischauer and I christened &lsquo;premium support&rsquo; was that the amount of support was to be indexed to average healthcare costs, not, as in voucher plans, to a price index or per person income,&quot; Aaron wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe difference is crucial, Aaron wrote: &quot;Voucher plans are virtually guaranteed to become increasingly inadequate; premium support plans will not.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAaron&rsquo;s blog post, however, does not prove Gingrey&rsquo;s point. As we mentioned above, Ryan&rsquo;s plan indexes premium supports to the second-least-expensive plan available in the exchange -- not average health care costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis difference opens Ryan&rsquo;s plan to reasonable criticism that it may not share premium support&rsquo;s defining characteristic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the interest of fairness, we considered other arguments on why Ryan&rsquo;s plan counts as premium support, not vouchers. Some backers of free-market reforms do think there&rsquo;s a substantive difference, although experts interviewed by PolitiFact National differ on how to classify Ryan&rsquo;s plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAaron himself told PolitiFact National that he thinks &quot;premium support is a type of voucher.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurther complicating the matter is that even among policy wonks, language tends to evolve over nearly two decades.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tRegardless, Ryan&rsquo;s plan fits the dictionary definition of &quot;voucher&quot; pretty well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrey&rsquo;s statement that &quot;premium support is not vouchers,&quot; has two main problems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s fair to argue that Ryan&rsquo;s plan lacks an essential feature of &quot;premium support&quot; -- being indexed to average health care costs. We think this is a crucial shortcoming.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurthermore, the claim draws distinctions that are too fine for a general audience -- and even some experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe give Gingrey a Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-16T17:32:18.998229", "ruling_date": "2012-09-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gingrey: Medicare reform plan does not create voucher system", "ruling_headline_slug": "gingrey-medicare-reform-plan-does-not-create-vouch", "ruling_link_text": "Claim draws too fine a distinction", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGingrey for Congress website, &quot;<a href=\"http://gingrey.com/index.php/congressman-gingrey-on-cnns-early-start-august-142012/\">Gingrey</a><a href=\"http://gingrey.com/index.php/congressman-gingrey-on-cnns-early-start-august-142012/\"> on CNN&rsquo;s Early Start</a>,&quot; Aug. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Jen Talaber, spokeswoman, U.S. Rep.
