Chris Christie is a ray of sunshine in a dark and dreary world.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA television ad broadcast in recent weeks by a group of Christie supporters paints that image of the governor, while touting his achievements of cutting spending and increasing education funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom a group called the Committee for Our Children&rsquo;s Future, the ad begins with a hazy image of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. as the narrator intones: &quot;Runaway spending, record debt, gridlock government. Washington is backwards.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen suddenly, the video turns to an image of a sunrise with the narrator telling us who&rsquo;s responsible: &quot;But Chris Christie, with bipartisan support, is taking New Jersey (in) another direction.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad goes on to claim Christie &quot;cut spending (by) $1 billion&quot; and provided &quot;$850 million in new education funding.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found that the group&rsquo;s numbers are technically correct, but the picture is less sunny when you examine the education funding changes over the course of Christie&rsquo;s tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with that $1 billion in spending cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $1 billion in spending cuts mentioned in the ad refers to the line-item vetoes made by Christie in response to a $30.6 billion budget approved in June by the Democratic-controlled Legislature.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith his line-item vetoes, Christie reduced the fiscal year 2012 budget to nearly $29.7 billion. So the group is right that he cut spending by about $1 billion from what the Legislature had approved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite that decrease, the fiscal year 2012 budget is still larger than the fiscal year 2011 budget that Christie signed in June 2010. The fiscal year 2012 budget is about $1.3 billion greater than the fiscal year 2011 budget approved last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, said that $1.3 billion -- most of which represents a pension payment and increased school aid -- was made possible by higher-than-anticipated revenue growth in fiscal year 2011 and projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s turn to the &quot;$850 million in new education funding&quot; mentioned in the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/11/jim-whelan/state-sen-jim-whelan-says-gov-chris-christie-slash/\">previous ruling</a>, we noted how the fiscal year 2012 budget increases education funding by about $863 million over the prior fiscal year. That figure supports the group&rsquo;s claim, but there&rsquo;s two problems with that argument.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, about half of that increased aid -- more than $446 million -- was required as part of a court order to go to the so-called Abbott districts. So Christie didn&rsquo;t have a choice about that money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecondly, the fiscal year 2011 budget cut education aid by about $829 million. That means the new budget only represents a net increase of about $30 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a Sept. 8 interview on an online radio show hosted by the New Jersey School Boards Association, Christie backs up that analysis:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yes, in my first year, we had to cut $820 million in funding from the public schools because we were in an enormous fiscal crisis. But the next year, this budget that I just signed...and advocated for, put an additional $850 million into the budget for public schools. So it paid back the entire cut from the year before of $820 million and added an additional $30 million on top of that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children&rsquo;s Future, defended both statements in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Christie did wind up cutting $1 billion in spending, as you note below, so I don&rsquo;t see how the statement can be seen as being false,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Again, Christie did wind up increasing education funding by $850 million this year. It&rsquo;s a true statement.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA television ad from a pro-Christie group claims the governor &quot;cut spending (by) $1 billion&quot; and provided &quot;$850 million in new education funding.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose numbers are accurate, but when it comes to the education funding, Committee for Our Children&rsquo;s Future must think New Jerseyans only have short-term memory. Given the cuts made last year, education funding has gone up by a total of about $30 million since Christie&rsquo;s first budget in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/politifact_nj_tv_ad_paints_too.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-05T16:36:42.049361", "ruling_date": "2011-10-06T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Television ad promotes Chris Christie\u2019s spending cuts, increased education funding", "ruling_headline_slug": "television-ad-promotes-chris-christies-spending-cu", "ruling_link_text": "What about last year\u2019s education cuts?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCommittee For Our Children&rsquo;s Future, <a href=\"http://forourkidsfuture.com/go.cfm?do=Press.View&amp;nid=18\">CCF Launches New Jersey TV Ad Campaign: Statewide Spot Promotes New Jersey&#39;s Reform Movement</a>, Sept. 20, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/as_gov_chris_christies_nationa.html\">As Gov.
