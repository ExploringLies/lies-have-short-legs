A <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4031\">related bill&nbsp;passed in the House</a>,&nbsp;but Rubio&#39;s bill&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t go anywhere in the Senate. So we wondered why Rubio said it &quot;passed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out, Rubio&rsquo;s legislation was included word-for-word in a larger bill known as the<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3230\"> Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014</a>, which was signed into law in August 2014. This law addressed the Veteran&rsquo;s Health Administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/05/21/a-guide-to-the-va-and-the-scandals-engulfing-it/\">scandal </a>in 2014, in which Veteran Affairs Secretary&nbsp;Eric Shinseki&nbsp;resigned following outcry that the VA had falsified data in regards to the long wait times veterans were met with when using VA hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This bill passed the&nbsp;Senate <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00187\">93-3</a>, with four members not voting. It passed in the House <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll516.xml\">265-160</a>, with six members not voting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One highlight from the law provides for more accountability for negligent senior managers of the law, which includes the ability to remove or demote senior executive officers for misconduct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio had a&nbsp;role in the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News reports provided by his spokeswoman backed this up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A McClatchy DC <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article24781498.html\">report</a>&nbsp;in March gave Rubio credit for playing a &quot;vital role&quot; in the final legislation, although the specific overhaul he sponsored did not pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/06/18/rubio-named-to-house-senate-committee-on-va-reform-bill/\">report</a> from CBS Miami mentions that Rubio was asked to be a part of the committee that oversees problems with veteran&rsquo;s health care: &quot;While he is not a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs, Rubio was asked to be part of the conference committee due to his work in sponsoring the VA Management Accountability Act of 2014.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, Capitol newspaper <em><a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/defense/214598-obama-signs-va-reform-bill-into-law\">The Hill</a></em> said Rubio&rsquo;s section about firing negligent VA workers was included in the overall bill-turned-law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marco Rubio&rsquo;s latest ad said he &quot;wrote and passed bipartisan legislation allowing the VA to fire negligent workers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is fairly accurate, with the one caveat being that his legislation was included in a larger bill, and passed as law with other reforms to the VA system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Editor&#39;s Note:&nbsp;</strong><em>This fact-check was updated Aug. 25, 2016, to clarify House action on a bill related to Rubio&#39;s.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-16T15:02:25.272319", "ruling_date": "2016-08-17T14:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rubio says he wrote, passed veteran affairs bill ", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-says-he-wrote-passed-veteran-affairs-bill", "ruling_link_text": "His bill was part pf a larger bill", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Olivia Perez-Cubas, Marco Rubio spokesperson, Aug. 12 &amp;
