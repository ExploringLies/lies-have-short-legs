She calls it a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot; for drug companies, saying the government can&rsquo;t use its bargaining power to try and obtain lower drug prices -- although others counter that competition among private insurers in Part D has led to lower prices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/\">True</a> a claim by Baldwin that the Part D law, &quot;adopted under Thompson&rsquo;s watch,&quot; bars the government from negotiating for &quot;better prices&quot; on prescription drugs. At the time, six weeks before the second debate with Baldwin, Thompson&rsquo;s campaign said nothing about the non-interference clause being the Democrats&rsquo; &nbsp;doing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a different claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Thompson&rsquo;s case</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html\">Medicare Part D</a> is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. A key feature is that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans and beneficiaries choose the plan that&#39;s best for them. The government subsidizes the program but does not run it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedical Part D was created by the <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/hr1\">Medicare Modernization Act</a>, which also made other changes to Medicare. It was proposed by President George W. Bush, and Thompson was the administration&rsquo;s point man on lobbying Congress to create it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked for evidence to back Thompson&rsquo;s claim that others were responsible for non-interference, his campaign did not respond. But Thompson expounded on his claim both in the second and third debates and in a <a href=\"http://bcove.me/miak23n9\">meeting</a> with <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> editors and reporters on the day of the second debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson said non-interference was first introduced by Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders in a Medicare Part D proposal in 1999, which did not become law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson also maintained that when the Bush administration proposed Part D, it contained only general principles. He said non-interference became part of the law only after it was introduced by then-Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I had nothing to do with it, never had a sweetheart deal with anybody,&quot; he told the <em>Journal Sentinel</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The record</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Clinton Part D <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-106s2342is/pdf/BILLS-106s2342is.pdf\">proposal</a> did, as Thompson said, include a non-interference clause. But the language differs from that in the Medicare Part D that later became <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-108hr1enr/pdf/BILLS-108hr1enr.pdf\">law</a> under Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the Clinton proposal, pharmacy benefit managers would have negotiated on behalf of the federal government with drug manufacturers, said <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/experts/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=32\">Edwin Park</a>, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut in Bush&rsquo;s Part D, the government can&rsquo;t negotiate at all, leaving negotiation up to the individual insurance plans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPark agreed with Thompson that Bush&rsquo;s Part D proposal was a set of principles and not legislation. But while Democrat Baucus was very involved in the Part D legislation, Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House, Park noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Thompson&rsquo;s claim that he had &quot;nothing to do&quot; with the non-interference clause that ended up in the law, that didn&rsquo;t wash with Park or other experts we interviewed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Any time Congress is involved in major legislation, the administration is heavily involved,&quot; said Park.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.galen.org/about/scholars-and-staff/\">Grace-Marie Turner</a>, president of the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free market principles in health care, said the Bush administration clearly supported non-interference to promote competition among private insurers and keep the government out of setting drug prices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s really the key element to allowing this competitive marketplace to work,&quot; said Turner, who noted that Medicare Part D has cost less than was anticipated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, in 2007, when Democrats pushed legislation to repeal non-interference, Bush <a href=\"http://www3.nationaljournal.com/pubs/healthline/m070112.htm#2\">threatened</a> a veto, arguing that competition among insurers was resulting in lower drug prices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson said Democrats first proposed prohibiting the government from negotiating prices for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and he &quot;had nothing to do with&quot; that provision in the final law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats did introduce a version of the so-called non-interference provision, but it didn&rsquo;t go as far as the provision that became law under Bush. Moreover, Thompson was the point man on Medicare Part D for the Bush administration, which supported non-interference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Thompson&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-29T18:20:58.104435", "ruling_date": "2012-10-30T13:35:23", "ruling_headline": "Tommy Thompson says he \"had nothing to do with\" provision barring U.S. from negotiating Medicare prescription drug prices ", "ruling_headline_slug": "tommy-thompson-says-he-had-nothing-do-provision-ba", "ruling_link_text": "GOP and he were in charge", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/\">&quot;Uncle Sam barred from bargaining Medicare drug prices, Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin says, blaming rival Tommy Thompson,&quot;</a> Sept. 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWTMJ-TV, Tammy Baldwin-Tommy Thompson debate<a href=\"http://www.620wtmj.com/multimedia/videos/?bctid=1910947360001\"> video</a>, Oct. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Public Television, Tammy Baldwin-Tommy Thompson debate <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/110543834/Wisconsin-Senate-Debate-Transcript-10-18-2012\">transcript</a>, Oct. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJSOnline.com, Tommy Thompson <a href=\"http://bcove.me/miak23n9\">interview</a>, Oct. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTommy Thompson campaign, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpf-L9i_qpw\">&quot;Architect&quot; TV ad</a>, Oct. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYouTube.com, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3neQqK0JgM\">video</a> of Tommy Thompson campaign appearance at Jewish Community Center (at 8:15), Oct. 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, American Enterprise Institute health care and retirement policy scholar Joseph Antos, Oct. 22 and 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Georgetown University health policy analyst and research and research professor Jack Hoadley, Oct. 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities vice president for health policy Edwin Park, Oct. 25 and 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Galen Institute president Grace-Marie Turner, Oct. 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInside CMS, &quot;Bush says he&#39;ll veto House RX price negotiation bill,&quot; Jan. 25, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment Printing Office, Clinton-administration backed Medicare Part D <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-106s2342is/pdf/BILLS-106s2342is.pdf\">bill</a>, Aug. 4, 2000<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment Printing Office, Medicare Part D <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-108hr1enr/pdf/BILLS-108hr1enr.pdf\">law</a>, Jan. 17, 2003<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Senate Finance Committee, Sen.
