In a statement to the Bay View Compass newspaper, he made a claim about Milwaukee County transit options that might make a voter in his district want to pony up more tax dollars for public transportation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHaas and his opponent, trucking company owner Steve Kraeger, submitted written responses to questions from the Compass, which appeared in the newspaper&#39;s Feb. 27, 2011 <a href=\"http://bayviewcompass.com/archives/6375\">issue</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn one of his responses, Haas discussed his views on the importance of public transit, including this observation:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Businesses have decided not to locate (in Milwaukee) precisely because there are no effective transit options; Milwaukee lost the headquarters of MillerCoors to Chicago, in large part, for that reason,&quot; Haas said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis caught our attention. It didn&rsquo;t sound right that a multi-billion dollar company moved its headquarters out of its home town because of the transit system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Haas for elaboration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said he based his comments on an article from the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2008/11/17/editorial1.html\">Business Journal</a>, a MillerCoors <a href=\"http://www.millercoors.com/news/press-releases/release/millercoors-selects-chicago-hq-location.aspx\">press </a><a href=\"http://www.millercoors.com/news/press-releases/release/millercoors-selects-chicago-hq-location.aspx\">release</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.tdawisconsin.org/docs/StateofTransportation1108.pdf\">study</a> from the nonprofit Transportation Development Association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at Haas&rsquo; evidence and found what amounted to the old game of telephone, where a statement is made, misunderstood, repeated, and so forth. The trail links Haas&rsquo; statement to a misleading item from the Business Journal, and back to a Chicago Tribune article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s start at the beginning -- the MillerCoors marriage and the merged company&rsquo;s decision on its corporate headquarters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time of the merger in 2008, Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co. and Denver-based Coors Brewing Co. were the number two and three brewers in the United States, respectively.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe merger was a joint-venture, a 50-50 ownership deal that meant neither company was acquiring the other. Speculation was rampant for months over where the headquarters of the new company would be located.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince both Miller and Coors had an equal amount of power in the new company, &nbsp;the headquarters decision was a touchy subject. Give the HQ to Denver or Milwaukee and it would be clear that one brewery was the &quot;winner.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA July 16, 2008 Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=121F8F5FF3C2E678&amp;p_docnum=21&amp;s_dlid=DL0111033019060428503&amp;s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&amp;s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&amp;s_trackval=&amp;s_siteloc=&amp;s_referrer=&amp;s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F31%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docsbal=%20&amp;s_subexpires=12%2F31%2F2015%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docstart=&amp;s_docsleft=&amp;s_docsread=&amp;s_username=mjssub&amp;s_accountid=AC0106100215163028011&amp;s_upgradeable=no\">article</a> quoted MillerCoors President Tom Long as saying it would have been &quot;too difficult&quot; to choose either Milwaukee or the Denver area as the MillerCoors headquarters location.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We came to the conclusion that we did need a neutral third place,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it wasn&rsquo;t about transportation at all, at least not in eliminating Milwaukee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how did transportation come into this equation?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to the decision.

This was accurate, since it referred to the Chicago vs. Dallas choice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a November 2008 <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2008/07/28/editorial2.html\">editorial</a>, however, The Business Journal said that the Chicago transit system was a &quot;key part of MillerCoors&rsquo; decision to locate the new joint venture&rsquo;s headquarters in that city, rather than Milwaukee.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCandidate Haas repeated -- and elaborated -- upon that statement. &nbsp;He said Milwaukee&rsquo;s lack of transit options was a &quot;large part&quot; of the reason MillerCoors went to Chicago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does that leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHaas said Milwaukee lost the MillerCoors headquarters because it lacks effective transit.
