Cox says New York state&rsquo;s debt per person is higher than any other state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have the highest debt per capita,&quot; Cox said at <a href=\"http://news.wbfo.org/post/republican-gubernatorial-hopefuls-debate-amherst\">a debate</a> among three Republican candidates for governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim comes among a string of criticisms from state Republicans against the economic record of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox recently claimed that unemployment was up in every county in the state outside New York City. We rated that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/jan/17/edward-cox/unemployment-inching-almost-every-county-outside-n/\">Mostly True</a>. State Sen. John DeFrancisco, a GOP candidate for governor, claimed that one-third of New York state&rsquo;s population is on Medicaid. That&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/jul/21/john-faso/one-three-people-new-york-are-medicaid/\">True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2016/jul/22/andrew-cuomo/new-york-has-more-private-sector-jobs-ever/\">also evidence</a> the state&rsquo;s economy has improved since Cuomo took office. The state has more private sector jobs than ever before, and unemployment has dropped statewide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what about the debt? It is one of the few economic indicators for the state we haven&rsquo;t looked at. Is Cox&rsquo;s claim correct?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government debt per capita</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesperson for Cox said he was talking about&nbsp;debt&nbsp;incurred by state and local governments, not personal debt like credit cards or auto loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state ranked highest in&nbsp;government debt for residents in 2015, the latest data available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The debt per person was $17,528 in New York state, <a href=\"https://www.empirecenter.org/publications/state-local-debt-per-capita/\">according to</a> the Empire Center. The center is a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility and effective and accountable government. It used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis to calculate the rate for each state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next highest state was Massachusetts, with government debt at $13,733 per person. Wyoming had the lowest rate, with $3,376 of government debt per person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York state has ranked highest each year since Cuomo took office in <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/facts-figures-2014-how-does-your-state-compare/\">2011</a>. Government debt was $17,204 per capita in New York state that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax policy and finance analysis organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cox said &quot;We have the highest debt per capita.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest data proves Cox&rsquo;s claim. New York state has had the highest state and local government debt per capita since at least 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-15T12:13:54.466177", "ruling_date": "2018-02-16T13:21:21", "ruling_headline": "New York state leads the country in government debt per resident", "ruling_headline_slug": "new-york-state-leads-country-government-debt-resid", "ruling_link_text": "Highest since 2011", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://news.wbfo.org/post/republican-gubernatorial-hopefuls-debate-amherst\">Republican gubernatorial hopefuls debate in Amherst</a>,&quot; WBFO, Feb. 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Jessica Proud, spokesperson for Edward Cox</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Ken Girardin, Policy Analyst at the Empire Center</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.empirecenter.org/publications/state-local-debt-per-capita/\">State and Local Debt Per Capita</a>, FY 2015, The Empire Center</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with John Buhl, Media Relations Manager at the Tax Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State and Local Debt Per Capita: <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/facts-figures-2014-how-does-your-state-compare/\">FY 2011</a>, <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/facts-figures-2015-how-does-your-state-compare/\">FY 2012</a>, <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/facts-figures-2016-how-does-your-state-compare/\">FY 2013</a>, <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/facts-figures-2017/\">FY 2014</a>, The Tax Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New York: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2018/jan/17/edward-cox/unemployment-inching-almost-every-county-outside-n/\">Unemployment inching up in almost every county outside New York City</a>, Jan. 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New York: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/jul/21/john-faso/one-three-people-new-york-are-medicaid/\">One in three people in New York is on Medicaid</a>, July 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New York: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2016/jul/22/andrew-cuomo/new-york-has-more-private-sector-jobs-ever/\">New York has more private sector jobs than ever before</a>, July 22, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "New York Republican Chairman", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Edward", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New York", "id": 3815, "last_name": "Cox", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "edward-cox", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Ed_Cox_Thumbnail.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3815/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://nygop.org"}, "statement": "<p>About New York state: &quot;We have the highest debt per capita.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "opening remarks at a Republican gubernatorial debate", "statement_date": "2018-02-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Andrew", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "New York", "id": 2880, "last_name": "Cuomo", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "andrew-cuomo", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Cuomo_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New York", "edition": "New York", "edition_slug": "new-york", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 55, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New York Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/55/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2880/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.governor.ny.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": "Which state has the highest government debt per resident?
