Sharpton was widely <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2011/08/18/fury-over-sharpton-speaking-at-crown-heights-riot-anniversary-forum/\">criticized for remarks</a> he made at a funeral that some said inflamed the situation that sparked the rioting. Sharpton also came under fire in 1995 for helping to sponsor protests during a landlord-tenant dispute that escalated and erupted into a fatal blaze at Jewish-owned <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/nyregion/death-125th-street-overview-gunman-7-others-die-blaze-harlem-store.html?pagewanted=all\">Freddy&rsquo;s Fashion Mart</a> in Harlem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin emailed a request for comment from Sharpton to his Harlem-based National Action Network but received no response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Washington Post fact checker</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has not looked at this claim before, but our friends at the Washington Post have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2014, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during an interview on CBS News&#39; &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/rudy-giuliani-obama-signaling-hes-against-the-police/\">Face the Nation</a>,&quot; said President Barack Obama &quot;has had Al Sharpton to the White House 80, 85 times&quot; and that made Sharpton a &quot;close adviser.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Post checked White House visitor logs and reported that Sharpton&#39;s recorded visits through December 2014 stood at 72:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>One-on-one meetings: 5 (7 percent)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Meetings with staff members or senior advisers, with more than one guest: 20 (27 percent)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Events with more than 90 people: 16 (22 percent)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Miscellaneous meetings or events, ranging from 3 to 700 guests: 31 (43 percent)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Post concluded that Giuliani picked the high end of the range from 80 to 85 visits that Sharpton made to the White House through 2014 and said &quot;it is correct that the figure Giuliani cites fits within the reported range.&quot; But Giuliani earned one Pinocchio for the &quot;exaggeration&quot; of referring to Sharpton as an Obama White House &quot;close adviser.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Post Fact Checker defines <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/?utm_term=.7b63848232d2\">one Pinocchio </a>as &quot;some shading of the facts. Selective telling of the truth. Some omissions and exaggerations, but no outright falsehoods.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin visited the <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/goodgovernment/tools/visitor-records\">White House Visitor Log</a> site to check the data for Sharpton&#39;s visits after December 2014, but the site features this note: &nbsp;&quot;This is historical material &#39;frozen in time.&#39; The website is no longer updated and links to external websites and some internal pages may not work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas Hayes, archivist at the Barack Obama Presidential Library, noted in an email that the records we needed are not currently available to the public through records requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Barack Obama Presidential <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/laws/1978-act.html\">records</a> are administered in accordance with the requirements of the 1978<a href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/WRTeCxkzRvC2zL2EHwKb-I?domain=archives.gov\"> Presidential Records Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2201-2209</a>. &nbsp;Under this law, Presidential records are not available to the public through<a href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/X66QCyPAVrilp7lOFNLjNQ?domain=archives.gov\"> Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/\">requests</a> until five years after the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) takes custody of the records or until NARA staff has completed processing and organization of an integral file segment of these Presidential records, whichever is earlier. &nbsp;Neither of these terms have been met, therefore the Barack Obama Presidential records that you seek are not available at this time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/328857-trump-administration-wont-release-white-house-visitor-logs\">Memory Hole 2</a> website: &quot;the Obama White House kept adding its visitor logs to the same spreadsheet file, instead of releasing separate files covering certain time periods. That spreadsheet eventually grew gargantuan. When last updated at the end of 2016, it had become 1.1 gigabytes with 6 million rows. This is a big problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site pointed out that &quot;the most popular spreadsheet software -- Excel, a part of Microsoft Office -- maxes out at just over a million rows. Word won&#39;t even try to open a file over 500 megs. And even if you had willing software, it&#39;s unlikely that a typical computer can handle the job. What good is an important historical record that almost no one can open?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the frozen White House site did have visitor logs posted through September 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin was able to <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/goodgovernment/tools/visitor-records\">download the massive visitor log</a> and, with an assist from data wiz Michael Andre come up with this tally of listed names: Alfred C.
