He did so in a June 5, 2017 <a href=\"http://wtaq.com/podcasts/the-jerry-bader-show/921/governor-walker-on-5-year-anniversary-of-recall-election/\">interview with Jerry Bader</a>, a conservative radio talk show host in Green Bay, saying: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that Walker never proposed to increase the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected -- and that he tried, with vetoes, to stave off levy increases approved by the County Board of Supervisors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But saying he &quot;pushed through budgets&quot; suggests he was successful, when in fact he largely was not:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In eight of Walker&rsquo;s nine years as county executive, the levy increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker&rsquo;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker proposed nine county budgets, for 2003 through 2011, before taking office as governor in January 2011. Working with a left-leaning County Board, typically there was a tug-of-war in which Walker tended toward lower property taxes and less spending, while the board would aim for more. Often there were Walker vetoes and veto overrides by the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Walker&rsquo;s claim, his staff pointed us to figures from the Milwaukee County <a href=\"http://county.milwaukee.gov/PSB/County-Budget/Previous-County-Budgets.htm\">budget archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his first two budgets, for 2003 and 2004, Walker proposed a property tax levy lower than what the County Board had adopted the previous year. But for both budgets, the County Board adopted levies higher than what Walker proposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the levy rose in 2003 and dropped in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then a routine developed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. </strong>Walker would propose for his new budget a levy that was the same amount as the previous year&rsquo;s levy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The County Board would override Walker vetoes and adopt a budget that included a levy higher than what Walker proposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Walker would use that increased levy as his proposed levy for the next year&rsquo;s budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example: Walker&rsquo;s proposed levy of $225.9 million for 2006 was exactly the same as the levy that the County Board had adopted for 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the levy that the board approved for 2006 was higher -- $232.6 million. And that was the levy Walker then made in his budget proposal for 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the figures for the county budgets during Walker&rsquo;s tenure:</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\"
