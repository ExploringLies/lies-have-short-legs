Ron Johnson is once again in the crosshairs of a national conservation group for his voting record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/\">League of Conservation Voters</a> has run a series of television ads against Johnson, a first-term senator who is facing a 2016 rematch with Democrat Russ Feingold. The ads have aired in anticipation of possible action by Republicans in Congress to undo Obama Administration regulations limiting carbon emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $1.6 million campaign includes an ad called <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/assets/docs/wi-disappear-ad-backup.pdf\">&quot;Disappear,&quot;</a> and another dubbed <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/media/great-lakes-ad-backup-1.pdf\">&quot;Lakes.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both make variations of the same claim: That &quot;Ron Johnson led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution.&quot; The second ad includes this addendum: &quot;... and took nearly $225,000 from polluters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out the environmental groups are doing a bit of recycling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support for the legislation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/29/league-conservation-voters/sen-ron-johnson-voted-unlimited-carbon-pollution-e/\">checked a similar claim in 2013</a> when the League of Conservation Voters <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFbnJcHDS4w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">aired an ad </a>that said Johnson had taken &quot;more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/29/league-conservation-voters/sen-ron-johnson-voted-unlimited-carbon-pollution-e/\">True.</a> Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions. And, at the time that ad aired, he had received<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=2014&amp;cid=N00032546&amp;type=I&amp;newmem=N\"> $109,550</a> from oil and gas interests since his first campaign in 2010, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same votes are cited in the most recent ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the wording varies a bit. It says Johnson &quot;led the fight,&quot; which is problematic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/media/great-lakes-ad-backup-1.pdf\">backup for the ad </a>cites two measures that Johnson voted in favor of -- one in <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00054\">2011 </a>and one in <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00076\">2013</a> -- that would have blocked the EPA from strengthening the carbon emission standards. However, he was not a sponsor or co-sponsor of either amendment, so it&rsquo;s hard to consider him a leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group also noted Johnson &quot;has co-sponsored legislation, written to President Obama, and spoken to the media regarding his opposition to the Clean Power Plan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1324/cosponsors\">bill the group cites, the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act</a>, was introduced May 13, 2015. Johnson is among 35 co-sponsors. That&rsquo;s nearly two-thirds of the 54 senators who are Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=0e80b276-1dc3-4500-a3a6-754d7b0b27bd\">letter cited </a>was written to Obama June 4, 2014. It called on him to withdraw the EPA carbon rules. Johnson was one of 41 Republican senators who signed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the group cites a quote from Johnson <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/gop-senators-want-to-block-obamas-climate-rules\">in a June 18, 2014 article </a>posted by the liberal blog Talking Points Memo. In it, Johnson said he&#39;d be &quot;totally supportive&quot; of using government funding legislation to block the EPA rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m a manufacturer. You actually need power if you&#39;re going to manufacture things,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#39;s not drive, artificially, the cost of power up -- that&#39;s a self-inflicted wound. That&#39;s what this administration is doing and I have no idea why they&#39;d want to do that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was one of a half dozen GOP senators quoted in the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, while Johnson took the steps, the group provides little evidence he was out in front or somehow spearheading them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Campaign contributions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the ad offers a new figure for campaign cash (nearly $225,000) and instead of &quot;oil and gas,&quot; describes the contributors as &quot;polluters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to same campaign contribution database we previously reviewed, Johnson received &nbsp;$133,600 from the oil and gas industry, $63,428 from the mining, and $22,700 from electric power utilities. That tallies out to $219,728.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger called the ads a &quot;false partisan attack&quot; and said they distorted Johnson&rsquo;s position &quot;that we can protect our economy and environment at the same time with a balanced national energy policy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The League of Conservation voters launched TV ads that claim Johnson &quot;led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly $225,000 from polluters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the ad&rsquo;s content is recycled. The claim, however, is puffed up a bit this time because it says Johnson &quot;led&quot; the effort. We did not find much evidence of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That knocks the claim down to Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-07T17:11:49.709062", "ruling_date": "2015-10-09T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Environmental group claims Ron Johnson voted against carbon limits, took cash from polluters", "ruling_headline_slug": "environmental-group-claims-ron-johnson-voted-again", "ruling_link_text": "Recycled claim, with an overheated twist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/media/great-lakes-ad-backup-1.pdf\">League of Conservation Voters ad, &quot;Lakes,&quot; Sept. 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>League of Conservation Voters ad, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFbnJcHDS4w&amp;feature=youtu.be\">&quot;Senator Ron Johnson &lsquo;Action&rsquo; ad,&quot; </a>Aug. 14, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>League of Conservation Voters <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/media/great-lakes-ad-backup-1.pdf\">ad backup </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>League of Conservation Voters <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/media/press-releases/New-Major-Ad-Campaign-Holds-Ron-Johnson-Accountable-for-Putting-Polluters-Profits-Ahead-of-Wisconsin-s-Health.html\">press release, July 27, 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=2014&amp;cid=N00032546&amp;type=I&amp;newmem=N\">Open Secrets.org campaign contribution database</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/media/great-lakes-ad-backup-1.pdf\">&quot;Sen.
