Both chambers are expected to keep the total pricetag under $1 trillion.</p>\r\n<p>We'll save you from counting zeros on your online calculator and give you our quick and dirty assessment of whether his analogy is right.  <br /> <br /> First, a starting point. Biblical scholars may quibble about the actual birth date of Jesus Christ, but we're going to go with the fairly  <a href=\"http://www.themoorings.org/apologetics/chronology/Chrmas.html\" target=\"_blank\"> commonly accepted theory </a> that it was around 4 B.C. That's right, it would mean Christ was actually born \"Before Christ.\"  <br /> <br /> Add that to Anno Domini time, and you come to 2012 years since the birth of Christ.  <br /> <br /> So here goes our math: 2,012 times 365 (yes, we are aware there are leap years ... don't be like that) times $1,000,000. A: $734 billion (give or take a few hundred million).  <br /> <br /> The stimulus package is actually short of $1 trillion too, $819 billion. But that's still more than a million bucks a day since the day Jesus was born. We find McConnell's staggering stat to be True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:51.701649", "ruling_date": "2009-02-03T16:17:25", "ruling_headline": "Stimulus plan comes to more than a million bucks a day since Jesus Christ was born", "ruling_headline_slug": "stimulus-plan-more-million-day-jesus-christ-was-bo", "ruling_link_text": "That's a lot of loaves and fishes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CQ Politics,  <a href=\"http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003022312\" target=\"_blank\"> \"Noted and Quoted,\" </a> Feb. 1, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Bible Studies at the Moorings,  <a href=\"http://www.themoorings.org/apologetics/chronology/Chrmas.html\" target=\"_blank\"> The date of Christ's birth </a></p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "Senate minority leader", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Mitch", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Kentucky", "id": 106, "last_name": "McConnell", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "mitch-mcconnell", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mcconnell.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/106/", "total_count": 33, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://mcconnell.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p><br /> To give the proposed economic stimulus plan some perspective, \"if you started the day Jesus Christ was born and spent $1 million every day since then, you still wouldn&rsquo;t have spent $1 trillion.\"</p>", "statement_context": "appearance on CBS's \"Face the Nation\"", "statement_date": "2009-02-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 150, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/150/", "subject": "Stimulus", "subject_slug": "stimulus", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
