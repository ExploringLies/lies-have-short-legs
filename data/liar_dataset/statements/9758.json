But to categorize the Islamic State as &quot;too extreme&quot; isn&rsquo;t quite accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of fundamentalism, the Islamic State&rsquo;s enforcement of Sharia law is certainly &quot;the most traditional of the traditional&quot; if not down-right draconian, said Colin Clarke, a terrorism expert at the think tank RAND. But, according to Long, al-Qaida just hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunity to the do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for brutality of actions, the extremism just manifests differently. Long and Clarke both pointed that al-Qaida certainly has not hesitated to kill civilians or fellow Muslims in certain contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The true difference between the two groups is ideological -- why and how to carry out a holy war, according to Long and William Braniff, executive director at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none; width:585px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>The Islamic State</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Al-Qaida</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Goal</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Establish a caliphate</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Establish a caliphate through incremental steps (first, drive the West out of the Middle East)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><em>Purpose of violence</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>To purify Islam, ignite a civil war</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>To awaken the masses</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p style=\"margin-left:0pt\"><em>Method</em></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mobilizing against &quot;the near enemy&quot;</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mobilizing against the West</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: Interviews with Long and Braniff </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al-Qaida certainly has objected to the Islamic State&rsquo;s sometimes anti-Muslim tactics since at least 2006, but the concerns were less about ethics and more about strategy. Al-Qaida&rsquo;s current leader Ayman al-Zawahiri reprimanded the Islamic State, then al-Qaida in Iraq, in a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/10/11/alqaeda.letter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>letter</u></a> that warns AQI against focusing on the wrong enemy and losing Muslim support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Muslim populace who love and support you will never find palatable ... the scenes of slaughtering the hostages,&quot; Zawahiri wrote. &quot;Is the opening of another front now in addition to the front against the Americans and the government a wise decision? Or does this conflict with Shia lift the burden from the Americans by diverting the mujahedeen to the Shia, while the Americans continue to control matters from afar?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why was it disowned?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that the Islamic State was cast off by al-Qaida <em>because </em>of its brutality is &quot;a bit of a misnomer,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;Really the splintering emerged from a command and control problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though al-Qaida&rsquo;s central command has limited control over its affiliates, the Islamic State has actively disobeyed orders from headquarters. And its activities threaten the legitimacy of al-Qaida&rsquo;s presence in the Middle East, while its conflicts with other terrorist affiliates were seen as destabilizing, Braniff said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest fallout was in 2013, when Baghdadi declared the establishment of ISIS, incorporating Syrian jihadist group Nusra Front without the consent of Nusra, experts agreed. Tensions metastasized when Nusra <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/17/us-syria-crisis-nusra-idUSBRE94G0FY20130517\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>objected</u></a> to this merge, and al-Qaida central had to step in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Al-Qaida&rsquo;s Zawahiri <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/06/2013699425657882.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>scolded</u></a> Baghdadi for declaring ISIS without asking or even talking to al-Qaida, and ruled that the two groups would be separate and confined to their respective countries-- Nusra in Syria, ISI in Iraq. Baghdadi said, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/06/2013615172217827810.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>no, ISIS would stay as ISIS</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This feud with Nusra sowed the seeds for al-Qaida&rsquo;s rejection of ISIS and siding with Nusra. By 2014, ISIS was continuing its violent tactics. What&rsquo;s more, it was <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/state-expels-rivals-from-syria-city-2014714134248239815.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fighting</u></a> with Nusra and other rebel groups actively. Al-Qaida had had enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s true that ISIS is more brutal than al-Qaida would like, and al-Qaida had told them repeatedly to cool it with the killing of the shiites. But the problem really was that al-Qaida had been saying, &lsquo;Hey stop this,&rsquo; and (ISIS) was not listening,&quot; Clarke said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gregory said, the Islamic State was &quot;cast off by al-Qaida because this group is considered too extreme.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Islamic State certainly was cast-off by al-Qaida, but to say it was because the Islamic State is &quot;considered too extreme&quot; is a bit of an oversimplification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is true that al-Qaida considered some of the Islamic State&rsquo;s actions unnecessarily brutal, there were a couple of other reasons for the fallout. The Islamic State&rsquo;s ideological differences with the al-Qaida brand and its constant failure to obey orders from headquarters had been sawing away its ties to al-Qaida for quite some time. In-fighting with Nusra in Syria and continued killing of fellow Muslims were the final straws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, shorthanding the Islamic State as too extreme leaves out the nuances behind the split. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Gregory&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-13T10:28:06.941303", "ruling_date": "2014-08-13T12:07:30", "ruling_headline": "David
