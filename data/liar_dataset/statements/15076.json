Tompkins, a Democrat, <a href=\"http://ago.wv.gov/publicresources/Documents/Opinions%201986-1994/1990-03-08%20Opinion%20letter%20signed%20by%20Roger%20Tompkins%20(M0040939xCECC6).PDF\">wrote an opinion</a> saying, &quot;There is no right to strike against the state. Thus, any strike or concerted work stoppage by the public teachers of this state is illegal. &hellip; It is our opinion that any strike by public teachers is illegal and may be dealt with accordingly by school officials.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Supreme Court essentially agreed with this reasoning in a <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/west-virginia/supreme-court/1990/19575-5.html\">ruling</a> on April 12, 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Public employees have no right to strike in the absence of express legislation or, at the very least, appropriate statutory provisions for collective bargaining, mediation, and arbitration,&quot; the court wrote. &quot;In view of our legislature&#39;s silence on these complex issues, we decline to intervene.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The West Virginia Education Association, the state affiliate of the National Education Association, the national teacher&#39;s union,&nbsp;did not respond to an inquiry for this article. When the group&rsquo;s president, Dale Lee, was previously asked whether a strike was illegal, Lee acknowledged &quot;Probably yes,&quot; according to the <em>Gazette-Mail</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morrisey&rsquo;s tweet was carefully worded, legal experts say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he had used the word &quot;illegal,&quot; he might have been open to critique on the grounds that teachers would not be committing a crime by taking part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I know of nothing that says a teacher who strikes commits a crime,&quot; said West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress. &quot;Participating in a strike would be no different from a teacher who feigns illness to get a day off. The conduct could expose the teacher to discipline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howard Seufer Jr., an attorney in Charleston, agreed. &quot;Strikes by public employees are not crimes in our state,&quot; he said. &quot;But public employees do not enjoy a right under our laws to strike.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On another linguistic note, Seufer pointed out that the 1990 state Supreme Court ruling specifically noted that it was using the terms &quot;strike&quot; and &quot;work stoppage&quot; interchangably. That aligns with a 1965 opinion by the same court, which &quot;suggested that a &lsquo;strike&rsquo; refers to the actions of employees that may result in such a work stoppage,&quot; Seufer said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it sounds unusual for a union to be unable to strike, that&rsquo;s the case in West Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unions in West Virginia, including the WVEA, &quot;exist as voluntary associations that lobby on behalf of their members and provide them with certain services, such as representation in grievance and disciplinary proceedings,&quot; Seufer said. &quot;But our laws do not treat these associations as unions in the same sense other states do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, West Virginia law does not recognize a right for public school employees to collectively bargain, he said. Rather, the legislature regulates public school labor by statute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bastress said that common law applies on the issue of strikes, &quot;and there is no right to strike in common law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Referring to a West Virginia teacher&rsquo;s strike, Morrisey tweeted that &quot;the impending work stoppage is unlawful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Precedents both from his own office and from the state Supreme Court support that view, and Morrisey was careful to say &quot;unlawful&quot; rather than &quot;illegal.&quot; By going on strike, the teachers are not taking part in criminal activity; they are at risk of disciplinary action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-02-26T11:50:18.991052", "ruling_date": "2018-02-26T16:43:31", "ruling_headline": "Precedent says West Virginia teacher's strike isn't lawful", "ruling_headline_slug": "precedent-says-west-virginia-teachers-strike-isnt-", "ruling_link_text": "Solid precedent from 1990", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Patrick Morrisey, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorriseyWV/status/966430752685600768\">tweet</a>, Feb. 21, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, <em><a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/west-virginia/supreme-court/1990/19575-5.html\">Jefferson Cty.
