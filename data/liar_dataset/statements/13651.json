Jerry Brown vowed to defend the protections California&nbsp;affords all immigrants in the state, documented or not, against the Trump administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We will defend everybody &ndash; every man, woman and child &ndash; who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state,&quot; Brown said in his speech delivered at the state Capitol in Sacramento on January 24, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown added that immigrants are an integral part of California, helping &quot;create the wealth and dynamism of this state from the very beginning.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He went on to say &quot;27 percent&quot; of Californians or &quot;almost 11 million were born in a foreign land.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact-check Brown on those numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Brown pointed to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau to back up the statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2015 American Community Survey does, in fact, list California&rsquo;s &quot;foreign born&quot; population <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/06\">at 27 percent</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bureau defines foreign-born as anyone who is not a U.S. citizen at birth, including those who become U.S. citizens through naturalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s overall population was approximately 39.2 million as of July 1, 2016, according to census figures. Twenty-seven percent of that total would be about 10.6 million people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown is on track when he described the figure as &quot;almost 11 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/bio.asp?i=132\">Hans Johnson</a>, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, told us the 2015 American Community Survey is the best source on the state&#39;s foreign born population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=258\">2013 study</a> using older data, the policy institute itself reported that 27 percent of California&rsquo;s population was foreign born, about twice the U.S. percentage. California&rsquo;s percentage appears to have remained steady in more recent years, according to the 2015 census study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>California&#39;s foreign-born</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forty seven percent of California&rsquo;s immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, while about 26 percent had some other legal status, according the policy institute&rsquo;s report. The study estimates 27 percent were undocumented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, where do California&rsquo;s foreign born come from? More than half, or 53 percent, were born in Latin America, while 37 percent was born in Asia, according to <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/publication_show.asp?i=258\">the PPIC study</a>. Mexico at 4.3 million, the Philippines at 812,000 and China at 760,000 are the leading countries of origin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nation&rsquo;s foreign-born population reached 42.2 million, or 13.2 percent, in 2014, according to the <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/04/19/statistical-portrait-of-the-foreign-born-population-in-the-united-states-key-charts/\">Pew Research Center</a>. That total has more than quadrupled since 1965, though its pace of growth has begun to slow in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov. Jerry Brown claimed in his <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/articles/2017/01/24/transcript-and-analysis-gov-jerry-browns-state-of-the-state-address\">State of the State Address</a> that 27 percent of Californians, almost 11 million, &quot;were born in a foreign land.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2015 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau verifies that statistic. Additionally, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, which studies the state&rsquo;s immigration and demographic patterns, confirmed the census report is the best authority on California&rsquo;s foreign born population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Brown&#39;s claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/157c1e3a-89e6-45e3-874b-afd232d8790c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/157c1e3a-89e6-45e3-874b-afd232d8790c</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-01-24T18:37:19.023768", "ruling_date": "2017-01-24T15:46:17", "ruling_headline": "TRUE: 27 percent of Californians 'were born in a foreign land'", "ruling_headline_slug": "true-27-percent-californians-were-born-foreign-lan", "ruling_link_text": "Census figures back Brown's claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gov.
