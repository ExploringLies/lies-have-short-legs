Iran has been on the U.S. State Department&rsquo;s list of <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm\">state sponsors of terrorism</a> since 1984. Those countries (Iran, Sudan, Syria and <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-11-20/trump-declares-north-korea-a-state-sponsor-of-terrorism\">North Korea</a>) have been determined to have &quot;repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s get to the thrust of Nicholson&rsquo;s claim -- that the deal merely &quot;handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes&quot; to Iran and that Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The cash</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/29/reince-priebus/iran-nuclear-deal-was-hillary-clintons-and-it-line/\">The deal</a>, struck in July 2015 under President <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/\">Barack Obama</a>, was with Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. The deal restricted certain Iranian nuclear activities for periods between 10 to 25 years, and allowed for more intrusive, permanent monitoring. It also prohibited Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it wasn&rsquo;t just merely turning over cash to Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Latest Kevin Nicholson fact checks:</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p>&quot;Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/09/kevin-nicholson/sen-tammy-baldwin-did-back-department-peace-kevin-/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><br />\r\n\t\t\tSays conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein is a Wisconsin resident. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/04/kevin-nicholson/what-makes-illinois-resident-wisconsin-resident/\">False</a>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p><br />\r\n\t\t\t&quot;There are more guns in this country than there are people.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/20/kevin-nicholson/which-higher-number-people-or-number-guns-america/\">Half True</a>.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the deal, Iran did get access to tens of billions of dollars in assets &nbsp;&mdash; but the vast majority of those assets are Iran&rsquo;s own money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what cash was delivered on a plane was far less than billions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our PolitiFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-calls-400-million-payment-iran-ransom/\">colleagues</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/may/08/trump-withdrew-us-iran-nuclear-deal-heres-what-you/\">have</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2017/jun/06/karen-handel/Handel-pushes-details-Iran-deal-terror-support/\">reported</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The deal released Iranian assets frozen under a variety of sanctions. The assets, cash in the bank, real estate or something else, belonged to Iran in the first place.

As part of a 2015 deal aimed making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, Iran got access to tens of billions of dollars of its own assets that had been frozen &nbsp;&mdash; there weren&rsquo;t billions of dollars sent on a plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States, in a transaction indirectly linked to the Iran deal, did send on a plane $400 million in cash to Iran. Iran was owed the money because it had paid the United States for military hardware in 1979 that was never delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Baldwin was not among the first senators to support the Iran nuclear deal.
