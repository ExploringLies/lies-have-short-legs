Rick Perry&#39;s legacy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHint: White doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s shaping up so well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Rick Perry and his consultants and his insiders will take credit for all the good times in Texas,&quot; White said. &quot;But they won&#39;t take responsibility for the fact that today, there&#39;s almost 1 million Texans who are unemployed and that&#39;s an all-time record number in our state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe gauntlet is thrown. Do the jobless numbers back White up?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Texas Workforce Commission, more than one million people were unemployed in January, but that includes seasonal employees who were laid off after the holidays. The seasonally-adjusted data shows that 996,863 were unemployed &mdash; about 3,000 shy of 1 million. That number has been increasing steadily since early 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe latest count also is a Texas record, topping the 765,894 residents who were out of work in October 1986.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a head count isn&#39;t the only way to judge joblessness over time. We looked at the rate of unemployment, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state rate &mdash; 8.2 percent as of January &mdash; has also crept up since 2008, due at least in part to a nationwide recession. But it hasn&#39;t yet matched the worst times of the 1980s recession in Texas, which was driven by an oil bust.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe monthly unemployment rate peaked twice that decade, reaching 8.4 percent in January 1983 and 9.3 percent in September 1986.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe annual unemployment stats are similar. The 2009 unemployment rate was 7.6 percent &mdash; the same as the rate in 1992. But the state&#39;s annual unemployment rate has been higher; it was 8.5 percent in 1987 and 8.9 percent in 1986.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the unemployment rate isn&#39;t yet at its highest in Texas &mdash; not that having the third highest rate is anything to celebrate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnyway, White didn&#39;t cast the rate as highest-ever. Nor did Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, when he blasted Perry on primary election night for an &quot;unemployment rate (that&#39;s) higher than it&#39;s been in decades.&quot; Two decades, to be precise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite is correct that the number of unemployed Texans &mdash; almost 1 million &mdash; is an all-time high. We rate his statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-05T14:27:00.771528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-06T23:11:09", "ruling_headline": "White says almost 1 million people are unemployed in Texas \u2014 a state record ", "ruling_headline_slug": "white-says-almost-1-million-people-are-unemployed-", "ruling_link_text": "But it's not the state's highest unemployment rate ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTexas Workforce Commission, Unemployment 1976-2010, accessed March 4, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMemo from Nathan Dacschle, executive director, Democratic Governors Association, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/030210_daschleunemployment.doc\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Why Democrats can win Texas,&quot; </a>March 2, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBill White for Texas, <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/audio/2010/mar/02/audio-bill-white-victory-speech/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill White&#39;s victory speech,</a> March 2, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Former mayor of Houston", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 294, "last_name": "White", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "bill-white", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Whitemug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/294/", "total_count": 26, "true_count": 6, "website": "https://www.facebook.com/BillWhiteTexas"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;There&#39;s almost 1 million Texans who are unemployed and that&#39;s an all-time record number in our state.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2010-03-02", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 30, "current_job": "U.S. Energy Secretary", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 42, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 291, "last_name": "Perry", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "rick-perry", "pants_count": 18, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Perry_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/291/", "total_count": 176, "true_count": 26, "website": "https://energy.gov/management/history/secretaries-energy"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
