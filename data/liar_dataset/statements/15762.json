But did it really happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/\">pitch-black</a> void of evidence to suggest that Diesel died. This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Reputable news stories usually come with a byline to keep writers accountable and allow readers to contact the author if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below the headline, there are two paragraphs lifted, word-for-word, from Vin Diesel&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Diesel\">Wikipedia page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The page also contains a video clip featuring a Fox News logo and a newscaster. Clicking on it, you&rsquo;d expect to hear a news anchor reporting on the news of Vin Diesel&rsquo;s death. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you click on the video, you&rsquo;ll actually hear the anchor say, &quot;Finally, I have some very sad news,&quot; before the clip freezes and is replaced by the words &quot;Share to Uncover This Video.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clicking on those words opens up a pop-up window that allows you to share a link to the article on Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found after we shared the story, the video still would not load.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Nexis search revealed that no major news outlets have reported on Diesel&rsquo;s death, and no obituaries have been written for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time that <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/vin-diesel-death-hoax/\">incorrect rumors</a> of Diesel&rsquo;s death have spread <a href=\"https://www.riddickmovie.com/\">like the Necromongers across the galaxy</a>.
