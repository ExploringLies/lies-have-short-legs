How did this happen? Years of liberal failure doing too much for too many. Take illegal immigration: Politicians have lacked the guts to tackle the problem. As governor, I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7qs5VbvHBk?start=14\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ad, Poizner doesn&rsquo;t specifically bring up health benefits, but instead makes the blanket pledge to stop all benefits for undocumented Californians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Changed positions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, Poizner told newspaper editorial boards he&rsquo;s changed some of his positions on immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I regret the tone and direction that we took in that campaign,&quot; he said in an <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/05/steve-poizner-california-insurance-commissioner-republican-independent/\">interview</a> with the Bay Area News Group editorial board this week, calling his approach in that race &quot;wrong and harmful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poizner told the editorial board that he now believes everyone who&rsquo;s undocumented should be &quot;put on a path to get documented,&quot; and young people in the DACA program should be eligible for U.S. citizenship, <em>The Mercury News</em> reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Ricardo-Lara-glad-that-Steve-Poizner-12870002.php\">told</a> the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> editorial board he no longer wants to cut tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poizner said he took his previous anti-immigrant positions while under &quot;huge pressure&quot; in a competitive primary race against former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, according to the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poizner&rsquo;s campaign did not respond to three requests from PolitiFact California on where he stands on the specific issue of providing health benefits to undocumented children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time in the Legislature, Lara has worked to expand health coverage to all undocumented Californians. In 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Lara&#39;s <a href=\"https://sd33.senate.ca.gov/news/2015-10-09-governor-signs-lara%E2%80%99s-health-all-kids-act\">Health For All Kids Act 2015</a>, which gave Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented kids and teens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara claimed in full-page newspaper ads that his opponent in California&rsquo;s Insurance Commissioner race, Steve Poizner, &quot;pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance,&quot; when Poizner previously held the state post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poizner did make a general promise to block benefits for undocumented Californians, though that was eight years ago, in a Republican primary race for governor. He said in an ad: &quot;I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants,&quot; though he didn&rsquo;t specify the kind of benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably, Lara&rsquo;s statement ignores Poizner&rsquo;s shift on immigration. Poizner told newspapers this spring he now favors some benefits for undocumented Californians and a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, and that his past approach was &quot;harmful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poizner&rsquo;s campaign did not respond to requests about his stance on health benefits for undocumented children, leaving his position on that unclear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, we found there&rsquo;s some truth to Lara&rsquo;s statement, but it leaves out important details and takes things out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it &nbsp;Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>HALF TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click here for<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-30T14:47:33.730591", "ruling_date": "2018-10-30T13:08:24", "ruling_headline": "Fact-checking immigration claim in California Insurance Commissioner race", "ruling_headline_slug": "fact-checking-immigration-claim-california-insuran", "ruling_link_text": "Claim leaves out key information", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Richie Ross, campaign consultant, Ricardo Lara for Insurance Commissioner, email exchange, Oct. 18, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youtube.com, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7qs5VbvHBk\">Poizner: In His Words</a>, Oct. 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>San Diego Union-Tribune</em>, <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-immigration-grabs-stage-in-gop-race-for-governor-2010may11-htmlstory.html\">Immigration grabs stage in GOP race for governor</a>, May 11, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>StevePoizner.com, <a href=\"http://www.stevepoizner.com/about\">About Steve</a>, Accessed Oct. 26. 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Los Angeles&nbsp;Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-steve-poizner-insurance-commissioner-independent-candidate-20180212-story.html\">He once held the job as a Republican, but now Steve Poizner is making a no-party bid for California insurance commissioner</a>, Feb. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SFGate.com,<a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Ricardo-Lara-glad-that-Steve-Poizner-12870002.php\"> Ricardo Lara glad that Steve Poizner &quot;repents&quot; for past immigration positions</a>, April 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mercury News,</em> <a href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/05/steve-poizner-california-insurance-commissioner-republican-independent/\">Steve Poizner, now running as an independent, says he regrets past immigration stances</a>, April 5, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Ricardo", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 4474, "last_name": "Lara", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "ricardo-lara", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/lara_mug_3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4474/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>As California&#39;s&nbsp;Insurance Commissioner, &quot;Steve Poizner pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "full-page newspaper ads", "statement_date": "2018-10-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
