Thank you, Kanye, thank you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to take a closer look at the numbers. It turns out Trump garbled the results of a real survey that showed a much more nuanced picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Sample too small</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump appears to have been referencing a Reuters weekly <a href=\"https://polling.reuters.com/#poll/CP3_2/filters/SC_RACE:2,SEX:1/dates/20180101-20180501/type/week\">poll</a> that showed his approval rating among black men going from 11 percent for the week ending April 22 to 22 percent for the week ending April 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So even if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump&rsquo;s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans in general. (The poll showed that his approval rating among black Americans overall went from 8.9 percent to 16.5 percent over the same period.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s reason to be wary of concluding, based on this poll, that Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the sample size is small. Generally speaking, the smaller a poll&rsquo;s sample size, the more prone it is to error. And the two weekly polls in question looked only at small slices: The surveys were based, respectively, on feedback from 118 and 171 respondents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Reuters&rsquo; own polling editor, the sample sizes for this particular poll &quot;were too small to reliably suggest any shift in public opinion.&quot; Chris Kahn, Reuters U.S. political polling editor, said the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.aapor.org/Communications/Press-Releases/Understanding-a-credibility-interval%E2%80%9D-and-how-it-d.aspx\">credibility interval</a>&quot; (which is similar to the more familiar margin of error) was +/- 9 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while Trump claimed his approval rating among black men for the week ending April 22 was 11 percent, realistically it could have anywhere from 2 percent to 20 percent. His approval rating the following week for this group was anywhere from 13 percent to 31 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, according to Kahn, the polling &quot;leaves open the possibility that his approval also could have dropped in this time frame.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said news consumers should heed the Reuters polling editor&rsquo;s cautionary notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most polls do not have a large sample of African Americans, and so we have to be very careful in interpreting the results of any single survey. The margin of error is high,&quot; Bowman said. &quot;I would also not rely on a single survey to suggest that something new was occurring.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were unable to find other polls that measured Trump&#39;s African-American support on a weekly basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Online survey</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue with the poll&rsquo;s reliability concerns how it was conducted. Rather than calling randomly generated phone numbers, this poll allowed online respondents to opt-in to the survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In polling terminology, this survey used &quot;a non-probability online sample.&quot; As CNN&rsquo;s director of polling Jennifer Agiesta <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/06/media/president-trump-approval-rating-blacks/index.html?sr=twmoney050618president-trump-approval-rating-blacks0827PMStory\">explained</a>, &quot;those who participated signed up to take the poll rather than being randomly selected,&quot; meaning &quot;there could be bias in the sample.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth who has written extensively about statistics and public policy, cautioned that online polls are highly vulnerable to &quot;selection bias,&quot; whereby the sample of respondents does not accurately reflect a population writ large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s very difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate cross-section using online tools because they are so biased by who is likely to be online and respond to a survey,&quot; Wheelan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump&rsquo;s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans of both sexes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the poll&rsquo;s accuracy, Reuters&rsquo; own polling chief said the sample size was too small to reliably indicate Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poll&rsquo;s reliability is also questionable given online respondents opted-in to the survey, which is less reliable than using a randomly-generated sample.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-05-07T16:06:42.349937", "ruling_date": "2018-05-07T16:43:53", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s misleading claim that Kanye West\u2019s praise doubled his African-American support", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trumps-misleading-claim-kanye-wests-praise-", "ruling_link_text": "Kanye bromance\u2260Trump poll bump", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-5311765?5\">Remarks</a> by President Donald Trump, NRA convention, May 4, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters <a href=\"https://polling.reuters.com/#poll/CP3_2/filters/SC_RACE:2,SEX:1/dates/20180101-20180501/type/week\">poll</a>, April 29, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/06/media/president-trump-approval-rating-blacks/index.html?sr=twmoney050618president-trump-approval-rating-blacks0827PMStory\">How Trump&#39;s false claim about African American support happened</a>,&quot; May 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Charles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth, May 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute, May 7, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I doubled my African-American poll numbers.
