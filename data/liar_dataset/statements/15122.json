It was made during their <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidates-debate-tonight-on-wisn-12/19061630\">televised debate</a> in Milwaukee on March 2, 2018, a month before the April 3, 2018 election for a 10-year term on the high court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Screnock chafed at criticism Dallet made about activities he engaged in before becoming a judge. Then Dallet replied with criticism of his more recent behavior, saying of Screnock:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ll point out some things he&rsquo;s done during the campaign, like vowed to uphold the platform of the NRA.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Screnock did win the NRA&rsquo;s endorsement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did he &quot;vow to uphold&quot; the NRA&rsquo;s platform?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NRA queries candidates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/09/wisconsin-high-court-candidates-rebecca-dallet-and-michael-screnock-divided-over-guns-nra/404119002/\">During the campaign</a>, Screnock hasn&rsquo;t said whether he believes two major gun rights cases were decided properly. Dallet said she thought the rulings &mdash; one by the U.S. Supreme Court, one by the Wisconsin Supreme Court &mdash; were made by &quot;activist&quot; justices. And while Dallet has backed tighter gun regulations, Screnock has said it isn&rsquo;t up to courts to determine the best way to curb gun violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRA, well known for fighting restrictions on the right to bear arms, <a href=\"https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/\">describes itself</a> as &quot;America&rsquo;s foremost defender of Second Amendment rights.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the Feb. 20, 2018 primary election in the Supreme Court race, the group asked Dallet, Screnock and Madison lawyer <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/tim-burns/\">Tim Burns</a>, who was eliminated in the primary, &nbsp;to submit a statement &quot;stating your positions on Second Amendment issues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter said the NRA would use the responses in rating the candidates, and that the ratings would be communicated to NRA members. Only Screnock responded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NRA endorses Screnock</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Dallet&rsquo;s attack on Screnock, her campaign cited a mailing the NRA sent to its members before the primary. <a href=\"http://onewisconsinnow.org/press/what-did-michael-screnock-promise-the-nra/\">The mailing</a>, revealed by the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, urged NRA members to vote for the &quot;pro-Second Amendment&quot; Screnock, saying in part:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Michael Screnock will interpret our Constitution the way our founding fathers intended and has vowed to protect your firearms freedom.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there&rsquo;s the word <em>vowed</em> that Dallet used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s quoting the NRA and not Screnock himself, and it refers to firearms freedom generally, not any particular agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, to what Screnock actually said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Screnock&rsquo;s response to the NRA letter </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know, of course, if Screnock had any private contacts with the NRA in connection with the campaign.
