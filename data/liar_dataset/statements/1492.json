The league published White&#39;s and other candidates&#39; responses in its primary election Voters Guide for the March 2 party primaries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouston led the entire country in job growth? Sounds wondrous. We wondered if White was rightfully bragging.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaty Bacon, White&#39;s spokeswoman, pointed us to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics that White&#39;s campaign used to compare the job growth in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown area to growth in the rest of the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou&#39;re reading right: The White campaign compared Houston&#39;s job growth to job growth in other states. And it found that over his six years as mayor, Houston gained more jobs than any state outside Texas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe skinny: Some 244,100 jobs were added in the Houston area during the period, compared to 156,800 in Washington, the state with the second-highest increase in jobs. Texas was first with 943,000 new jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe confirmed those numbers &mdash; and found a wrinkle the White campaign overlooked. It turns out that Dallas, which gained 265,800 nonfarm jobs from 2003 through 2009, led the country in job growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we noted that that put the Houston area in the number two spot &mdash; in contrast to leading, as White says in the voter guide &mdash; Bacon said: &quot;Even if we&#39;re number two or number three, we&#39;re still leading the nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCheryl Abbot, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, guided us to the way she said most economists gauge job growth &mdash; by the rate at which jobs increase, instead of the gross number of jobs added. By that calculation, Wyoming led the nation with nearly 12 percent job growth during White&#39;s mayoral tenure, followed by Houston (about 10.6 percent), Utah (10.2 percent), Dallas and Texas (both about 9.9 percent).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbbot&#39;s approach seemed reasonable. After all, counting raw job gains for any community or state would give areas with more residents a natural advantage in the competition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy the same token, relatively few jobs in a place with a small population can have an outsized impact, percentage-wise. Take Odessa, with 21.5 percent job growth, or Grand Junction, Colo., with 14.2 percent.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother example of the numbers game: Farouk Shami, a Houston businessman and White&#39;s opponent in the Democratic primary, has said that the ranks of Houston&#39;s unemployed increased by 42,000 people on White&#39;s watch. By singling out the raw number, Shami downplays factors including whether employment increased too as population grew, not to mention a devastating recession that affected the entire country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo matter how the job numbers are sliced, Houston experienced significant job gains while White was mayor. It added more nonfarm jobs than any other state during that time &mdash; but still, fewer jobs than Dallas. By percentage, Houston boasted the second highest rate of nonfarm job growth (San Antonio was first) among the 10 biggest cities in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouston was among the national leaders. But it wasn&#39;t No. 1.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate White&#39;s statement as False.&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-17T18:29:07.141528", "ruling_date": "2010-02-17T22:36:27", "ruling_headline": "White says Houston led the nation in job growth", "ruling_headline_slug": "white-says-houston-led-nation-job-growth", "ruling_link_text": "But Houston did enjoy significant job gains when White was mayor", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tLeague of Women Voters,<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/02102010_lwvguideaus.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LWV voter guide, Austin area\"> Voters Guide: 2010 primary election edition</a>, accessed Feb. 16, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterviews with Cheryl Abbot, regional economist, Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, Feb. 10 and 17, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Ann Hatchitt, communications director at the Texas Workforce Commission, Feb. 15, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Katy Bacon, spokeswoman, and Tom McCasland, analyst, Bill White&#39;s gubernatorial campaign, Feb. 12 and 16, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/#employment\" target=\"_blank\">Employment, Hours and Earnings &mdash; State and Metro areas,</a> accessed Feb. 16, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?series_id=SMU48264200000000001&amp;data_tool=XGtable\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Total Nonfarm State Area Employment Hours and Earning, Houston,\">Total Nonfarm State Area Employment Hours and Earning, Houston,</a> accessed Feb. 15<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?series_id=SMU48191000000000001&amp;data_tool=XGtable\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Total Nonfarm State Area Employment Hours and Earning, Dallas,\">Total Nonfarm State Area Employment Hours and Earning, Dallas,</a> accessed Feb. 15</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tForbes, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/05/cities-jobs-employment-leadership-careers-cx_tw_0105cities.html\" target=\"_blank\">10 cities for job growth in 2009,</a> by Tara Weiss, Jan. 5, 2009</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNew Geography, <a href=\"http://www.newgeography.com/content/00741-all-cities-rankings-2009-new-geography-best-cities-job-growth\" target=\"_blank\">All cities rankings &mdash; 2009 New Geography best cities for job growth,</a> accessed Feb. 17, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBill White for Texas, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/021710_whitememo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Memo concerning total jobs added between December 2003 and December 2009,</a> Feb. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBill White for Texas, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/021710_household.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Household survey numbers,</a> Feb. 2, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBill White for Texas, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/021710_payroll.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Payroll survey numbers,</a> Feb. 2, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Former mayor of Houston", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 294, "last_name": "White", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "bill-white", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Whitemug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/294/", "total_count": 26, "true_count": 6, "website": "https://www.facebook.com/BillWhiteTexas"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;As Houston&#39;s mayor, I helped our area lead the nation in job growth.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a questionnaire ", "statement_date": "2010-02-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
