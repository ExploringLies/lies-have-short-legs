Scott Walker a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/04/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flop-pathway-citizenship/\">Half Flip</a> for inconsistencies in how he framed his views on what to do about millions of illegal immigrants currently in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our focus was on Walker&rsquo;s comments in light of a 2013 <a href=\"http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2015/02/17/scott-walker-immigration-path-citizenship-wausau-interview-amnesty-border/23558209/\">Wausau Daily Herald interview </a>in which he clearly agreed &quot;it makes sense&quot; that people could not only stay here but get citizenship with the right mix of penalties and waiting periods and other requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker had muddied the waters in a Feb. 1, 2015 interview on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-gov-scott-walker/story?id=28605893&amp;singlePage=true\">ABC&rsquo;s &quot;This Week&quot; program</a> by declaring he was not for &quot;amnesty&quot; for those residents. Critics opposed to a &quot;pathway&quot; to legal citizenship disagreed, calling his position just that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In assigning Walker a Half Flip, which is defined by a partial change in position or inconsistent statements on an issue, we noted &quot;the truth is that we don&rsquo;t really know whether he has a completely new position, because he wasn&rsquo;t asked to clarify his views in detail.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Worth noting: Two days after we issued the Half Flip, Walker in a Fox interview <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=777432655645954\">accused the Wausau newspaper of misquoting him</a> despite video proving otherwise.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s position became a whole lot clearer in a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2015/03/01/gov-walker-cpac-record-wisconsin-rep-scalise-talks-dhs-funding-fight#p//v/4087171184001\">March 1, 2015 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with the public perception that he was equivocating on the issue <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/scottwalker\">as he weighs a 2016 presidential run</a>, Walker tried to better define his position. That prompted us to return to the Flip-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressed by Wallace in the interview, Walker at first continued to say he didn&rsquo;t believe in amnesty, while not disavowing his endorsement of a path to citizenship in the 2013 Wausau interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> <em>The question was, can you envision a world where if these people paid a penalty, that they would have a path to citizenship? And you said, sure, that makes sense.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker</strong>: <em>I believe there&#39;s a way that you can do that...</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Walker switched course when Wallace persisted:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wallace</strong>: <em>But you said you supported it.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker:</strong> <em>And my view has changed. I&#39;m flat out saying it. I&#39;m -- candidates can say that. Sometimes they don&#39;t. I&#39;m saying my --</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> <em>So, you&#39;ve changed from 2013?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walker:</strong> <em>Absolutely. I look at the problems we&#39;ve experienced for the last few years. I&#39;ve talked to governors on the border and others out there. I&#39;ve talked to people all across America. And the concerns I have is that we need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in place a system that works. A legal immigration system that works.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>And part of doing this is put the onus on employers, getting them E-Verify and tools to do that. But I don&#39;t think you do it through amnesty.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Walker now says he&rsquo;s changed his mind since agreeing that some pathway to citizenship makes sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There may still be a bit of wiggle room in his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in our view Walker&rsquo;s declarations now make this a Full Flop, which we define as a complete change in position. Indeed, he agreed he had &quot;absolutely&quot; changed his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\"><u>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</u></a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-05T10:48:58.479402", "ruling_date": "2015-03-06T09:45:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker disavows support for path to citizenship", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-disavows-support-path-citizenship", "ruling_link_text": "Now says he \"absolutely\" has changed view", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2015/03/01/gov-walker-cpac-record-wisconsin-rep-scalise-talks-dhs-funding-fight#p//v/4087171184001\">video and transcript</a> of appearance by Gov.
