Charlie Crist, Republican lawmakers said their plan protects important  priorities such as education while the state is still emerging from the  recession. In a floor speech on the last day of the 2010 legislative  session, state Rep. Anitere Flores, the chief education budget writer in  the House, noted that per-pupil spending slightly increased this year &ndash;  despite the tough times.<br /> <br /> \"The facts are very clear,\" said  Flores, a Republican from Miami. \"We all knew going into this year that  we were going to have to cut over $3 billion.<br /> <br /> \"At a time when  Floridians had less &hellip; At a time when Floridians have sent us $3 billion  less of their funding, to be able to say that we kept our promise to you  guys &ndash; funding education &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s something we should be proud  of.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> We were curious if she was right about Floridians sending  $3 billion less. We contacted her office for clarification but she did  not return our calls.<br /> <br /> Her underlying point -- that lawmakers had a  difficult budget year -- was correct. As lawmakers cobbled together the  2010-11 budget, the deficit -- the difference between state revenues  and the money needed to pay for key services -- was $3.2 billion. (If  you only include what lawmakers termed the \"critical needs,\" the deficit shrunk to $1.1 billion.)<br /> <br /> But the reason for the budget squeeze  wasn't because Floridians were sending $3 billion less in tax money. The  amount of general revenue actually went up from $21 billion in last  year&rsquo;s budget to $22.9 billion for the new budget -- an 8 percent <em>increase</em>.<br /> <br /> That's  largely because last year lawmakers balanced the budget by hiking taxes and fees <em><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/mar/08/charlie-justice/charlie-justice-says-legislature-raised-2-billion-/\" target=\"_blank\">to   the tune of $2.2 billion</a></em>. So contrary to what Flores  said, Floridians sent more money to Tallahassee, not less.<br /> <br /> In  fact, the reason for this year's budget crunch was that expenses -- particularly  mandatory ones such as Medicaid -- went up substantially.<br /> <br /> The  largest built-in cost increase is for Florida's Medicaid system, which  serves the poor and disabled. To qualify for federal stimulus money, the  state had to keep services at roughly the same level. As the ranks of  the poor swelled during the recession, more people were added to  Medicaid. Spending on that program jumped $1.8 billion this year, for a  total of more than $19 billion.<br /> <br /> We should note that the budgets were propped up with stimulus cash from the federal government: $5 billion last year and  $2.4 billion this year. But we don't think that's what Flores was referring to when she mentioned the $3 billion reduction.</p>\r\n<p>So to recap, looking at the overall budget, it's clear spending has  increased. Last year, lawmakers passed a $66.5 billion budget. This year, the spending plan totaled $70.4 billion &ndash; almost $4 billion more.<br /> <br /> Bottom  line: the state can still have a deficit while bringing in more  funding, which is just the case this year. Flores misspoke when she said  Floridians have sent the government less money. They've done just the  opposite. Her statement earns a False.</p>\r\n<p>UPDATE: Flores e-mailed PolitiFact after this item was published and said she inartfully worded her statement and meant to refer to the budget shortfall, not the amount of revenue the state brought in.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-05T17:57:47.583115", "ruling_date": "2010-05-05T18:59:05", "ruling_headline": "Anitere Flores says Floridians have sent $3 billion less in taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "anitere-flores-says-floridians-have-sent-3-billion", "ruling_link_text": " They've actually sent more", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rep.
