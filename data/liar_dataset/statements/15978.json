(Kavanaugh narrowly passed the Senate&rsquo;s confirmation vote and was sworn in Oct. 6.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post has been shared more than 12,200 times since then, but the misattribution has been around a lot longer. A user <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/48955-when-the-debate-is-lost-slander-becomes-the-tool-of?page=6\">posted the quote on Goodreads</a> in 2008, and the quote has been circulating ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/\">Socrates didn&rsquo;t write anything</a> himself, so the picture of who he was and what he said is reliant on others&rsquo; writings. Plato and Xenophon wrote about Socrates and slander but not in the context of lost debates, said Christopher Moore, a philosophy and classics assistant professor at Penn State. &nbsp;Socrates believed those who slandered him hated philosophy and truth, but he didn&rsquo;t call them losers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Plato&rsquo;s &quot;Apology,&quot; Socrates points to his effort to find men smarter than himself as the root of slander against him, according to Debra Nails, a Michigan State University philosophy professor emeritus. When Socrates decided other men weren&rsquo;t as smart as him, those men didn&rsquo;t like him very much. However, there&#39;s no evidence of him saying any version of the viral image quote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plato&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s versions of Socrates were not interested in debates as something that could be won or lost, at least not by an individual, according to Christopher Rowe, Durham University classics and ancient history professor emeritus. In Socrates&rsquo; view, only truth could defeat anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Middle school essayists love to start with a good philosophical quote or a dictionary definition, but this supposed Socratic saying originates from the internet, not from a textbook.
