This could get good.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with Ryan&rsquo;s &quot;Roadmap,&quot; a plan that has helped put Ryan on the political map, but one that does not have universal support among the GOP leadership in Washington.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/\">examined the </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/\">roadmap</a> in August 2010, after President Barack Obama alluded to it in saying GOP leaders are backing privatization plans that would tie Social Security benefits &quot;to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf adopted, Ryan&rsquo;s plan would enable workers under 55 to, voluntarily, invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in funds managed by the government. As Politifact National noted: &quot;That&#39;s a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is starting off on the wrong road with its claim about the roadmap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for the ties to Ryan, this is old-fashioned guilt by association ... and there ain&rsquo;t much association, at least when it comes to the Social Security issue.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Tranel</strong>, a Cuba City dairy farmer, is making his second attempt to unseat Garthwaite, a second-term Assembly Democrat. The mail piece that claims he &quot;sides with those who want to privatize Social Security&quot; says its proof is a newspaper <a href=\"http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=294831\">article.</a> In the article, Tranel expresses admiration for Ryan -- but there&rsquo;s no mention of Social &nbsp;Security.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Dennis Clinard</strong>, a retired U.S. Army master sergeant from Cataract, is seeking to unseat first-term Rep. Mark Radcliffe, D-Black River Falls. A flier says &quot;Washington politicians who wants (sic) to privatize Social Security are the fund-raising muscle behind&quot; Clinard&rsquo;s campaign. The proof listed in the flier is Ryan&rsquo;s appearance at a fundraiser for Clinard. It took in $7,250, according to a state GOP official, or about 15 percent of the $46,357 Clinard&rsquo;s campaign has raised in 2010.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<strong>Howard Marklein</strong>, a Wilson Creek accountant, is running for an open seat against Mineral Point Democrat John Simonson, a retired University of Wisconsin-Platteville economics professor. A mail piece says Marklein is &quot;backed by Washington, D.C., politicians who want to privatize Social Security.&quot; &nbsp;McGrorty said the proof is a <a href=\"http://www.howardmarklein.com/photos.php\">picture of Ryan and Marklein </a>on Marklein&rsquo;s campaign website.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe could go on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA GWC radio ad says some tea party candidates want to eliminate Social Security and &quot;we have one right here, this guy Jack Cummings.&quot; Cummings, an Endeavor farmer, is challenging first-term Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo. McGrorty&rsquo;s defense: The ad talks about a number of issues and doesn&rsquo;t say that Cummings wants to eliminate Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHmmm .... &quot;We have one right here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Assembly Democrat Ted Zigmunt of Francis Creek also uses a flier to accuse his Republican opponent, Andre Jacque, of supporting privatization of Social Security. A campaign aide cited Jacque&rsquo;s endorsement by the <a href=\"http://www.rlc.org/\">Republican Liberty Caucus</a>, but no statement Jacque has made about Social Security.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow do the targeted candidates respond to all of this?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrian Pleva, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Republican Assembly Campaign Committee, said none of them supports -- or has made statements in support of -- privatizing or eliminating Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy would they? They&rsquo;re not running for Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn any case, we could not find any such statements. And the Greater Wisconsin Committee could not provide any.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, on two of the fliers, one of the check-our-facts citations is a <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3114\">report</a> by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. The report predicts cuts in Social Security benefits would result from Ryan&rsquo;s plan, but that doesn&rsquo;t address the question of privatization, and the report doesn&rsquo;t mention the targeted candidates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you&rsquo;re sensing a theme here, so are we.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn targeting Republicans in races that could shift the balance of power in the state Assembly, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is taking a page from the national Democratic playbook -- and misusing it. To play to fears of seniors and others, the group labels a proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, as privatizing Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven if the plan did privatize Social Security (in our view it does not), the group has offered no evidence that the GOP Assembly candidates back it. The &quot;proof&quot; cited borders on absurd: One candidate praised Ryan, one got his picture taken with him and a third had Ryan appear at his campaign fundraiser.
