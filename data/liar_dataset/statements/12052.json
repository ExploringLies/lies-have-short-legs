Donald Trump, though, suggested the United States cut back on foreign aid and other military spending in order to keep Social Security solvent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marco Rubio said he often hears people argue that a lot of taxpayer money can be saved by cutting back on foreign aid. That&rsquo;s not reality, though. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it&#39;s less than 1 percent of our federal budget,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;We can&#39;t just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I&#39;m going to get at fraud and abuse. Let&#39;s get rid of fraud, let&#39;s get rid of abuse, let&#39;s be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you&#39;re going to have to make up.&quot; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to fact-check whether foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the federal budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount the United States spends on foreign aid depends on who is doing the tally, as a 2011 <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R40213.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Congressional Research Service report</u></a> explained. Different agencies include different elements when they calculate what the United States spends on foreign aid. We&#39;ll use 2013 as an example, the most recent year for all four sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/hist.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The federal budget</u></a> only includes programs that fall under the International Affairs section of the budget, specifically sections 151 and 152. It says $32.5 billion was spent in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The U.S. Overseas Loans &amp; Grants database, also known as the &quot;<a href=\"https://explorer.usaid.gov/reports-greenbook.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Greenbook</u></a>,&quot; developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) uses a broader definition. The latest Greenbook lists the United States as giving $31.9 billion in total economic assistance and $8 billion in total military assistance that year, for a total of $39.9 billion. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of &nbsp;34 developed countries, <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/AidAtAGlance/DACmembers?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=no?&amp;:showVizHome=no#1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>measures foreign aid</u></a> by calendar year and excludes all military assistance. It says the <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/AidAtAGlance/DACmembers?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=no?&amp;:showVizHome=no#1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>United States spent $31.3 billion</u></a> in &quot;official developmental assistance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;And the CRS has its own total that includes &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43901.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>foreign operations</u></a>&quot; plus food aid, usually found in the agriculture section of the budget. It pegged the amount at $35.74 billion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the range goes from $31.3 billion to $39.9 billion. On a total federal budget of just under $3.5 trillion, that&#39;s 0.9 percent to less than 1.2 percent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, we found multiple reports that put the figure in the ballpark of what Rubio mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://fiscalfactcheck.crfb.org/we-can-solve-our-debt-situation-by-cutting-waste-fraud-abuse-earmarks-andor-foreign-aid/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget</u></a> wrote in 2015 that &quot;foreign aid represents a total of 0.7 percent of the budget, or 1 percent if military aid is included. That means fully eliminating foreign aid would save only $35 billion or $40 billion per year &ndash; a very small fraction of projected annual deficits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not much different than historical figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R40213.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> in 2011 stated that foreign assistance spending represents about 3 percent of the discretionary budget authority and just over 1 percent of total budget authority each year since 1977. For the 2010 fiscal year, foreign assistance totaled $39.4 billion, or 1.1 percent of the budget,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To further complicate things, these tallies usually don&#39;t include non-traditional foreign aid, where other United States agencies engage in activities that most people would put under the category of foreign aid, such a joint research on pollution in other countries conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is estimated that these non-traditional sources of assistance equaled about $12.6 billion&quot; during the 2009 fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That would have raised the total actually spent on foreign aid to $47.5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said foreign aid &quot;is less than 1 percent of our federal budget.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several reports put the amount of foreign aid in the ballpark of what Rubio said at the GOP debate -- and it has been consistently in the single digits or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note: </strong><em>We updated this story on March 14, 2016, with additional information from the U.S. Overseas Loans &amp; Grants database.
