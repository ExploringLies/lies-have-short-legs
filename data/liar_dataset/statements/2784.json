The state Department of Public Instruction says the MPS board would have to determine if it is possible and the city attorney has not researched the question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll leave it to students of finance to sort out if bankruptcy is the right approach to take. But we were struck by one of the claims Donovan made in stating his case. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tArguing that MPS&rsquo;s pension and health benefits are &quot;unsustainable and overly generous,&quot; Donovan pointed to the district&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://mpsportal.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/portal/server.pt/comm/budget___finance/339/fy_11_proposed_budget/43239\">2010-2011 </a><a href=\"http://mpsportal.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/portal/server.pt/comm/budget___finance/339/fy_11_proposed_budget/43239\">budget</a> and said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;MPS will provide 77 cents in employee benefits for every dollar it spends on wages.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWait a minute. Don&rsquo;t most employers -- even public sector ones -- pay far less in benefits for every $1 in wages?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with Donovan&rsquo;s specific claim, then take a look at his larger point -- that MPS benefits are excessive, taking limited money away from the classroom.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn making his claim, Donovan said the 77 cent figure came from the city&rsquo;s Legislative Reference Bureau, which is the research staff for the Common Council.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn turn, the reference bureau said it came from a March 2010 <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/86731567.html\">column</a> written by education writer Alan Borsuk in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Borsuk said the figure came from an <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/100302bb_SPB.pdf\">estimate</a> MPS made that month, in developing the school district&rsquo;s 2010-2011 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy the time Donovan made his statement in late September, however, the district had revised its estimate to a somewhat smaller number: <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/May+2010+FAQ+English.pdf\">74 cents</a>. That is where the figure remained after the School Board <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/105500763.html\">approved the </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/105500763.html\">budget</a> in October 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Donovan is generally on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut some additional clarification is in order. Donovan&rsquo;s statement suggests the pay-to-benefits ratio applies to the cost of current employees only.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen MPS calculates its benefits in this fashion, it also includes the cost of providing benefits -- including pensions and health care -- to retirees. The district could not separate those costs for us, but that approach makes the figure higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow does the 74-cent figure compare?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what some other local governments estimate they will spend in 2011 on benefits -- for employees and retirees -- for every $1 spent on wages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tCity of Milwaukee: 48 cents (for general employees).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRacine Unified School District: 57 cents</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMilwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District: 59 cents.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, Milwaukee County -- struggling with the cost of enhanced pension benefits that led to officials being removed from office -- projects it will pay $1 in benefits for each dollar it pays in wages in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll right, the bell is about to ring, so we&rsquo;ll wrap up our lesson.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn calling on Milwaukee Public Schools to file for bankruptcy, Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan said that for every $1 MPS will spend in 2011 on wages, it will spend another 77 cents on benefits. The figure was off a bit, since he used an early estimate -- the actual number is 74 cents. And it&rsquo;s a little confusing for taxpayers, since it rolls in costs related to retirees, not just current employees. But his larger point -- that MPS pays a lot more in benefits than other local governments pay -- is on the money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Donovan&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-09T18:26:17.452976", "ruling_date": "2010-11-10T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Alderman says Milwaukee Public Schools spends 77 cents on employee benefits for every dollar it spends on salaries", "ruling_headline_slug": "alderman-says-milwaukee-public-schools-spends-77-c", "ruling_link_text": "The district packs in health care and pensions for retirees, but taxpayers still get a big punch", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterviews, Marquette University senior fellow in law and public policy Alan Borsuk, Nov. 3 and 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan, <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/ccCouncil/2010PDF/08MPSbankruptstatement.pdf\">news release</a>, MPS failures continue to fuel poverty in Milwaukee, Sept. 29, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan, Nov. 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoicemail message, Milwaukee City Attorney Grant Langley, Nov. 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Milwaukee County Controller Scott Manske, Nov. 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/86731567.html\">Simple change could ease MPS budget crunch</a>, March 6, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/103929588.html\">Milwaukee now fourth poorest city in nation</a>, Sept. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/105500763.html\">Milwaukee School Board approves budget</a>, Oct. 22, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Milwaukee Public Schools spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin, Nov. 3 and 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Public Schools, <a href=\"http://mpsportal.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/portal/server.pt/comm/budget___finance/339/fy_11_proposed_budget/43239\">Guide to MPS budget documents</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Public Schools, <a href=\"http://www2.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/portal/FY11-Overview.pdf\">Superintendent&rsquo;s Fiscal Year 2011 Proposed Budget</a>, May 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Public Schools, <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/May+2010+FAQ+English.pdf\">Frequently asked questions -- the superintendent&rsquo;s proposed FY11 budget</a> (pages 50-51)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee School Board, Committee on Strategic Planning and Budget <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/100302bb_SPB.pdf\">agenda</a>, March 2, 2010 (page 9 of document, page 5 of pdf)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, state Department of Public Instruction spokesman Patrick Gasper, Nov. 4, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Member of Milwaukee Common Council", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Bob", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 832, "last_name": "Donovan", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "bob-donovan", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bob_Donovan.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/832/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://city.milwaukee.gov/district8"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tIn 2011, Milwaukee Public Schools &quot;will provide 77 cents in employee benefits for every dollar it spends on wages.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news release", "statement_date": "2010-09-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
