We vote for Mr. Trump! Yes, Mr. Trump! We love you, we love you all the way to the White House!&quot; Myriam Witcher <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osjgkTVt78k\">said</a> enthusiastically into a microphone, flailing her arms up in the air while gripping an American flag and a <em>People</em> magazine with Trump on the cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Witcher, an immigrant from Colombia, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqrrnCw0EWQ\">garnered attention</a> for her lavish praises during the October 2015 rally in Las Vegas, particularly because Trump had presented a hard-line immigration stance, including talk&nbsp;of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/29/politics/donald-trump-immigration-plan-healthcare-flip-flop/\">mass deportation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after her on-stage appearance, <a href=\"http://www.hoylosangeles.com/hoyla-web-colombiana-que-se-dijo-enamorada-de-donald-j-trump-story.html\">rumors</a> spread that Witcher had been deported. A PolitiFact Texas reader recently emailed us saying reports of her deportation were being shared widely, including on Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered, where&rsquo;s Witcher?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still on U.S. soil, Witcher told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rumors of her deportation started last year despite being a naturalized U.S. citizen, Witcher said via a phone interview. Though she lives in Las Vegas, Witcher on Nov. 30 said she was in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the rumors, &quot;up to this day, I&rsquo;m still deported,&quot; Witcher said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t waste my time with that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Satirical post and other sites</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 9, 2015, the day after Witcher appeared next to Trump, a Spanish-language satirical website based in Colombia <a href=\"http://www.actualidadpanamericana.com/adivina-paso-la-colombiana-le-declaro-amor-trump/\">posted</a> an article headlined, &quot;They deport Colombian who declared her love to Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Actualidad Panamericana</em>&rsquo;s 257-word satirical post said Witcher&rsquo;s return to Colombia was expected after a quick deportation order from immigration authorities. The piece said Witcher&rsquo;s immigration papers showed &quot;serious inconsistencies&quot; and that her real name was &quot;Miriam Encanto&quot; -- a spelling variation of her first name and a word for her last name that in English means &quot;charm.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post says that Witcher was picked up by immigration authorities while having dinner with Trump, and that enforcement officials showed up after receiving a call from a &quot;patriot with a toupee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <em>Actualidad Panamericana</em> editor said they believe rumors of Witcher&rsquo;s deportation surged from their post. On its website, <em>Actualidad Panamericana</em> <a href=\"http://www.actualidadpanamericana.com/aviso-legal/\">says</a> its goal is to entertain and that all its content is fiction and does not correspond with reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talks of Witcher&rsquo;s deportation are also posted on another Spanish-language website, <em>Coyotitos.com</em>, a site that lacks information detailing who&rsquo;s behind it and the mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://coyotitos.com/la-hispana-que-apoyo-a-donald-trump-ha-sido-deportada-por-el-departamento-de-migracion/\">article on Witcher</a> and other posts don&rsquo;t have publication dates or bylines indicating who wrote them. Their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Coyotitos-1469722070017616/\">Facebook page</a> says they are a media/news company, but they did not return a message requesting more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Coyotitos</em>&rsquo; post about Witcher is headlined, &quot;Hispanic woman who supported Donald Trump has been deported by the Department of Migration.&quot; (There is no such department.) The article <a href=\"http://coyotitos.com/la-hispana-que-apoyo-a-donald-trump-ha-sido-deportada-por-el-departamento-de-migracion/\">says</a> different media outlets have started to report what happened to Witcher, &quot;who has been deported for not having legal &lsquo;immigration status.&rsquo;&quot; The post warns the information has not been officially confirmed despite being widespread and that it should be taken with caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Media interviews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthony Avellaneda, a journalist for&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://eltiempolv.com/\">El Tiempo</a></em>, a Hispanic publication of the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>, said he has occasionally interviewed Witcher. He quoted her in an <a href=\"http://eltiempolv.com/noticias/opiniones-divididas-sobre-propuesta-migratoria-donald-trump\">article</a> posted Sept. 9, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s still here in Las Vegas.&nbsp;She has not been deported,&quot; Avellaneda said, adding that news of her removal stemmed from satirical posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Witcher also was featured in a video <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/video/donald-trumps-groesster-latino-fan-video-1716693.html\">published Nov. 1</a> by a German publication, <em>Spiegel Online</em>. Witcher appears standing outside the Trump International hotel in Las Vegas and reaffirms her admiration for Trump. Witcher says she&rsquo;s a&nbsp;citizen and sports a Trump campaign pin on her blazer as well as a &quot;Vote Early Today&quot; sticker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an online search page to <a href=\"https://locator.ice.gov/odls/homePage.do\">locate detainees</a> who are in custody or who have been released within the last 60 days. There&rsquo;s no result for Myriam Witcher.

She is married to a native U.S. citizen from Texas, who is a veteran of the U.S. Navy submarine service,&quot; reads Witcher&rsquo;s book author description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Witcher campaigned for Trump, posting dozens of videos on her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0G4Z-2krCQJnL9iAkvwXBg/videos?sort=dd&amp;view=0&amp;shelf_id=0\">YouTube channel</a> recapping his immigration plan and encouraging viewers to vote for him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gail J.

The post said Witcher had been ordered deported and would be returning to Colombia within days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Journalists have interviewed Witcher on U.S. soil in the past few months.
