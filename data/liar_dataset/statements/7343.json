Chris Christie said federal officials approved $60 billion in aid within just 10 days of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd that Katrina aid was authorized without members of Congress even casting roll call votes, according to the Republican governor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn between pulling doughnuts out of his pockets, Christie offered that background during his appearance Monday on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman.&quot; The late-night host questioned whether the delay in securing Sandy aid could have happened at any point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It didn&rsquo;t happen eight years ago,&quot; Christie told Letterman. &quot;I mean, in Katrina, they approved $60 billion within 10 days of the storm on a voice vote.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe governor&rsquo;s right that about $60 billion in emergency aid was approved in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, but Christie is wrong to claim all of that money was approved &quot;on a voice vote.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a voice vote, members of Congress just shout out &quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; without their individual votes being recorded. But contrary to what Christie said, most of that roughly $60 billion was approved by way of recorded votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor&rsquo;s office did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s explain the different sets of votes on the Katrina aid.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we confirmed in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/03/robert-menendez/hurricane-sandy-aid-still-pending-us-sen-robert-me/\">previous fact-check</a>, the Republican-controlled Congress approved two bills providing $62.3 billion in emergency funding in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, near Buras, La.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Sept. 2, 2005, Congress passed a bill to provide $10.5 billion in emergency aid related to damage caused by Katrina.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe House approved that bill by a voice vote, and the Senate approved the legislation by &quot;unanimous consent.&quot; Under unanimous consent, there is no recorded vote and the bill is considered approved if no one objects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut on Sept. 8, 2005, when Congress approved an additional $51.8 billion in emergency appropriations for Katrina victims, both chambers held recorded votes on the legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bill passed in the House by a 410-11 vote and in the Senate by 97-0. Twelve House members and three senators did not cast ballots on the measure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, although the first bill was approved without any recorded votes, the second bill -- which provided most of the $62.3 billion in funding -- was passed by recorded votes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut just as Christie said, securing federal approval for Sandy aid took much longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three months after Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City, President Barack Obama signed a bill on Jan. 29 to provide about $50 billion in emergency appropriations. The GOP-controlled House had approved the bill on Jan. 15, and the Democrat-led Senate passed it on Jan. 28.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in January, the president signed a bill providing $9.7 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program to assist Sandy victims.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring his appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; Christie claimed that &quot;in Katrina, they approved $60 billion within 10 days of the storm on a voice vote.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut all of that funding was not approved by federal officials shouting &quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; on the House and Senate floors. Congress signed off on $10.5 billion in Katrina aid without recorded votes, but the remaining $51.8 billion was approved by recorded votes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, the governor&rsquo;s overall point is solid. While Hurricane Sandy victims waited three months for federal aid to be approved, Congress had authorized $62.3 billion in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/02/politifact_nj_christie_tells_d.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-05T17:42:59.946945", "ruling_date": "2013-02-06T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie tells David Letterman that $60 billion in Katrina aid was approved \u201con a voice vote\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-tells-david-letterman-60-billion-ka", "ruling_link_text": "Roll call on Katrina", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUay-MaIbmE\">Governor Christie On The Late Show With David Letterman</a>, Feb. 4, 2013<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/03/robert-menendez/hurricane-sandy-aid-still-pending-us-sen-robert-me/\">With Hurricane Sandy aid still pending, U.S. Sen.
