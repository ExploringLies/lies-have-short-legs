The voiceover said, &quot;Wonder where John McCain would take the economy?

The voiceover says, &quot;Where will Lee Fisher take our economy? Just look behind you.&quot; It cuts to a shot of Fisher in the mirror, followed by a series of blue and green signs, roadside and overhead, spelling out the ad&#39;s talking points. It closes with a shot of Fisher in the mirror.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut imitation is also the sincerest form of television, and ads don&#39;t necessarily win or lose points for originality. Our concern is content, and the ad&#39;s three points also display a taste for recycling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst is the statement, &quot;Fisher served as Gov. Strickland&#39;s top official on job creation, yet Ohio has lost almost 400,000 jobs.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/sep/23/rob-portman/rob-portman-raps-lee-fisher-ohios-job-losses-while/\">PolitiFact examined this claim earlier</a>, and rated it Half True. Fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to Ohio, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he is solely responsible for the job losses. And the state didn&rsquo;t lose that many jobs while he was head of the Department of Development.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe spot also asserts that Fisher &quot;even supported Obama&#39;s stimulus that failed to create jobs.&quot; The critical point is the contention that the stimulus failed to create jobs, another claim that PolitiFact has examined and found untrue and, in one case, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/18/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-stimulus-didnt-create-one-new-job/\">rated as Pants on Fire</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWedged between those claims in the Crossroads ad is the assertion that Fisher &quot;wanted a $1.1 billion tax increase which could have driven countless jobs out of state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat charge is new to this campaign, and the claim that PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at. But it&rsquo;s such a blast from the past that you need the Hubble Space Telescope to see it, not a rearview mirror.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked for sources, American Crossroads said the charge is based on Fisher&#39;s support for a plan proposed in 1997 to raise the state sales tax from 5 cents on the dollar to 6 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe so-called plan was a state ballot issue proposed by then-Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican, who was leaving office to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by John Glenn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth candidates to replace Voinovich -- Fisher, the Democrat, and Secretary of State Bob Taft, the Republican -- voiced support for the ballot issue. Fisher also vowed that as governor he would not seek any increase in state sales or income taxes without voter consent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 1-cent sales tax was intended to generate $1.1 billion a year -- $550 million for schools and $550 million for homeowner property-tax relief. Voters rejected it at the polls in May 1998.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the way it is used in the ad is misleading:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe ad gives no indication that the issue is 12 years old.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRaising it between a reference to Fisher&rsquo;s term as state development director, 2007 to 2009, and a claim about the stimulus, passed in 2009, creates the impression that the issue is current or recent.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThere is no hint that the plan was an attempt to deal with school funding and that it had bipartisan support.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is true that Fisher, as well as leading Republicans in Ohio at the time, supported the sales tax issue that would have raised $1.1 billion. That&rsquo;s one element of accuracy. But the ad leaves out important details needed to fully present the statement in proper context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate it Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/10/american_crossroads_attacks_le.html\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-05T16:48:27.758901", "ruling_date": "2010-10-05T16:45:00", "ruling_headline": "American Crossroads attacks Lee Fisher for support of $1.1 billion sales tax ballot issue for education", "ruling_headline_slug": "american-crossroads-attacks-lee-fisher-support-11-", "ruling_link_text": "A statewide ballot issue that had bipartisan support", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNew York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/us/26rove.html\">Rove Returns, With Team, Planning G.O.P.
