Some voters see flip-flops as a sign of hypocrisy while others may view them as a politician evolving on an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that for years DeWine has opposed the Affordable Care Act, which included Medicaid expansion. At times he has been vague when pressed to give a yes-or-no answer on Medicaid expansion, and he&rsquo;s repeated a talking point that he wanted to reform the program. In July, he came out in support of the expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">DeWine on Medicaid expansion before the 2018 campaign</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On DeWine&rsquo;s first day in office as attorney general in 2011, he authorized Ohio to join the multistate lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His<a href=\"https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/January-2011/Attorney-General-DeWine-Authorizes-Action-to-Chall\"> statement</a> called the law a &quot;huge federal overreach&quot; and criticized the individual mandate. The <a href=\"http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/JDAS-8M5KCL/$file/HC_StatesPetitiontoUSSupremeCt.pdf\">lawsuit </a>challenged a few core provisions of the law, including Medicaid expansion, which came with an implied threat that the government would withhold funding unless states complied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When DeWine spelled out what he thought were the sins of the law in an op-ed in the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/27/romneys-individual-mandate-problem/\">Washington Times</a></em> in 2012, he included Medicaid expansion, although Ohio had not yet signed on to expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Obamacare is, quite simply, the federal version of Romneycare,&quot; DeWine wrote the day after the lawsuit was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. &quot;All of the problems that we have seen unfold in Massachusetts -- doctor shortages, Medicaid expansion and escalating health insurance costs -- are already starting to take place across the country as Obamacare is implemented.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate and<a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/court-holds-that-states-have-choice-whether-to-join-medicaid-expansion/\"> ruled</a> that states would have a choice about expanding Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next year, Ohio <a href=\"https://www.healthinsurance.org/ohio-medicaid/\">Republican Gov. John Kasich</a> expanded Medicaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, DeWine<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170628/dewine-not-taking-sides-in-showdown-over-medicaid-freeze\"> refused to take sides</a> in the battle between Kasich and the GOP-controlled General Assembly about expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">DeWine&rsquo;s talking point about a third option on Medicaid</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When DeWine launched his campaign for governor in June 2017, he was asked at a <a href=\"https://ohiodems.org/day-one-mike-dewines-gubernatorial-campaign-double-speak-medicaid-expansion/\">forum</a> if he would end Medicaid expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m against Obamacare; this is part of Obamacare,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2017 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf_mifyT4WM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">DeWine said in a TV </a>interview that the Medicaid expansion &quot;has done a lot of good for people who do have an addiction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeWine said that &quot;smart sheriffs&quot; are helping inmates enroll in Medicaid when they leave jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&rsquo;t want that to go away,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the primary, DeWine <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2018/04/live_video_republican_ohio_gov.html\">avoided giving a yes-or-no answer</a> to whether he would maintain Medicaid expansion although he said that it was <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180101/governors-race-qampa--mike-dewine\">&quot;financially unsustainable.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His talking point was that he would pursue a &quot;third way,&quot; which included seeking a <a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2018/04/29/DeWine-touts-self-as-problem-solver.html\">waiver </a>from the federal government to change the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohio already has a <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/which-states-have-approved-and-pending-section-1115-medicaid-waivers/\">pending waiver</a> with the federal government to add work requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">DeWine announces support for Medicaid expansion</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 11, the Ohio State Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.osma.org/OSMA/News/2018NewsQtr3/PAC_Backs_DeWine_for_Governor\">announced</a> that DeWine had gained it&#39;s backing in part because he agreed to keep the Medicaid expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the press conference, DeWine emphasized that he wanted drug addicts to continue getting treatment through Medicaid expansion. He vowed to &quot;keep extended Medicaid coverage for adults&quot; as well as to reform the program to encourage able-bodied adults to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DeWine said that &quot;there is no change&quot; to his Medicaid policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What we said all along is it had to be reformed,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our conclusion</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When DeWine came out in support of Medicaid expansion, his critics accused him of flip-flopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years, DeWine has opposed the Affordable Care Act, which included Medicaid expansion. DeWine&#39;s position has evolved, though. During the primary he said that the program was financially unsustainable and needed reform, but he&#39;s also&nbsp;said that Medicaid expansion helped drug addicts pay for treatment.&nbsp;On July 11, DeWine announced that he would keep Medicaid expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change of positions has happened over the course of several years, but it is a distinct change.
