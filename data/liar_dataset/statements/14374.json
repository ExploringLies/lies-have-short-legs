Not just any plant, but a $10 billion facility that is envisioned as becoming part of a high-tech <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foxconn-announces-launch-of-intelligent-manufacturing-ecosystem-in-us-during-white-house-event-300494861.html\">&quot;ecosystem.&quot;</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, in all the excitement, did Walker go too far in stating how many jobs are coming?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWalker/status/890328411863994371\">a tweet</a> the same day, he declared:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Foxconn is bringing 13,000 high-tech jobs to Wisconsin -- the biggest jobs announcement in our state&rsquo;s history!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving aside the term high-tech,&nbsp;we wondered about the figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that the 13,000 is something more than a goal, though -- at this stage -- considerably less than actual jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Foxconn says</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the White House, Gou <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?431848-1/president-trump-announces-new-manufacturing-jobs-wisconsin\">made no reference</a> to the number of jobs the facility would create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in a <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foxconn-announces-launch-of-intelligent-manufacturing-ecosystem-in-us-during-white-house-event-300494861.html\">news release</a>, Foxconn was notably more measured than Walker was, using the word &quot;potential&quot; in saying the plant would &quot;create 3,000 jobs with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump used the same word, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/07/26/remarks-president-trump-jobs-announcement\">saying</a> 3,000 jobs would be created &quot;at a minimum, with the potential for up to 13,000 jobs in the very near future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, in an interview on the day of the announcement, Walker himself qualified the 13,000 figure as less than certain in discussing $3 billion in incentives Wisconsin is offering Foxconn. &quot;If there&rsquo;s something less than the 13,000 jobs, they don&rsquo;t get as much of an incentive,&quot; he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWdtBJITWPs\">told WTMJ-TV</a> in Milwaukee. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Walker repeated that point in <a href=\"http://wtaq.com/podcasts/the-jerry-bader-show/921/governor-scott-walker-on-foxconn-announcement/\">three</a> <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/139-The-Jay-Weber-Show-28167130/episode/foxconns-10-billion-dollar-deal-gov-28340682/?campid=ls_ihrshow&amp;pname=1176&amp;cid=%2Ffeatured%2Fthe-jay-weber-show%2F\">broadcast</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/07/27/gov-scott-walker-foxconn-jobs-will-create-an-entire-ecosystem-in-wisconn-valley.html?play=1\">interviews</a> the next day, making it clear the company would not get the full $1.5 billion jobs portion of the incentives unless 13,000 jobs are created.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that the 13,000 is something more than a goal, given that Foxconn is entering into a written agreement with the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is there an absolute guarantee that there will be 13,000 jobs? I don&rsquo;t know how Foxconn could guarantee that,&quot; said <a href=\"http://wisconsintechnologycouncil.com/contact/\">Tom Still</a>, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, a nonprofit that advises the governor and the Legislature. &quot;But is there a strategic plan to grow to that level? Absolutely.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, much must occur before any help wanted postings are made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that in 2013, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett announced that Foxconn planned to invest $30 million in a &quot;high-end technology manufacturing facility&quot; with 500 jobs. The company has a small research operation in Harrisburg, Pa., but the factory <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2017/07/26/scott-walker-heads-d-c-trump-prepares-wisconsin-foxconn-announcement/512077001/\">was never built</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And by way of comparison, on the same day of Foxconn&rsquo;s Wisconsin announcement, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/07/26/amazon-goes-hiring-spree-labor-market-tightens/511953001/\">Amazon made</a> a more firm jobs announcement. It said it would hold a job fair on Aug. 2, 2017, at 10 of its shipping sites around the country as part of an effort to fill more than 50,000 U.S. jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said: &quot;Foxconn is bringing 13,000 high-tech jobs to Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving aside the term high-tech,&nbsp;the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer is a long way from even breaking ground on a plant that was only announced the same day Walker made his statement. And the company itself has been more measured, saying the planned plant initially will create 3,000 jobs, &quot;with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the 13,000 is more than talk. Foxconn is pledging a $10 billion investment and the state is offering $3 billion in incentives, with $1.5 billion aimed at the creation of 13,000 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate, but needs clarification -- our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-07-27T17:21:31.819024", "ruling_date": "2017-07-27T18:11:30", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says Foxconn 'bringing' 13,000 jobs to Wisconsin -- what exactly does that mean?
