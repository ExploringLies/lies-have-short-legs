The proceeds of the future drug sales were to fund ISIS, the post read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is nonsense, because obviously Obama had not been arrested. And he was too busy <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/28/warren-troubled-report-wall-street-paid-obama-speech/101037174/\">negotiating $400,000 for speaking appearances</a> to smuggle cocaine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AmericanFlavor.news post was the latest stop for a conspiracy theory that goes back a few weeks. The article linked to a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/h5nBmSxbLss\">YouTube video</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The video was created by <a href=\"http://politicianreviews.com/politicians/denise-stark/\">Denise Stark</a>, a conspiracy theorist who was <a href=\"http://www.stillnessinthestorm.com/2017/03/benjamin-fulford-march-31st-2017-obama-arrested-obama-linked-planed-filled-with-afghan-heroin-and-north-korean-amphetamines-impounded-in-caribbean.html\">citing an online radio show</a> called <em>Stillness in the Storm</em>, a show <a href=\"http://www.stillnessinthestorm.com/p/contact-us.html\">its creators describe as</a> &quot;an ongoing conversation about world events, hidden truths, and empowering information.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stillness in the Storm&rsquo;s website linked to a blog post written by Benjamin Fulford, who on <a href=\"http://benjaminfulford.typepad.com/benjaminfulford/2017/03/obama-linked-planed-filled-with-afghan-heroin-and-north-korean-amphetamines-impounded-in-caribbean-by-benjamin-fulford-march.html\">March 31 had written the piece</a> that later appeared on AmericanFlavor.news. Stillness in the Storm had warned on its site that &quot;Fulford&#39;s claims should not be considered to be true without substantiation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fulford, in turn, used his original post to link to a <a href=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2262.htm\">March 15 screed on WhatDoesItMean.com</a>, a site rife with conspiratorial meanderings. The essay said that Obama had some nebulous link to a fishing boat called<em> Lady Michelle</em>, which had been busted in the Caribbean while smuggling cocaine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post was written by <a href=\"http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/indexsf33778855.htm\">Sorcha Faal</a>, the pseudonym of a conspiracy theorist with a series of posts on WhatDoesItMean.com. Faal&rsquo;s post makes some pretty big leaps in logic, including that George W. Bush and Obama operated cocaine-smuggling operations and that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had ordered their arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo that accompanied Faal&rsquo;s post was of a ship called <em>Lady Michelle</em>, which had been <a href=\"https://www.workboat.com/news/government/coast-guard-scores-record-atlantic-cocaine-bust/\">stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard</a> off the shore of Suriname on Feb. 16, 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four Guyanese men were arrested for transporting 4.2 tons of cocaine worth about $125 million. There&rsquo;s no mention of Japan, or any connection to Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously PunditFact had checked a claim that Obama was arrested at the Canadian border for wiretrapping Trump, which earned a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/09/blog-posting/image-obama-handcuffs-wiretapping-trump-fake-photo/\">Pants On Fire! rating</a>.
