But it is misleading for Trump to say ICE and border patrol officers unanimously endorsed him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council represents 5,000 immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. ICE has about <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/about\">20,000 employees</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2015/07/21/written-testimony-ice-director-senate-committee-judiciary-hearing-titled-%E2%80%9Coversight\">nearly 6,000</a> agents and officers in removal operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/immigration-and-customs-enforcement-officers-endorse-donald-j.-trump-for-pr\">statement from the ICE union posted September 2016 on Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign website</a> says their endorsement of Trump was the first ever by a vote of the membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that same statement, council president Chris Crane&nbsp;said Trump&rsquo;s Democratic opponent&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&nbsp;received 5 percent of that vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other union, the National Border Patrol Council,&nbsp;represents 16,500 border patrol agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The union&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bpunion.org/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/1824-national-border-patrol-council-endorses-donald-trump-for-president\">endorsement</a>&nbsp;was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the <em><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-border-patrol-trump-20160511-snap-story.html\">Los Angeles Times</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The May 2016 <em>Los Angeles Times</em> article <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-border-patrol-trump-20160511-snap-story.html\">reported</a> that agents in El Paso, Texas, had asked their local union to &quot;disavow the endorsement,&quot; but that their attempt failed in a 14-13 vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said ICE and border patrol officers &quot;unanimously endorsed me for president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unions representing ICE and border patrol agents endorsed Trump for president. Not all officers represented by the ICE union voted to endorse Trump, and some border patrol agents in Texas asked their local union to disavow the national union&rsquo;s endorsement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
