Republicans now hold a majority of 40&nbsp;members, including IDC members and a&nbsp;Democrat who sits with the Republican conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video claims members of the IDC cashed in with donors who also contributed to GOP lawmakers. Is that true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Giving money in the Senate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Special interest groups can give money to support candidates in two ways: to candidates directly or to a political party committee. In the State Senate, the Republicans, Democrats and IDC each has its own campaign account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list of donors The Creative Resistance sent us to support its claim is long. Filings from the state Board of Elections show its claim is accurate -- the IDC did get money from real estate, charter school and health care lobbyists. But so did both Republicans and Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some health care examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Greater New York Hospital Association since 2011 has given $1.3 million to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, $625,000 to the Senate Democrat Campaign account and $311,000 to the IDC.</li>\r\n\t<li>Individual members of the IDC outpaced Democrats in donations from the association. They collectively received $16,500 since&nbsp;2011. Individual Democrats collected $6,000 from the organization while Republicans received about $39,000.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Healthcare Association of New York State has given about $810,000 to Republicans between their conference&rsquo;s campaign account and individual members since 2011. The IDC took a total of about $113,000 from the group.&nbsp;Democrats were given $105,000.</li>\r\n\t<li>Both organizations supported more Democrats than Republicans in the State Assembly, suggesting its money goes to whomever is in power.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Charter schools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans in the State Legislature are more likely to support legislation that benefits charter schools. That&rsquo;s reflected through donations they receive from charter school groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of those groups, New Yorkers for Putting Students First and the Coalition for Public Charter Schools, have not given to mainline Senate Democrats since 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They gave about $167,000 to the IDC and its members and about $233,000 to Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eva Moskowitz, the founder of Success Academy Charter Schools, has favored the IDC over Democrats in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her political action committee, Great Public Schools, has given about $66,000 to the IDC and its members since 2011. The PAC gave $114,000 to Senate Republicans, while six members of the mainline Democratic conference were given about $38,000 from the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Real estate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some IDC donors from the real estate industry have ties to President Donald Trump, the video claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest real estate donor on the group&rsquo;s list is the Real Estate Board of New York, a statewide group that advocates for real estate developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Creative Resistance says the group is tied to Trump through his children. Both Eric and Ivanka Trump are <a href=\"https://www.rebny.com/content/rebny/en/directory/directory-search-results.html?q=trump\">members of&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The board has given slightly more than $1 million to the Senate Republican campaign account and members since 2011. The IDC has received about $480,000 while mainline Democrats were given about $207,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The IDC&#39;s response</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IDC responded to the group&#39;s claim with its own analysis of major donors from health care, charter school and real estate lobbyists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;An honest review of campaign finance donations of all Democrats in New York illustrates that these same donors contribute to Democrats across the state, and the Senate&#39;s minority Democratic conference is no exception,&quot; IDC spokesperson Candice Giove said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Creative Resistance said in a video &quot;IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IDC and its members do get money from donors in the lobbyists. But so do mainline Democrats, even if it&rsquo;s less than their IDC colleagues. It&#39;s not true the IDC members benefit while Democrats do not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-11-03T12:07:36.797326", "ruling_date": "2017-11-05T10:01:53", "ruling_headline": "Progressive group accuses Senate splinter group of cashing in with donors", "ruling_headline_slug": "progressive-group-accuses-senate-splinter-group-do", "ruling_link_text": "Not just the IDC", "ruling_state": "New York", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Video: &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mESf-kjuSI\">Lulu Land</a>&quot;, Oct. 24, 2017, The Creative Resistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email conversation with Eric Rockey, spokesperson for The Creative Resistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All contribution data obtained through the New York State Board of Elections website, Oct. 27 - 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/shaping-the-westchester-skyline/\">Shaping the Westchester skyline</a>&quot;, The Real Deal, Jan. 1, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rebny.com/content/rebny/en/directory/directory-search-results.html?q=trump\">REBNY Member Directory, showing Ivanka and Eric Trump</a>.
