Could half of all newborn babies tested at this particular hospital really have marijuana in their system?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deceptive data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad cites a <a href=\"http://www.rmhidta.org/html/2016%20FINAL%20Legalization%20of%20Marijuana%20in%20Colorado%20The%20Impact.pdf\">September 2016 report</a> from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area -- an interagency group focused on combating drug trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the report, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rmhidta.org/html/2016%20FINAL%20Legalization%20of%20Marijuana%20in%20Colorado%20The%20Impact.pdf\">nearly half</a>&quot; of newborns tested in March 2016 at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo, Colo., tested positive for marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for the anti-pot group, also pointed us to a <a href=\"http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/07/11/marijuana-pregnant-thc-positive-babies-colorado/\">July 2016 CBS Denver story</a> on the hospital. The article notes that the head of the neonatal unit, Dr. Steve Simerville, is reporting a &quot;dramatic increase&quot; in newborns with marijuana in their system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the hospital and dug into the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, but St. Mary-Corwin spokeswoman Wendi Dammann said babies have been drug tested at the hospital for at least a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The screening criteria was developed by both local hospitals (St. Mary-Corwin and Parkview) and Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as the numbers cited in the ad, Dammann confirmed that five out of the 11 newborn babies tested in March 2016 did test positive for marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s less than 46 percent -- not half -- of a handful of births in one month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherry-picking one month of data makes the number of newborns who test positive for marijuana seem higher than it actually is. That is not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From January 2016 through September 2016, 403 babies were born at St. Mary-Corwin. About one-quarter of those, or 101, were tested for marijuana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those 101 newborns, 27 tested positive for marijuana in their systems. That&rsquo;s a rate slightly under 27 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in 2015, the hospital saw 519 births. Of the 93 newborn babies tested for marijuana, 31 came up positive for marijuana. That&rsquo;s a rate of 33 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marijuana use during and after pregnancy can be quite harmful. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, exposure to THC &quot;<a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/can-marijuana-use-during-pregnancy-harm-baby\">could have profound and long-lasting consequences</a>&quot; to a baby&rsquo;s brain and behavior, including neurological development. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know how these statistics compared to the country or states where marijuana is not legal, but we could not find much research on that point. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Dr. Edith Allen of Phoenix Children&rsquo;s Hospital, studied drug habits for pregnant women with criteria including personal or family history of drug use at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital and Medical Center between 2006 and 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her study found THC in 431 babies out of 727 mother-baby pairings tested -- almost 60 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Allen pointed out that not every pregnant woman was tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad claimed, &quot;In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That hospital -- St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center -- did have more than 45 percent of their newborn babies tested test positive for marijuana in their systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big issue with the talking point is it cherry-picks one month of data. Overall, from January 2015 through September 2016, almost&nbsp;1 in 3 newborn babies tested for marijuana at St. Mary-Corwin came up positive for marijuana in their systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not half, but it&rsquo;s still pretty high. We rate the ad&rsquo;s claim Half True. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c0486014-62bc-4d7b-a14d-25fb5b447a1d\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c0486014-62bc-4d7b-a14d-25fb5b447a1d</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-31T16:38:08.659433", "ruling_date": "2016-11-03T16:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Anti-recreational marijuana ad cherry-picks data for claim on newborn babies and pot", "ruling_headline_slug": "anti-recreational-marijuana-ad-misleads-claim-newb", "ruling_link_text": "Just one month", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC15, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/state/las-vegas-mogul-sheldon-adelson-is-the-latest-big-name-contributor-to-anti-pot-effort\">Las Vegas mogul Sheldon Adelson is the latest big name contributor to anti-pot effort</a>,&quot; Oct. 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political TV Ad Archive, &quot;<a href=\"http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/PolAd_Marijuana_Children_HealthCare_5q6gv/\">Mistake</a>,&quot; Oct. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rmhidta.org/html/2016%20FINAL%20Legalization%20of%20Marijuana%20in%20Colorado%20The%20Impact.pdf\">The legalization of marijuana in Colorado</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS Denver, &quot;<a href=\"http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/07/11/marijuana-pregnant-thc-positive-babies-colorado/\">Hospitals reporting more babies being born THC-positive</a>,&quot; July 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/can-marijuana-use-during-pregnancy-harm-baby\">Can marijuana use during and after pregnancy harm the baby?</a>&quot; accessed Oct. 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Academy of Pediatrics, &quot;THC and concomitant illicit drug consumption during pregnancy,&quot; accessed Nov. 2, 2016&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy spokeswoman Ciara Archer, Oct. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center spokeswoman Wendi Dammann, Oct. 26-27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Phoenix Children&rsquo;s Hospital Dr. Edith Allen, Nov. 2, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Arizonans ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 3708, "last_name": "for Responsible Drug Policy", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "arizonans-responsible-drug-policy", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ardp-share_80x80.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Arizona", "edition": "Arizona", "edition_slug": "arizona", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 56, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Arizona Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/56/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3708/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://noprop205.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a political advertisement", "statement_date": "2016-10-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 310, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/310/", "subject": "Marijuana", "subject_slug": "marijuana", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/47/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/48/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/14/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Did half of newborns tested at a Colorado hospital test positive for pot?
