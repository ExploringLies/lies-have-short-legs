That would conflict with the views of her running mate John McCain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you still believe that global warming is not man-made?&quot; Gibson asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I believe that man&#39;s activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming, climate change,&quot; Palin said. &quot;Regardless of that, John McCain and I agree that we gotta do something about it, and we have to make sure that we&#39;re doing all we can to cut down on pollution. ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a followup question, she said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m attributing some of man&#39;s activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gibson said he detected a change in her position, but Palin said she hadn&#39;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Show me where I&#39;ve ever said that there&#39;s absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any effect or no effect on climate change. I have not said that. I have said that my belief is there is a cyclical nature of our planet &mdash; warming trends, cooling trends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked for Palin&#39;s previous statements on global warming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, she gave an interview to the Web site Newsmax, which ran the following brief exchange with Palin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Question: &quot;What is your take on global warming and how is it affecting our country?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palin: &quot;A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I&#39;m not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also gave an interview to a Fairbanks newspaper in December 2007, discussing her first year as governor. The story states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A few months into her term, Palin directed a group of state commissioners to develop a strategy for addressing climate change. State lawmakers had already formed a climate commission, but the administration up until then had nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;&#39;I&#39;m not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity,&#39; Palin said Monday, &#39;but I&#39;m not going to put my head in the sand and pretend there aren&#39;t changes.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are two clear statements that Palin didn&#39;t believe that human activity contributed to global warming. She agreed that global warming was real but implied that it had non-human causes. In her interview with Gibson, she said that &quot;man&#39;s activities certainly can be contributing.&quot; We rule this one a Full Flop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:02.143484", "ruling_date": "2008-09-12T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Earlier, she didn't \"attribute it to being man-made\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "earlier-she-didnt-attribute-it-to-being-man-made", "ruling_link_text": "Earlier, she didn't \"attribute it to being man-made\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Good Morning America, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/gma\"> Charles Gibson interview with Sarah Palin </a> , Sept. 12, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsmax, <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\"> Palin Speaks to Newsmax About McCain, Abortion </a> , Aug. 29, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, <a href=\"http://newsminer.com/\"> One year later, Palin making progress in role of governor </a> , Dec. 4, 2007, accessed via archive search</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 20, "first_name": "Sarah", "half_true_count": 9, "home_state": "Alaska", "id": 63, "last_name": "Palin", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "sarah-palin", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-sarahpalin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/63/", "total_count": 67, "true_count": 14, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>On whether global warming is man-made.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Fairbanks, Alaska", "statement_date": "2008-09-11", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Most scientists agree that climate change is real and humans are causing it.
