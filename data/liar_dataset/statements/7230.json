Chris Christie&rsquo;s State of the State address Tuesday, but New Jersey&rsquo;s economic woes weren&rsquo;t totally forgotten.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie talked repeatedly of Garden State resilience and making the tough choices, from tenure reform to hardline collective bargaining to dealing with huge amounts of debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In fiscal year 2011, the picture was even worse: a projected $11 billion deficit &ndash; on a budget of $29 billion &ndash; in percentage terms, the worst in America,&quot; Christie told a packed statehouse in Trenton as he reviewed the state&rsquo;s economic landscape. He also noted that as in previous years, the state budget was balanced without raising taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTuesday&rsquo;s address marks the fourth time since 2011 that PolitiFact New Jersey has heard that $11 billion figure from Christie. The third time was during Christie&rsquo;s keynote address in August at the Republican National Convention in Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we did in August, we&rsquo;re looking only at the claim of an $11 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2011 and the budget being balanced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, Christie has balanced the budget every budget year, as required by the state Constitution. So, that claim is accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there&rsquo;s a problem with his claim about a projected $11 billion deficit for fiscal year 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s explain. The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal year 2011 budget, when Christie proposed his first spending plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the state does not have to meet all of its obligations because the budget supersedes statute.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s basically what Christie did in his first budget.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tHe skipped a &nbsp;$3 billion pension payment, didn&rsquo;t fully fund the school aid formula, and didn&rsquo;t fully fund the state&rsquo;s property tax rebate program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the fiscal 2012 budget year came around, New Jersey still had a projected structural deficit, of about $10.5 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Christie dismissed that calculation, calling it the &quot;old way of budgeting.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a 2011 budget speech, Christie said the projected deficit &quot;assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday&rsquo;s New Jersey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe next year Christie said, &quot;the baseline is zero&quot; for budgeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s one way of making an $11 billion deficit &lsquo;disappear.&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said in his State of the State address that New Jersey in fiscal budget year 2011 faced a projected $11 billion budget. The governor also said that he, with the Legislature&rsquo;s help, was able to balance the budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie used to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting. Now, &quot;the baseline is zero&quot; for budgeting, the governor has said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s important context Christie&rsquo;s statement lacks. As it did in previous fact-checks, this statement rates Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/01/politifact_nj_chris_christie_s.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-08T18:29:51.016956", "ruling_date": "2013-01-09T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie says New Jersey faced an $11 billion deficit in fiscal year 2011", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-says-new-jersey-faced-11-billion-de", "ruling_link_text": "Four times doesn't make it True", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tState of the State address by Gov.
