What&rsquo;s key here is that the Facebook post misses the critical distinction between inactive voters and fraudulent votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judicial Watch argues that retaining inactive voters on the rolls poses a voting fraud risk. The group does not claim more than a million fraudulent votes were cast in California, as this Facebook post states.
