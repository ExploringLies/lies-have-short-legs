He referred us instead to studies on his website, most of which deal with effects of methyl mercury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is a very different chemical from ethyl mercury, a component in the vaccine preservative thimerosal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that difference in a minute. But the story of thimerosal and vaccine safety bears repeating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early vaccinations carried the risk of dangerous and sometimes lethal bacterial infections, such as a staph infection that killed four children in 1916. Thimerosal was added to vaccines to keep multi-dose vials free from such bacteria starting in the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998, the British medical journal the <em>Lancet</em> published a paper that claimed there was a link between the MMR vaccine &mdash; for measles, mumps and rubella &mdash; and autism. The paper by Dr. Andrew Wakefield drew considerable publicity and is credited in pushing vaccination rates down in the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration held meetings to discuss the idea that thimerosal &mdash; then used in three childhood vaccines such as the hepatitis B shot &mdash; was damaging immunized infants&rsquo; brains and contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Dr. Neal Halsey was the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. The Johns Hopkins pediatrician had long pushed for expanding vaccinations as a way for children to live healthier lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he was willing to entertain the idea that thimerosal was helping to impair infant brains, even though there were no data to support the theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thimerosal was removed and has not been used as a preservative in any vaccine on the recommended schedule for children since 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2004, Wakefield&#39;s study was retracted and would later be deemed an &quot;elaborate fraud&quot; by the British medical journal <em>BMJ</em>. Wakefield eventually lost his medical license over the ordeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, several studies, including ones in 2001 and 2004 from the Institute of Medicine, found no evidence linking vaccines and autism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was no convincing evidence that there was any harm from thimerosal, but I felt we would have difficulties with public acceptance of vaccines if we continued its use,&quot; Halsey said. &quot;We are not using it anymore. Now the science is definitive that the small amount of thimerosal did not cause autism or any other neurological damage. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The damage may already have been done, though, regarding public suspicion of vaccines. Like Halsey, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia, agreed that the science never supported the theory that thimerosal caused harm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Offit worried attention to the unproven fear of &quot;mercury&quot; was minimizing the proven fear of the diseases the vaccines were designed to keep at bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Before there were vaccines, whooping cough killed 8,000 children a year, polio crippled 20,000 kids and killed 1,500 to 2,000,&quot; Offit said. &quot;Measles killed 500 children a year and caused 48,000 to be hospitalized. The best way to address safety concerns is not to cater to false ones and focus on those real threats.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adams also confuses the issue with the interchangeable use of the term &quot;mercury&quot; for both thimerosal&rsquo;s ethyl mercury and the more problematic methyl mercury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of ethyl mercury like ethyl alcohol &mdash; easily expelled from the human body but dangerous in large quantities. Thimerosal was used in trace amounts in vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Methyl mercury is the compound found in fish and water, which builds up because the body can&rsquo;t easily expel it. While some amounts occur naturally in the environment, it&rsquo;s more comparable to methyl alcohol, the methanol that fills your gas tank but isn&rsquo;t fit for human consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repeated research studies agree that there is no evidence of harm from thimerosal&rsquo;s mercury compound in vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is an even bigger problem with Adams&rsquo; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aware of the controversy and confusion, lists all ingredients in childhood vaccines for review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MMR, the vaccine making headlines now, never contained thimerosal. Neither did the shots for chickenpox, polio or others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thimerosal, remember, was designed to prevent bacterial growth with repeated entry into a vial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it wouldn&rsquo;t be used in single-use vials most common in the United States. And there is no need for a preservative with the live virus vaccines such as measles, said Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, our reader was right to be skeptical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been debate in the scientific community about removing a mercury compound from some vaccines. But the science has always been clear that there is no evidence that compound causes harm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bluntly, vaccines help, not hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you still don&rsquo;t believe that? Consider that the recipe in question &mdash; that is, the series of shots recommended for childhood immunization &mdash; does not include the ingredient singled out as the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any claims to the contrary muddy what should be a simple issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-10T15:40:08.477820", "ruling_date": "2015-02-11T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Anti-vaccine claim rooted in bad science, confusion", "ruling_headline_slug": "anti-vaccine-claim-rooted-fraud-confusion", "ruling_link_text": "Ingredient also not part of childhood vaccines", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"width:100.0%\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:99.36%\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>NaturalNews.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/042012_vaccine_facts_vaccine-damaged_children_CDC.html\"><strong>10 outrageous (but true) facts about vaccines the CDC and the vaccine industry don&#39;t want you to know,</strong></a>&quot;
