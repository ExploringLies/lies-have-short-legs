Kim was reportedly killed, although state media played a &quot;death to America&quot; speech recorded years ago, the article said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s death has not been reported widely because this coordinated attack did not happen.

The site <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/kim-jong-un-dead-north-koreans-calling-trump-an-assassin/\">posted a story on July 6</a> that said an American sniper had killed the North Korean leader &mdash; we ruled that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/20/blog-posting/its-fake-news-american-killed-north-koreas-leader-/\">Pants On Fire!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not immediately apparent why the site would post essentially the same story just a couple of weeks apart.
