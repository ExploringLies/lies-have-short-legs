Emails sent to The Grio Saturday all bounced back. An email sent to the author of the article and messages sent to Gillum&rsquo;s campaign were not immediately returned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum&rsquo;s tweet from Friday is quoted in the article, along with remarks <a href=\"https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/11/03/gillum-leaves-campaign-trail-wake-yoga-studio-shooting/1869438002/\">the Tallahassee Democrat reported</a> he made near where the shooting occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grio&rsquo;s post is similar to the Nov. 2 <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-news-andrew-gillum-suspends-campaign-20181102-story.html\">New York Daily News article</a> with the headline, &quot;Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum suspends campaign after 2 dead in Tallahassee shooting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guardian wrote in its Nov. 3 article that Gillum &quot;tweeted that he was leaving the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee.&quot; However, there&rsquo;s no evidence that Gillum is &quot;indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor&quot; following Friday&rsquo;s shooting like The Grio&rsquo;s post claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Gillum <a href=\"http://nd Gillum just tweeted this if we wanted to add it in: https://twitter.com/AndrewGillum/status/1058854335180914689\">is still campaigning</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, Palm Beach Post political reporter George Bennett tweeted photos of Gillum at a Jimmy Buffett concert being held to garner support for Gillum and Sen.

The concert in West Palm Beach was being held &quot;to rally voters before Election Day on Tuesday,&quot; according to a Nov. 1 <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article220946485.html\">Miami Herald article</a> announcing the concert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bennett <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gbennettpost/status/1058809089420070919\">tweeted pictures</a> of Gillum with Norman Lear and Nelson, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gbennettpost/status/1058807290961297409\">noting that both Gillum and Nelson</a> &quot;went with the khaki/blue shirt combo&quot; for the rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum also retweeted Bay News 9 and News 13 Florida capitol reporter Troy Kinsey&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TroyKinsey/status/1058807468090896385\">Nov. 3 tweet</a> that showed Gillum onstage speaking to the crowd in West Palm Beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the Orlando Sentinel <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-andrew-gillum-rally-ucf-common-20181102-story.html\">reported Nov. 2</a> that Gillum was scheduled to join other politicians and celebrities at the University of Central Florida to rally students Saturday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In campaign press releases sent Saturday, Gillum&rsquo;s campaign said campaign events would be taking place throughout the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On Saturday, November 3, the Gillum for Governor &lsquo;Bring It Home&rsquo; bus tour will continue with stops across South and Central Florida. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam will campaign for Mayor Gillum in Lake Worth, followed by a &quot;Get Out the Vote&quot; event at UCF and concluding the day at a Jimmy Buffett GOTV concert in West Palm Beach,&quot; a campaign email sent at 12:06 a.m. on Nov. 3 said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>According to the email, Gillum was scheduled to speak in both Orlando and West Palm Beach Saturday.
