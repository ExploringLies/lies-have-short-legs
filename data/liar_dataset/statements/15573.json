Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who first made headlines on June 23, 2018, when she <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jun/26/have-us-rep-maxine-waters-and-president-donald-tru/\">told</a> protestors at a Los Angeles rally to put pressure on the Trump administration over its policy separating immigrant families at the border with Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waters has been under constant fire from conservatives &mdash; including Trump, who elevated her profile with a series of Twitter attacks &mdash; for her comments at the rally. Waters also has become a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/17/blog-posting/no-maxine-waters-comment-anderson-cooper-meme-made/\">target</a> of several false reports and internet memes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest example: A doctored image purporting to show her telling CNN that an &quot;illegal immigrant&quot; should be nominated as the next Supreme Court justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Waters: SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant,&quot; said the chyron in what appeared to be a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RealTrumpNation/photos/a.744441295687017.1073741829.735823829882097/1283240148473793/?type=3&amp;theater\">screenshot</a> of a CNN interview with Waters. The photo was posted to Facebook on June 28, 2018, by <a href=\"https://www.trumpnation.com/\">Trump Nation</a>, a group devoted to supporting the president. On a ticker at the bottom of the image, Waters is quoted as saying, &quot;It&rsquo;s the only way the Democrats can ever win again.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a comment accompanying the image, the post said: &quot;... and this is why WE don&#39;t watch CNN... They are bat shit crazy!

She makes no mention of a judicial nominee being an immigrant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports indicating that the doctored image was real.
