The Republican nominee assured voters he didn&rsquo;t back full-fledged toll roads that require all motorists to pay. Rather, he was open to adding a faster-moving lane to freeways that drivers would pay a toll to use. That is, toll lanes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t support tolls,&quot; Walker said in an Oct. 23, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/105580798.html\">article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>. &quot;Tolls are where you have no options (on paying). I oppose tolls today just as much as I did in 2004.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2004, Walker was running for re-election as Milwaukee County executive. He promised not only to block any toll ways but also any new fees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll of which means it&rsquo;s time to break out the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/aug/05/introducing-flip-o-meter/\">Flip-O-Meter</a>, which we use to determine whether someone has flip-flopped on an issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s support for toll lanes drew at least two accusations of flip-flopping in the days before the Nov. 2 election. <a href=\"http://www.barrettforwisconsin.com/blog/item/2010-10-say-no-to-scott-walkers-toll-tax-\">One</a> came from Democratic challenger Tom Barrett, who created a website called <a href=\"http://www.notolltax.com/\">www.notolltax.com</a>.

Jim Doyle would be open to charging tolls on state highways, possibly for express lanes. Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/39787612.html\">said</a> he was generally opposed to tolls, but that the concept of a so-called HOT lane was worth discussing. High-occupancy toll lanes give motorists the option of paying a toll to use a less congested lane. In some places, drivers who have one or more passengers can use the HOT lanes without paying.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo: Opposed to toll roads, but open to toll lanes, which would create a new fee for those who want to use them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Aug. 6, 2010: </strong>In a debate, Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/100134304.html\">repeated</a> his opposition to toll roads. But in an interview, he said he was open to allowing drivers to pay to use express lanes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, opposed to toll roads, but open to toll lanes and the fees that go with them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Oct. 19, 2010:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/105268363.html\">Walker </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/105268363.html\">told</a> the <a href=\"http://www.tdawisconsin.org/about.iml\">Transportation Development Association of </a><a href=\"http://www.tdawisconsin.org/about.iml\">Wisconsin</a> he supports putting tolls on new highway express lanes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was the move that prompted news stories and the flip-flop cries from opponents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, where has this historical drive taken us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker has consistently opposed traditional toll roads, but as toll lanes emerged as an option, he embraced them in concept and finally endorsed them. In arguing he has not flipped on the issue, Walker actually provides some additional evidence he has at least twisted a bit: His 2004 promises list included a pledge not to create any new fees, but his support for toll lanes amounts to a user fee to drivers who want to use the faster lane.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn our estimation, with his position on tolls, Walker has done a Half-Flip.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-05T19:37:47.672968", "ruling_date": "2010-11-09T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker has shifted tone on highway tolls ", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-has-shifted-tone-highway-tolls", "ruling_link_text": "Walker hasn't changed lanes entirely, but latest statement is a shift", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarrett for governor campaign <a href=\"http://www.barrettforwisconsin.com/blog/item/2010-10-say-no-to-scott-walkers-toll-tax-\">news release</a>, Oct. 25, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreater Wisconsin Committee website, <a href=\"http://www.greaterwisconsin.org/aboutus.htm\">About </a><a href=\"http://www.greaterwisconsin.org/aboutus.htm\">us</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greaterwisconsin.org/issues.htm\">Issues</a> pages<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreater Wisconsin Political Fund, <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/101027GWPF_stuck_ad.mp3\">&quot;Stuck&quot; radio </a><a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/101027GWPF_stuck_ad.mp3\">ad</a> and <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=216228\">news release</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nBofAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y44EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4568%2C6501283\">Seeking road funds, state plans toll study</a>, Aug. 19, 2003<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/39787612.html\">Doyle open to toll roads</a>, Feb. 19, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/100134304.html\">Debate reveals few differences</a>, Aug. 7, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/43833752.html\">It&rsquo;s official: Walker in race for governor</a>, April 28, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/105268363.html\">$1.36 billion in road projects backed</a>, Oct. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/105580798.html\">Walker backs creation of toll lanes</a>, Oct. 23, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker for county executive campaign <a href=\"http://gallery.mailchimp.com/908ae464fbd99171abdc5f429/images/walker_2004_lit_2.jpg\">flier</a>, 2004 campaign</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tOn toll roads.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on toll roads as an option for state highways", "statement_date": "2010-10-19", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
