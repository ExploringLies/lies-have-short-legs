The story is the same as one on <a href=\"https://archive.is/hlL7D#selection-575.0-575.67\">yournewswire.com</a> and was previously debunked by <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/julia-roberts-say-michelle-obama-isnt-fit-clean-melania-trumps-toilet/\">Snopes</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These articles are fake news and appear to be a riff on a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/12/12/trump-lows-ever-hit-rock-bottom-editorials-debates/945947001/\"><em>USA Today </em>editorial</a> that criticized Trump after his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/940567812053053441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fopinion%2F2017%2F12%2F12%2Ftrump-lows-ever-hit-rock-bottom-editorials-debates%2F945947001%2F\">tweet</a> Dec. 12 calling U.S. Sen.

Bush&rsquo;s shoes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake news story about Roberts and Michelle Obama mimicked the toilet cleaning theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA Daily Portal stated that after Obama left the set of Roberts&rsquo; film, Roberts commented about the differences between America&rsquo;s most recent first ladies. The post accuses Roberts of saying Melania Trump has been &quot;looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country&quot; while &quot;doing a brilliant job,&quot; and Michelle Obama &quot;isn&rsquo;t fit to clean to clean her toilet.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statements followed a fictitious pattern, with more made-up quotes from Roberts attacking singer Celine Dion for criticizing Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence Roberts made any of those statements about the Obamas, Melania Trump or Celine Dion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Roberts has supported national Democrats in recent years including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 2016, <a href=\"http://aboutjulia.com/2016/10/video-watch-julia-roberts-speech-hillary-clinton-fundraiser/\">Roberts</a> was one of several Hollywood and Broadway stars to team up to hold a <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/449814f63fae440ba9a13d3afee4f94e\">fundraiser for Clinton</a> at the St. James Theatre in New York.
