The decision was one of the most high profile and broad based actions to come under the politically charged sequestration cuts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tEight Wisconsin airports are on the list, including Crites Field in Waukesha, which lies in the district of U.S. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Menomonee Falls).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSensenbrenner <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/sensenbrenner-faa-email.pdf\">issued a news release</a> March 22, 2013, criticizing the FAA decision, saying the &quot;contract towers&quot; save money and have fewer safety problems. He also noted that the FAA&rsquo;s budget was being cut 5 percent, but the spending for the contract towers was dropping 75 percent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSensenbrenner added: &quot;Not coincidentally, 75 percent of the towers the Obama Administration is closing are located in Republican Congressional Districts.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCritics have said the administration is playing politics with the budget cuts. But Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s claim was one of the first we&rsquo;ve seen that quantified this complaint.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAre 75 percent in GOP districts?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe asked the congressman&rsquo;s office for evidence to support his claim. That&rsquo;s when we started to feel some turbulence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;That information came from a member of the aviation subcommittee,&quot; responded Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller in an email. We asked him to be more precise about the source of the claim and the actual number.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThree days after our initial inquiry, Miller responded: &quot;We have reissued the press release noting the correction. I appreciate you pointing it out.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWait a minute.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe didn&rsquo;t offer a correction. We only asked a question.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/sensenbrenner-email2.pdf\">reissued news release</a> carried the notation &quot;updated,&quot; and this information: &quot;(A statistic in the previous release was unverifiable).&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMiller elaborated in an email: &quot;We received (the statistic) from the office of a member on the Aviation subcommittee and are unwilling to throw anyone under the bus. We couldn&rsquo;t verify the statistic we received and therefore issued a retraction. Unfortunately, Rep. Sensenbrenner is unavailable for an interview today.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tStill curious on the number, we started searching, emailing and mapping.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSensenbrenner&rsquo;s claim was repeated in several news accounts of his reaction to the budget cuts, including on <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/22/faa-to-close-14-air-traffic-towers-citing-sequester/\">Fox News</a> and in the Janesville Gazette. (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/faa-to-close-149-air-traffic-control-towers-beginning-april-7-p79939c-199594641.html\">coverage</a> did not include the claim.)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe did come across a similar claim from another House member, U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Penn.).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;Two out of every three towers slated for closure are in Republican Congressional districts,&quot; Pitts said in a March 7, 2013 news release. &quot;Unfortunately, this political game has real implications for public safety.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe statement by Pitts, who is not a member of the aviation subcommittee, came before the FAA announced its final tower closing list. At the time, there was a preliminary list of 189 airports.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPitts, whose district includes one of the airports, did some analysis of that preliminary list, said spokesman Andrew Wimer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;We had some of our interns here look up some of the ZIP codes,&quot; of the affected towers and then cross referenced that information with congressional districts, Wimer said. The result: Just under 66 percent were in Republican districts, Wimer said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWimer declined to release the data, and he would not say what the survey results say about the final closing list.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo we&rsquo;re on our own to test Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s claim. We <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/usandworld/interactive-map-us-air-traffic-control-towers-to-close-under-sequester-201149471.html\">plotted the 149 towers</a> set for closure on a map. And then we cross referenced by party with congressional districts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOf the 149 airports slated for closure, four fall inside two separate congressional districts. Of those four, two sit in two Republican districts while the other two straddle a Republican and a Democratic district.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\r\n\tEighty-four (58 percent) of the remaining airports fall squarely inside Republican districts while 61 (42 percent) are in Democratic districts.</div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe overall breakdown of the House is 234 Republicans to 201 Democrats, which means Republicans have about 54 percent of the seats.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThere is another factor at play: Many of the affected airports are in less-populated rural areas that tend to lean Republican.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s land this item.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tArguing politics were involved in the FAA&rsquo;s tower closing decision, Sensenbrenner said 75 percent of the towers set to close were in Republican districts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThree days after we asked about it, Sensenbrenner removed the claim and, in at least in one version of the statement, included a note saying a previous version relied on &quot;unverifiable&quot; information. It would have been more accurate to say that the statement was unverified.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe verified the numbers.
