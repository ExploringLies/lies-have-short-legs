He said <a href=\"http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/buffalo-trempealeau-counties-recovering-after-flash-flood-sweeps-across-region/article_172ba25b-5644-59d7-b266-1be3b45d53d8.html\">flooding caused</a> by an August 2016 storm damaged the 125-foot Schoepps Valley Bridge, which spans Waumandee Creek, beyond repair. &quot;It&rsquo;s scrap,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic, so in that sense it could be considered &quot;condemned,&quot; Platteter told us -- but it was judged safe for pedestrian crossing, which continued until demolition began nearly seven months later, in March 2017. Nearby residents would drive their children to the bridge and the kids walked over it to catch the school bus, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to avoid a detour of up to 20 miles, some residents with multiple vehicles parked one on the road on one side of the bridge and one on the other side. Platteter said a new timber bridge is expected to be installed by the end of April 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Highway U bridge in Buffalo County partially <a href=\"http://www.leadertelegram.com/News/Front-Page/2017/02/22/Buffalo-County-bridge-partially-collapses.html\">collapsed</a> one evening in February 2017, causing accidents two accidents that injured both drivers, though neither needed treatment.&nbsp;The collapse likely was also because of flood damage, Platterer said. That bridge is also now open only to pedestrians. But school buses use other county roads to pick up and drop off children in that area, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vinehout says Wisconsin children are crossing &quot;condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two bridges in Vinehout&rsquo;s home county of Buffalo have been &quot;condemned&quot; in that they are too badly damaged for any vehicle traffic. But officials have determined that they remain safe for pedestrians, and children do use one of the bridges to get to and from their school bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.</p> div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-01T16:56:46.580367", "ruling_date": "2017-03-03T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Are kids in rural Wisconsin crossing 'condemned' bridges to catch their school bus?
