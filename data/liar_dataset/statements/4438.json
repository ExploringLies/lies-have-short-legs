Are those things you would support?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>RICK PERRY:</strong> &quot;And he&#39;s going to pay for them all with raising your taxes. That is the issue. He had $800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus. It created zero jobs, $400-plus billion dollars in this package. And I can do the math on that one. Half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact has regularly checked job claims about the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, so this one caught our ears.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tZero?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRepublican Sen.
