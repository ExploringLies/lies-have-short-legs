This prompted many pats on the back from the county. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the <a href=\"http://www.clackamas.us/pressreleases/pr20120823b.html\">first sentence from the county media release </a>sent out to press: &quot;Clackamas County Commissioners on Wednesday approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the county&rsquo;s contribution to TriMet&rsquo;s Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million and approved the sale of bonds to pay the obligation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe three commissioners who voted in favor put out statements congratulating their financial savvy. The re-election campaign of commission <a href=\"http://www.clackamas.us/bcc/lehan/\">Chair Charlotte Lehan </a>issued a press release that stated that &quot;the new terms are expected to save Clackamas County taxpayers at least $6.6 million in general fund obligations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.clackamas.us/bcc/damon/\">Commissioner Jamie Damon</a>, also up for re-election in November, issued a campaign release that stated that the settlement would &quot;save over $5 million -- a reduction of over 20 percent from the original $25 million project.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.clackamas.us/bcc/lininger/\">Commissioner Ann Lininger</a>, who is retiring, submitted a guest column to The Oregonian in which she said the county approved a $19.9 million financing plan and settlement terms to fulfill its obligations to TriMet. She also said the agreement enables the county &quot;to avoid a late-payment penalty of as much as $1.25 million.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCool, right? Taxpayers love saving money. And commissioners probably think this is a good way to placate residents who are on the fence about a MAX line between Portland and Milwaukie. The agreement comes before a Sept. 18 election on a county ballot measure, which, if approved, would require voter approval before officials can spend money on light rail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead of singling out a commissioner, we will focus on the statement put out by the county since it sums up nicely the numbers on which the three-member majority wants to focus: $19.9 million versus $25 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new agreement with <a href=\"http://www.clackamas.us/pga/documents/termsheet.pdf\">TriMet does slice $2.4 million from the $25 million</a>. But that leaves a balance of $22.6 million, not $19.9 million. The county also agrees to other actions that are in-lieu of cash payment:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDonate a parcel of land with a real market value of $20,915.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPay for road and signal improvements worth $1,279,740.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWaive the county&rsquo;s engineering fees, valued at $1,365,307.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe total value of the listed in-kind contributions comes to $2,665,962 -- resources that could be used for other county services if they weren&rsquo;t going toward light rail. Subtracting those contributions leaves a cash balance of $19,934,038 the county owes TriMet. In other words, $19.9 million. (The county is<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/index.ssf/2012/08/clackamas_county_schedules_191.html\">set</a><a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/index.ssf/2012/08/clackamas_county_schedules_191.html\"> to sell $19.1 million in bonds Sept. 6</a>, toward the balance due.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Oregonian&rsquo;s Clackamas County reporter has consistently characterized the cost of the new agreement with TriMet as $22.6 million, even if the new amount that requires financing is lower. &nbsp;We think that&rsquo;s more accurate, despite politicians&rsquo; inclinations to inflate. So does Dan Chandler, strategic policy administrator and the county&rsquo;s point man on the subject.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The reduction in borrowing is $5 million, but the actual savings are less than that,&quot; Chandler said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe original agreement signed in February 2010 called for Clackamas County to pay TriMet $25 million toward the cost of the $1.5 billion project. Section 4.1 of the contract states the county could meet that amount by lump-sum payment or payments or in-kind contributions, or any combination.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s return to the statement: Did the commission approve a new deal that lowers the county&rsquo;s contribution to $19.9 million, down from $25 million? It did not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe county&rsquo;s financial contribution to TriMet for the new Orange line is now $22.6 million, much of which will be financed by borrowing. The in-kind contributions come from money the county will now forgo or must spend to meet its obligations. Those are real dollars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find the statement to be False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-30T20:38:18.261523", "ruling_date": "2012-08-30T17:36:16", "ruling_headline": "Did Clackamas County negotiate a $19.9 million TriMet deal, down from $25 million?
