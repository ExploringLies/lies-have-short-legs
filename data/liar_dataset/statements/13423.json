They never show crowds. They don&#39;t show crowds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if the media really never showed Trump crowds, so we turned to the archives and a former CBS photojournalist to figure it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The coverage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most rally coverage shown on television focuses on the candidate speaking behind the podium, rather than showing the whole crowd. There&rsquo;s a reason for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At campaign events, one television network organization is responsible for controlling the head-on pool camera, and other cameras are responsible for wide shots and reaction&nbsp;shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Les Rose, a professor at Syracuse and former field producer and photojournalist for CBS, said whoever is working the head-on pool camera&nbsp;is not working for the employer, but working for every television network or station in America.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, local news stations and national stations bring their own camera equipment to cover the event, but&nbsp;media outlets are dependent on the footage that is shot on these head-on pool cameras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cameraperson in charge of the head-on pool camera has a very specific goal: get a shot of the candidate walking onto the stage, a shot of the candidate walking off the stage and the candidate saying the speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If (Trump&rsquo;s) looking strictly at that feed (from the head-on camera), then you&rsquo;re never going to see a crowd because that&rsquo;s not the gig,&quot; Rose said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason news outlets often show the head-on pool footage is because the audio is the most clear in comparison to the other camera responsible for the reaction shots. Rose said the other cameras pick up natural sounds like applause that can make it harder to hear the actual speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, this doesn&rsquo;t mean the media doesn&rsquo;t show crowds at Trump rallies. A quick Google search quickly debunked this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reporters have shown Trump&rsquo;s crowds through photos. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>See examples <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-speech-2015-11\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-crowd-size_us_55a56d2de4b04740a3de3d26\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/alleyes/donald-trump-in-tampa-as-seen-through-the-lens-of-loren-elliott/2265533\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/local/photos-trump-rally-west-palm-beach/Ip01CDShlHT6CWmHpyVmuM/#41\">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/picture-gallery/news/politics/elections/2016/10/17/photos-trump-rallies-in-green-bay-as-election-approaches/92313614/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>News stories:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZzC-IzwZuKC_rz4JfSHzHAxFTuAWcBn-FJEeyqeyoip3x2oIh04Z2MFNqZyZGHSYEbmCXetUmYE4FjasRDBl728cHYeAEPKEf4yqdforzEkEnuKaToz2_3zmfQH8gmHSrROBpOeG\" style=\"border:none; height:259px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;More than 15,000 fired-up Donald Trump fans turned out Monday night to cheer on the presidential nominee heading into the final two weeks of the campaign,&quot; reads the lede of a <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/donald-trump-rallies-thousands-in-tampa-implores-them-to-vote/2299972\">story from the<em> Tampa Bay Times</em></a> from his Oct. 24 rally in Tampa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;His supporters routinely pointed, as the nominee did, to the huge crowds still flocking to see him as evidence that his campaign remains strong,&quot; reads a line from a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/donald-trump-voters.html\"><em>New York Times</em> article</a> from Trump&rsquo;s rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/29/yes-donald-trumps-crowds-are-big-but-not-quite-as-yuge-as-he-often-claims/\">The <em>Washington Post</em></a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/29/yes-donald-trumps-crowds-are-big-but-not-quite-as-yuge-as-he-often-claims/\"> even wrote a story</a> about Trump&rsquo;s crowds that looked into the actual size of crowds at Trump rallies.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&quot;Ever since Trump launched his presidential campaign in June 2015, he has attracted massive crowds to rallies across the country,&quot;&nbsp;reads the article.&nbsp;&quot;During the primaries, Trump&rsquo;s head counts were nearly always larger than those of his Republican rivals or Clinton&rsquo;s, whose audiences back then usually topped out at 1,000.
