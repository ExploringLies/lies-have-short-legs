President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated Kennedy in November 1987, a year ahead of the election, to replace Louis Powell, who retired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations,&nbsp;though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas&rsquo; place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also note that in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a &quot;recess appointment&quot; to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore said &quot;six justices&quot; on the U.S. Supreme Court have been &quot;confirmed in presidential election years since 1912.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rating is True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-16T13:13:43.515095", "ruling_date": "2016-03-17T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Urging vote on Merrick Garland, congresswoman says 6 justices have been OK'd in presidential years", "ruling_headline_slug": "urging-vote-merrick-garland-congresswoman-says-6-j", "ruling_link_text": "Precedent six times over", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Twitter, U.S. Rep.
