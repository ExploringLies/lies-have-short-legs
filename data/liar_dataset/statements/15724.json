He also implemented changes to how water management districts are funded that affect their finances in the long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Counting up the cuts </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We began by reaching out to the Florida Democratic Party about its evidence for the claim. A party spokesperson sent us a 2018 Miami Herald <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/fabiola-santiago/article215944365.html\">column</a> by Fabiola Santiago blaming Scott for dirty beaches, as well as a Palm Beach Post <a href=\"https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state--regional/after-700m-water-district-cuts-florida-governor-wants-more/oVyIo2oEan9LaenPiDdgnM/amp.html\">news article</a> from 2011, near the end of Scott&rsquo;s first year in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That Palm Beach Post story begins with the line, &quot;The state&#39;s five water management districts have slashed their budgets by more than $700 million -- about 40 percent -- but Gov. Rick Scott, who initiated the cuts, wants a little more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s five districts have a <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/water-policy/water-policy/content/water-management-districts\">variety of responsibilities</a>, from water supply and quality management to flood and natural systems management. All five districts release their budgets on their websites annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The districts release data for each financial year, which runs from Oct. 1 of the previous year to Sept. 30 of the named year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first budgets that Scott had a say in came in the 2012 fiscal year, from Oct. 1, 2011, to Sept. 30, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 2011 to 2012 fiscal years, the budgets of all five districts were cut across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South Florida district suffered the most in cuts. Its <a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2011_budget_brief.pdf\">FY 2011 budget</a> was $1.07 billion while its <a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2012_budget_brief.pdf\">FY 2012 budget</a> was $576.1 million. That&rsquo;s a reduction of $493.9 million, or 49 percent. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the Southwest Florida district&rsquo;s budget was slashed by $124.3 million in FY 2012. Combined with the $13.9 million, $35 million, and $14 million cuts to the budgets of the Suwannee River district, St. Johns River district, and Northwest Florida district, respectively, those numbers add up to just over the $700 million. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, since 2012, the overall budget of the five districts has risen by almost $300 million. So the difference between pre-Scott cut budgets and the current budgets is now not $700 million, but rather closer to $400 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Whose responsibility is it, anyway?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Scott&rsquo;s press secretary for comment. Lauren Schenone told PolitiFact, &quot;Water management districts independently create their own budgets. Their budgetary decisions, including tax and revenue collection, are ultimately made by the board of each water management district &mdash; not the governor, so they are completely wrong on this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Districts do begin the budget process themselves&nbsp;by creating a preliminary budget independently of the governor. But their budgets pass&nbsp;through a complex <a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/Water%20Management%20District%20Budget%20Timeline.pdf\">adoption process</a>. They need&nbsp;to eventually be approved by <a href=\"https://www.nwfwater.com/Business-Finance/District-Budget\">many groups</a>, including the Florida Senate president, the Florida House speaker, and each water management district&rsquo;s governing board, whose members are <a href=\"https://www.sjrwmd.com/governingboard/\">appointed by the governor</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0300-0399/0373/Sections/0373.536.html\">section 373.536(5)(a)</a> of the Florida Statutes, the governor has the final say &quot;to approve or disapprove water management district budgets in whole or in part.&quot; So if the governor doesn&rsquo;t like a specific item in a district&rsquo;s budget, he or she can veto it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott has claimed responsibility for the water management district budget cuts in the past, such as in this <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2011/08/26/governor-rick-scott%E2%80%99s-weekly-radio-address-8262011/\">radio address</a> from August 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I took action on the proposed budgets of Florida&rsquo;s five water management districts,&quot; Scott said. &quot;All together, these budgets reflect a reduction of more than $700&nbsp;million&nbsp;over last year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott also restricted how much revenue districts could collect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large part of district budgets comes from revenue collected through property taxes. In 2011, Scott signed a bill into <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=s2142z.APC.DOCX&amp;DocumentType=Analysis&amp;BillNumber=2142&amp;Session=2011\">law</a> that placed a limit on the maximum amount of property tax the districts could levy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That bill lowered district property tax revenues by 30 percent, or $210 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Those (property tax) revenues have not been restored to their pre-Gov. Scott levels,&quot; said Aliki Moncrief, executive director of Florida Conservation Voters. &quot;Assuming the taxable value of Florida property stayed the same from 2011-2019, we are talking about at least $1.7 billion in lost revenue for water management districts (over the course of eight years).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott took responsibility for those revenue cuts, too. In a June 2011 <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/210-5-million-tax-cut-governor-scott-signs-property-tax-relief-bill-2/\">press release</a>, he said, &quot;This property tax cut allows families and businesses to use more of their hard-earned money in the way they see best, rather than having to send it to a government agency.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Democratic Party tweeted that Scott &quot;cut $700 million from water management.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The budgets of Florida&rsquo;s five water management districts were collectively cut by over $700 million about a year into Scott&rsquo;s first term. Since the governor has the final say over the water management districts&rsquo; budgets, the tweet is largely accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the years since 2012, the districts&rsquo; budgets have started to rise again. The overall budget of the five districts is no longer $700 million less than the pre-Scott budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-13T14:26:13.209432", "ruling_date": "2018-08-14T10:11:04", "ruling_headline": "Yes, Rick Scott did cut $700 million from Florida\u2019s water management districts", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-rick-scott-did-cut-700-million-floridas-water-", "ruling_link_text": "Statement holds up swimmingly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FlaDems/status/1026234065865719808\">Tweet</a> from Florida Democrats, August 5, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Caroline Rowland, Communications Director, Florida Democratic Party, August 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Lauren Schenone, Press Secretary, Rick Scott for Florida, August 6, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange and phone interview with Jonathan Webber and Aliki Moncrief, Florida Conservation Voters, August 7 and 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Frank Jackalone, Diana Umpierre, and Dave Cullen, Sierra Club in Florida, August 7, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Katelyn Potter, Communications Director, Suwannee River Water Management District, August 8-9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Sandy Bertram, District Clerk, St. Johns River Water Management District, August 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Jim Lamar, Director of Communications, Northwest Florida Water Management District, August 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Brett Cyphers, Executive Director, Northwest Florida Water Management District, August 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2018 Florida Statutes, <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0300-0399/0373/Sections/0373.536.html\">Section 373.536: District budget and hearing thereon</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governor Rick Scott, <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/2011/08/26/governor-rick-scott%E2%80%99s-weekly-radio-address-8262011/\">Weekly Radio Address</a>, August 26, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Northwest Florida Water Management District, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nwfwater.com/Business-Finance/District-Budget\">District Budget</a>,&quot; accessed August 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suwannee River Water Management District, &quot;<a href=\"http://mysuwanneeriver.com/DocumentCenter/Index/24\">Document Center</a>,&quot; accessed August 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St. Johns River Water Management District, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.sjrwmd.com/documents/financial/#statements\">Financial statements</a>,&quot; accessed August 8, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Florida Water Management District, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2011_budget_brief.pdf\">Budget in brief FY2010-11</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South Florida Water Management District, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.sfwmd.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2012_budget_brief.pdf\">Budget in brief FY2011-12</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Southwest Florida Water Management District, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/about/newsroom/news/district-approves-millage-rate-and-budget\">District Approves Millage Rate and Budget</a>,&quot; September 27, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Department of Environmental Protection, &quot;<a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/water-policy/water-policy/content/water-management-districts\">Water Management Districts</a>,&quot; August 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Department of Environmental Protection, &quot;<a href=\"https://floridadep.gov/water-policy/water-policy/content/water-management-district-budgets\">Water Management District Budgets</a>,&quot; August 30, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miami Herald, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/fabiola-santiago/article215944365.html\">Red tide and green water?
