Rob Portman features a video clip of his opponent, former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, saying, &quot;My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that,&quot; before the ad launches&nbsp;into attacks on his economic record. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The narrator says that Strickland is speaking &quot;on his record,&quot; then slams Strickland for 350,000 jobs lost and $8 million in taxes raised. PolitiFact Ohio has checked <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/aug/03/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-ohio-lost-40/\">those </a>two <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/oct/13/john-kasich/gop-challengers-labels-ohio-gov-ted-stricklands-ta/\">figures </a>before and rated the claims Half True and Mostly True, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&rsquo;d like to know where Fighting for Ohio got that &quot;mixed and spotty&quot; clip. Did the former Ohio governor really fall on his sword over the economic upshot of his tenure?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, he didn&rsquo;t. The ad takes Strickland&rsquo;s words&nbsp;out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text under the video cites a <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer </em>editorial board&rsquo;s February interview of Democratic primary Senate candidates, which is posted in its entirety on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XGjfiaxMw\">YouTube</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The context tells the tale. At the 26:13 mark of the interview, primary hopeful P.G. Sittenfeld asked Strickland, &quot;Why should Democratic voters not judge you by your record on guns?&quot; He criticized Strickland for reversing his anti-gun control stance, a change of heart Strickland&rsquo;s aides have <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/12/21/strickland-switches-on-gun-rights.html\">attributed </a>to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., that resulted in the deaths of 20 children and six adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland countered that he welcomed voters to judge him by his record, then changed the subject to the diversity of his cabinet appointees during his term as Ohio&rsquo;s governor from 2007 to 2011. But the topic snapped back to guns (at the 28-minute mark) when one of the off-camera <em>Plain Dealer</em> interviewers asked&nbsp;Strickland to clarify his stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Has my position changed over time? It has,&quot; Strickland answered. &quot;Can people criticize me for that? Absolutely. You&rsquo;re not going to find me out there saying my records with guns is not a legitimate -- you know, it&rsquo;s one of many issues that people will look at and make a decision about me and this race, and so on and so forth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, Strickland tried&nbsp;to explain his gun&nbsp;rights position, calling President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s 1994 crime bill, which he voted against in Congress, &quot;one of the worst pieces of legislation that&rsquo;s been passed in decades.&quot; He said he dropped his NRA membership &quot;five or six years ago,&quot; and defended a recent radio interview in which he boasted about his A+&nbsp;rating from the NRA in 2010. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s monologue concluded at the 31:40 minute mark, when he said, &quot;My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next 12 minutes of discussion is fixed on the candidates&rsquo; stances on gun control. Not employment, not taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steiner Public Relations in Columbus, Ohio, is fielding questions for Fighting for Ohio. Their spokesperson, Jen Detwiler, said, &quot;We&rsquo;ll let the content of the ad stand on its own.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An attack ad juxtaposes employment figures and tax dollars with a video clip of Strickland saying, &quot;My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s stance on gun control may have wavered, but the context in which he made the &quot;mixed and spotty&quot; statement did not. Strickland was talking about guns, not jobs or taxes. The Fighting for Ohio PAC&rsquo;s &quot;Spotty&quot; ad distorts the context of his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this ad False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/02d12e26-ad74-49e5-9fff-f0ca114a71eb\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/02d12e26-ad74-49e5-9fff-f0ca114a71eb</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-13T10:13:10.196222", "ruling_date": "2016-05-13T15:10:35", "ruling_headline": "Fighting for Ohio PAC ad takes Ted Strickland\u2019s 'mixed and spotty' quote out of context", "ruling_headline_slug": "fighting-ohio-pac-ad-takes-ted-stricklands-mixed-a", "ruling_link_text": "Let's go to the tape", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Jen Detwiler, Steiner Public Relations, May 10-11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, David Bergstein, Ted Strickland for Senate, May 11-12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, &quot;Strickland switches on gun rights,&quot; <em>Columbus Dispatch</em>, <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/12/21/strickland-switches-on-gun-rights.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Dec. 21, 2015</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article, &quot;PAC backing Portland runs attack ad,&quot; <em>Toledo Blade</em>, <a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2016/05/10/PAC-backing-Portman-runs-attack-ad.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&nbsp;May 10, 2016</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TV ad, &quot;Spotty,&quot; <u><a href=\"http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_tedstrickland_kq07a/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">PoliticalAdArchive.org</a></u></p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Fighting for Ohio ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 3510, "last_name": "PAC", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "fighting-ohio-pac", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Fighting_for_Ohio_PAC.PNG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GOP.PNG", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3510/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.fightingforohio.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Ted Strickland admits his record on jobs and taxes is &quot;mixed and spotty.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Fighting for Ohio PAC ad", "statement_date": "2016-05-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 159, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/159/", "subject": "Voting Record", "subject_slug": "voting-record", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Former Ohio governor", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Ted", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 532, "last_name": "Strickland", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "ted-strickland", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifactohio-ted-strickland____.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/532/", "total_count": 21, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
