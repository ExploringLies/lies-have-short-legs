Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who illustrated&nbsp;his criticism with Trump&rsquo;s billionaire cabinet, which &quot;has more wealth than a third of the American people total -- close to a 100 million people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That seems like a large share of wealth in cabinet member&rsquo;s pockets. But is Schumer right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is, although his comparison is disputed among economists because so many Americans have a low net worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer specifically talks about the &quot;net wealth&quot; of cabinet members. &nbsp;Net wealth is how much a person&rsquo;s assets are worth once you have subtracted liabilities, like mortgage or credit card debt. If a person has high debt that exceeds their assets, their net wealth is negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is impossible to calculate the exact net wealth of Trump&rsquo;s cabinet, because the members are only required to indicate a range while filling out their financial disclosure forms, such as &quot;between $15,001 and $50,000&quot;. The ranges can vary by up to 25 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is a pretty vague indication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer&rsquo;s office cited an <a href=\"https://qz.com/862412/trumps-16-cabinet-level-picks-have-more-money-than-a-third-of-american-households-combined/\">article</a> from December by the website <a href=\"https://qz.com/862412/trumps-16-cabinet-level-picks-have-more-money-than-a-third-of-american-households-combined/\">Quartz</a> that evaluated the wealth of 17 of Trump&rsquo;s cabinet members to be more than $9.5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other news media, like the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-s-cabinet-picks-have-combined-wealth-11b-how-did-n692681\">NBC News</a> estimated it to be as high as $14.5 billion. We looked at data provided by <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/\">OpenSecrets</a> and publicly available financial disclosure forms and found a much lower number: $3.5 billion, not including assets of spouses. Due to a lack of information, we could not add Sonny Perdue, the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture, and Alexander Acosta, Trump&rsquo;s nominee for Secretary of Labor, to that number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it would not have made a big difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t really matter how rich Trump&rsquo;s cabinet members exactly are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Federal Reserve, a U.S. household had an average net wealth of $46,700 in 2013, which are the most recent numbers available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the bulk of wealth in the United States is owned by the top 10 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bottom half only holds 1 percent of U.S. wealth distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2011 the bottom quintile of Americans had a negative net wealth of -$6,029 and the second quintile had a net wealth of $7,263. This is compared to a large difference with the third quintile: $68,839 in 2011. The number keeps rising exponentially for the fourth quintile who own $205,985 and the highest quintile who owned $630,754.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bottom one-third of American households ranked by wealth own approximately nothing,&quot; says Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of Berkeley. That is because some either have a very low or even negative net wealth, due to high debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that matter, it does not take a lot to &quot;have more wealth than a third of the American people,&quot; like Schumer claimed, Zuchman added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So even if Trump&rsquo;s cabinet were all people from the middle class, Schumer&rsquo;s statement would still be accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer said that Trump&rsquo;s cabinet had more net wealth than a third of the American people. He bases his claims on an estimate of $9.5 billion of net wealth for the cabinet. Economists familiar with those kinds of comparison told us that Schumer got his numbers right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they also told us that there needs to be clarification on the meaningfulness of Schumer&rsquo;s statement, since it doesn&rsquo;t take billions of dollars to be richer than the bottom third of of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-27T13:28:13.358937", "ruling_date": "2017-03-27T15:07:02", "ruling_headline": "Does Donald Trump's cabinet collectively own more than what one-third of Americans do?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-trumps-cabinet-own-more-13-americans", "ruling_link_text": "One third owns approximately nothing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Quartz, <a href=\"https://qz.com/862412/trumps-16-cabinet-level-picks-have-more-money-than-a-third-of-american-households-combined/\">&quot;Trump&rsquo;s first 17 cabinet-level picks have more money than a third of American households combined&quot;</a>, Dec. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail, Gabriel Zucman, Economist at University of Berkeley, Mar. 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail, Dan Mitchell, Economist at Cato Institute, on Mar. 7, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-s-cabinet-picks-have-combined-wealth-11b-how-did-n692681\">&quot;Trump&rsquo;s Cabinet Picks Have a Combined Wealth of $14.5B.
