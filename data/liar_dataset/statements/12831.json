Twice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I believe the primary role of the state &nbsp;is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role,&quot; the quote reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem. The quote is a complete fabrication, and we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/mar/23/hillary-clinton-quotes-Internet-complete/\">shown this before</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March, we fact-checked the exact same image Woods tweeted. At the time, we looked at her book on Google Books and searched for the quote both on Google and on Lexis-Nexis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did not find the quote then, and we didn&rsquo;t this time after re-doing the search. The Clinton campaign declined to comment. We found quotes from the book making the opposite point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and daughters &mdash; to feed them, to sing them to sleep, to teach them to ride a bike, to encourage their talents, to help them develop spiritual lives, to make countless daily decisions that determine whom they have the potential to become,&quot; the book says on page four.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &quot;secondary&quot; does not even show up in the book, our search showed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It Takes A Village</em> has been criticized for suggesting society was responsible for parenting children, and Clinton does argue that society at large &mdash; government included &mdash; has a role in a child&rsquo;s development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But I was also blessed with caring neighbors, attentive doctors, challenging public schools, safe streets, and an economy that supported my father&rsquo;s job,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Much of my family&rsquo;s good fortune was beyond my parents&rsquo; direct control, but not beyond the control of other adults whose actions affected my life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She does not say, however, that &quot;parents have a secondary role,&quot; as Woods alleged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Kengor, a professor of political science at Grove City College and a Ronald Reagan biographer, said there is a typical divide in how conservatives and liberals (such as Clinton) view child care. He said it was conceivable Clinton would support a primary role for the state due to her liberal persuasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>William Chafe, a history professor at Duke University, disagreed. He said the book&#39;s message was to uphold a community commitment to the well-being of women and children, not to shift responsibility, calling the latter a &quot;willful misreading.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What societal role is too much is for readers to decide, but the quote is fabricated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Woods claimed that Clinton wrote that &quot;the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children.
