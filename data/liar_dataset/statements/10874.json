He added the change followed years of increasing the state&rsquo;s cash reserves from $1 billion to $10 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A state getting its bond rating upgraded is a relatively rare occurrence, so we wondered whether Florida was the only state to jump to a top rating while Bush was in office from 1999-2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Getting an upgrade &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this analysis, we&rsquo;re focusing on the state&rsquo;s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state&rsquo;s ability to pay its debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This rating, which is kind of like a person&rsquo;s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Rating Services, Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Each reports their ratings differently, but Bush&rsquo;s Right to Rise political action committee spokesman Matt Gorman told us he was referring specifically to the S&amp;P analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gorman shared a Pew Charitable Trusts infographic that showed &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2014/06/09/sp-ratings-2014\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>S&amp;P state credit ratings</u></a>&quot; from 2001 to 2014. The infographic shows that Florida was the only state between 2001 and 2006 to make the ratings leap Bush specified (AA to AAA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2005/03/01/52020.htm\">Feb. 25, 2005</a>, S&amp;P upgraded Florida&rsquo;s general obligation bond rating from AA+ (which is slightly higher than their AA rating, actually) to AAA. The difference is in rating the state&rsquo;s capacity to meet its debt obligations from &quot;very strong&quot; to &quot;extremely strong,&quot; according to agency guidelines. For the record, Moody&rsquo;s and Fitch also upgraded the state that year, but their ratings are designated differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S&amp;P&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2087209-florida-sp-ratings-direct.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report on the upgrade</u></a> said the decision was &quot;based on the state&#39;s strong and conservative financial and budget management practices, coupled with substantial budget reserves and economic trends that have been among the strongest nationally.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also cited stable state revenue, a moderate debt burden and a service-based economy that was growing faster than the national average as among other reasons for the upgrade. S&amp;P&rsquo;s analysis said Florida&rsquo;s outlook was stable due to &quot;the state&#39;s strong budget reserves and demonstrated track record of active budget management and long-term planning and forecasting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush wants to take credit for this budget management, and he could <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/what-you-dont-know-about-jeb-bushs-economic-record/2227912\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>lay some claim to the idea</u></a>. He was well-known during his tenure for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/may/26/jeb-bush/saga-jeb-bushs-one-time-alias-veto-corleone/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>regularly using the line-item veto</u></a> to discard hundreds of millions in spending on budgeted projects Bush deemed wasteful or that didn&rsquo;t follow his agenda. Taking the red pen to the Legislature&rsquo;s final budgets helped build the state&rsquo;s cash reserves from <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/03/05/jeb-bush-record-florida-governor/24473497/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$1.3 billion to $9.8 billion by 2006</u></a>, so Bush&rsquo;s numbers there are pretty accurate. The Legislature actively socked cash away in state coffers during this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, yes, Florida was the only state to make the jump looking at data between 2001 and 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s one problem: Bush became governor in 1999.&nbsp;Those two years make a big difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked S&amp;P for its <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2087210-historystateratings.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>history of state ratings</u></a> and found two instances that counter Bush&rsquo;s claim: On Feb. 22, 2000, S&amp;P upgraded Delaware from AA+ to AAA. On Sept. 27, 2000, the agency did the same for Michigan. (It was downgraded back to AA+ in 2003.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida, for the record, still enjoys the AAA rating it earned in 2005, with an outlook S&amp;P now considers stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said, &quot;Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s general obligation bond rating was upgraded by Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Rating Services in 2005. But both Delaware and Michigan were upgraded from AA+ to AAA by the S&amp;P in 2000, which was during Bush&rsquo;s second year in office. The information Bush&rsquo;s PAC cited did not include his first two years in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-27T12:39:55.537504", "ruling_date": "2015-05-28T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jeb Bush says Florida was the only state to get AAA bond rating during his tenure", "ruling_headline_slug": "jeb-bush-says-florida-was-only-state-get-aaa-bond-", "ruling_link_text": "Delaware and Michigan also scored a AAA rating", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Audio of Bush business roundtable in Portsmouth, N.H., May 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Rating Services, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2087209-florida-sp-ratings-direct.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Florida: Tax Secured, General Obligation</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 25, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Free Republic</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1351546/posts\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Wall Street upgrades Florida debt rating</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 26, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Insurance Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2005/03/01/52020.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>S&amp;P Upgrades Fla.
