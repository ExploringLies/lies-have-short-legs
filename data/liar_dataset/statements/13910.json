Facebook flagged a post with the misleading headline as part of its efforts to identify fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case the headline is misleading, but the contents of the story are not necessarily fake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spliced video clips of Morgan first circulated about four years ago, said Amber Southard, a spokeswoman for Morgan, who was<a href=\"http://www.pnj.com/story/news/2016/11/08/sheriff-david-morgan-wins-again/93422036/\"> re-elected to a third term </a>in November 2016. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nowhere in the video does he say&quot; what the headline says, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan has been in the news for controversial statements or <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-unconstitutional-conditions-confinement-escambia-county-fla-jail\">practices </a>involving African-Americans, but the claim that he did made the statement in the headline is wrong. We didn&rsquo;t hear that statement in the videos, and we searched for it in Nexis and found no evidence that Morgan said it.&nbsp;We attempted to reach someone at the website where we saw this headline and were unsuccessful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t fully evaluate Morgan&rsquo;s comments because they appear to stem from partial videos and not full speeches. However, here is a summary of what he did say in the clips with some added context from other news accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/\">PolitiFact Florida</a> examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural&nbsp;<a href=\"http://factcheckingday.com/\">International Fact-Checking Day</a>, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as &quot;not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Let me take issue with the title of African-American&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first video clip, Morgan appears to be speaking in a sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First off, let me take issue with the title of &lsquo;African-American,&rsquo;&quot; Morgan begins. &quot;We&rsquo;re Americans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan then explains that he is &quot;fourth-generation Welsh&quot; and doesn&rsquo;t refer to himself as a &quot;Welsh-American.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was not born in Wales and the blacks that currently reside in the United States of America are not from Africa,&quot; he says. &quot;Those sorts of terms that society has come to use are divisive in nature.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan then says many issues in the minority community in Escambia County are real while &quot;most of them are perceived.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan then says that not that many years ago, the thought of an African-American president would have been unthinkable but Barack Obama won election twice by getting the votes of people of various races -- not just blacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If we&rsquo;re such a racist nation, why do we currently have an African-American president?&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video shows Morgan offering his critique of the black community:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have unfortunately in the black community embraced a thug culture -- one that aggrandizes, &nbsp;again, foul language, shooting cops, abusing women and if you don&rsquo;t think those things have an effect on our children, you need to get a grip.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cites black-on-white crime incidents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the video clips appears to come from part of a speech that Morgan made at a <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/08/escambia_county_sheriff_david_morgan_his_bizarre_defense_of_the_shooting.html\">Rotary Club meeting</a> in August 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His speech followed an incident in which two white Escambia deputies shot an unarmed black man who was looking for cigarettes in his mother&rsquo;s car parked in his driveway. The deputies fired multiple rounds and two bullets struck 60-year-old Roy Middleton, shattering his leg. The deputies were responding to a burglary call. (A grand jury later found insufficient evidence to prosecute the officers but called for more intensive training for deputies.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video clip circulating on the Internet shows Morgan recounting three violent crime incidents that involved black perpetrators and white victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Last night we had four black male teenagers attack a 77-year-old white man,&quot; he said. &quot;Where is the public outrage in that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also recounted a homicide in which he said three black people beat a white woman to death and a time a black man shot an unarmed white man &quot;execution style.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan then calls for &quot;equality across the board&quot; and calls for working together with families, schools and churches to bring back &quot;character and integrity to our communities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He says that criminologists have identified the &quot;rise of the superpredators&quot; -- people who are &quot;not tethered to faith, family, religion or community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s about me, it&#39;s about my personal wants, needs and desires to the exclusion of anyone and everything and most assuredly institutions,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We read news articles about other portions of Morgan&rsquo;s speech that were not included in the video clips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll share with you a political axiom that I think is appropriate today for what the Escambia County Sheriff&#39;s Office is currently facing,&quot; he said, according to the <em>Pensacola News Journal.</em> &quot;When forced to swallow (excrement) ... it is recommended to swallow it whole and for God&#39;s sake, don&#39;t chew it. We&#39;ve been handed a couple of these here recently, and I&#39;m doing my best to choke them down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/08/escambia_county_sheriff_david_morgan_his_bizarre_defense_of_the_shooting.html\">Slate</a> wrote that the word Morgan used was &quot;turds.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audience laughed, and Morgan then discussed the apparent &quot;lack of race relations&quot; in the county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was of the opinion, until just recently, that we have built some bridges in the community, and obviously we have not,&quot; he said. &quot;No one is more appalled by this than I ... I will also tell you that we intend to stay the course.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A headline that appeared on many websites&nbsp;quoted a Florida sheriff as saying &quot;blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The articles include video clips of Escambia Sheriff David Morgan&nbsp;giving a Rotary Club address about black-on-white crime and the local outrage over the shooting of a black man by two white police officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stories use real quotes from Morgan, but not the one given most prominence in the headline.
