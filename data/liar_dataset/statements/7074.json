This is not a model to replicate for our seniors.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found that Lonegan&rsquo;s 60 percent figure is on the mark. A recent study estimated that only about 40 percent of office-based physicians in the Garden State were accepting new Medicaid patients last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain how the Medicaid system works in New Jersey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost Medicaid services provided in New Jersey are done through a managed care system. Under that system, the state contracts with private insurers, who manage the patients&rsquo; health care and pay the doctors directly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome services in New Jersey are still covered on a fee-for-service basis, in which doctors are paid by the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back up his claim, Lonegan directed us to a study by Sandra Decker, an economist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s National Center for Health Statistics. That study was outlined in an article published in the August 2012 edition of a journal called Health Affairs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study was based on the responses of 4,326 physicians to a nationwide survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics from February 2011 to June 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that study, Decker estimated that about 40 percent of New Jersey doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients in 2011. To be more precise, the percent of such physicians in the Garden State is likely between 28 percent and 53 percent, according to the study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat roughly 40 percent estimate represents the lowest percentage for any state and much less than the national average of 69.4 percent, the study shows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy don&rsquo;t more physicians accept Medicaid patients? One reason appears to be about money: the less they&rsquo;ll get paid, the less likely physicians will take on those patients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe fee-for-service rates paid by states have been measured by how they compare with Medicare fees. Decker&rsquo;s study shows that states with greater Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratios tended to have a higher percentage of physicians accepting new Medicaid patients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey has ranked at the bottom for fee-for-service Medicaid payments in recent years, according to different studies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt remains unclear how those fee-for-service rates compare to what some New Jersey doctors are getting paid to treat Medicaid patients on a managed care basis. Those managed care fees are negotiated between the physicians and the insurance companies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState officials are not involved in those negotiations, and thus don&rsquo;t know how much the doctors receive, according to Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Stephen Zuckerman, a health policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, told us the two sets of rates are often similar, but doctors may get paid more in managed care systems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, under the health care reform enacted in 2010, certain doctors providing primary care services to Medicaid patients in both fee-for-service and managed care are supposed to receive 100 percent of Medicare rates for 2013 and 2014, according to federal regulations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBrian Cook, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, said in an e-mail that the fee increase applies to every state, and federal officials expect it to attract more physicians to accept Medicaid patients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an op-ed last month, Lonegan claimed: &quot;Sixty percent of New Jersey doctors do not accept Medicaid patients.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat statement is backed up by a recent study estimating that roughly 40 percent of New Jersey doctors were accepting new Medicaid patients in 2011. The study also suggests that fewer physicians accept such patients in states with lower Medicaid payment rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/politifact_nj_steve_lonegan_sa_1.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-08T17:43:42.120040", "ruling_date": "2012-11-14T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Conservative activist Steve Lonegan says 60% of New Jersey doctors don\u2019t accept Medicaid patients", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservative-activist-steve-lonegan-says-60-new-je", "ruling_link_text": "Doctors are saying no", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAsbury Park Press, <a href=\"http://www.app.com/article/20121023/NJNEWS11/310230135\">PROS &amp; CONS: Medicare will be saved by providing choices</a>, Oct. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Health News, <a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2012/august/06/third-of-medicaid-doctors-say-no-new-patients.aspx\">Study: Nearly A Third Of Doctors Won&#39;t See New Medicaid Patients</a>, Aug. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/06/study-one-third-of-doctors-wouldnt-take-new-medicaid-patients-last-year/\">Study: One-third of doctors wouldn&rsquo;t take new Medicaid patients last year</a>, Aug. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tForbes, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/08/07/health-affairs-study-one-third-of-doctors-wont-accept-new-medicaid-patients/\">&#39;Health Affairs&#39; Study: One-Third of Doctors Won&#39;t Accept New Medicaid Patients</a>, Aug. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHealth Affairs, In 2011 Nearly One-Third Of Physicians Said They Would Not Accept New Medicaid Patients, But Rising Fees May Help, August 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Steve Lonegan, New Jersey director of Americans for Prosperity, Oct. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/8178.pdf\">Physician Willingness and Resources to Serve More Medicaid Patients: Perspectives from Primary Care Physicians</a>, April 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ppt/nchs2012/SS-04_DECKER_A.pdf\">Physician Acceptance of New Medicaid Patients by State in 2011</a>, Aug. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAvalere Health LLC, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/health/rhc/documents/nj_almanac_summary.pdf\">2006 New Jersey Health Care Almanac</a>, November 2006<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHealth Affairs, <a href=\"http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/3/w510.full?keytype=ref&amp;siteid=healthaff&amp;ijkey=zIlVwERUIscyU\">Trends In Medicaid Physician Fees, 2003&ndash;2008</a>, April 28, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Henry J.
