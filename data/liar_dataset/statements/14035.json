Bob Cortes, R-Altamonte Springs, faced a series of questions from Rep. David Richardson, D-Miami Beach, after introducing <a href=\"http://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=59591&amp;SessionId=83\">HB 7101</a>, one of several measures under consideration in the legislative session that would increase access to charter schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like public schools, charter schools receive state funds. The key difference is they are privately managed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richardson was curious about the bill&rsquo;s provision that specifies that a charter school operator may use assets of their charter school for K-12 educational purposes in &quot;other schools.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These other schools, would they also have to be a not-for-profit or could they be a for-profit?&quot; Richardson asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cortes said, &quot;They would have to be a school within their own network. So part of the charter school system itself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So does that mean the other schools would have to be a 501(c)(3)?&quot; Richardson asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All&nbsp;charter schools are not-for-profit,&quot; Cortes said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cortes&rsquo; bill passed in the House by an <a href=\"http://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/floorvote.aspx?VoteId=17171&amp;BillId=59591&amp;SessionId=83&amp;\">81-39 vote</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same argument resurfaced in debate of &quot;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article142044034.html\">schools of hope</a>&quot; legislation that would create a $200 million fund to lure charter schools to under-performing districts. Rep. Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, said, &quot;Under Florida state statute, a charter school is a non-profit organization, so there is no such thing in Florida as a for-profit charter school.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statements jumped out to us because there&nbsp;have been problems with charter schools being used to benefit people privately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida law technically requires charter schools&nbsp;to be nonprofits. But the system is largely run by for-profit companies, which Cortes&#39; statement leaves out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not-for-profit, or not?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charter-school solution was originally touted as a way to give families &mdash; particular those in low-income areas &mdash; another option for schooling. Critics say too many taxpayer dollars have been shifted to the private companies that run charter schools to the detriment of traditional public schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, are all charter schools in Florida not-for-profit? Technically speaking, a not-for-profit is a type of organization that does not earn profits for its owners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cortes cited a provision of a Florida statute (<a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/1002.33\">1002.33 sec 12(i)</a>) as evidence of this claim, which mandates that a charter must organize as, or be operated by, a nonprofit organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida Department of Education echoed Cortes&rsquo; evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audrey Walden, the agency&rsquo;s press secretary, said the defining document that sets the academic, financial and organizational performance benchmarks for a charter school is determined by the local school district and the nonprofit charter school board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charter governing board can choose to enter into contracts with private entities to provide services and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But, ultimately, performance and accountability rests with the nonprofit governing board -- which, when it enters into a charter agreement with its local school district, is subject to the same Sunshine Laws and School Accountability System that pertains to all public schools in Florida,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More to the story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all charter schools operate in the same way. And sometimes nonprofit charter governing boards enter into contract with for-profit companies.&nbsp;The management company does not manage the governing board, but&nbsp;rather it handles&nbsp;certain aspects of the operations of the school under a contract with the governing board.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/cashing-in-on-kids/article1939199.html#storylink=cpy\"><em>Miami Herald</em>&rsquo;s examination</a> of South Florida&rsquo;s charter school industry found several instances of for-profit management companies controlling charter schools&rsquo; day-to-day operations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Herald</em> found examples of charter schools relinquishing total control of their staff and finances to for-profit management companies. In Miami-Dade County, the Life Skills Center paid 97 percent of its income to cover fees incurred by a management company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, the governing board of two affiliated schools tried to &quot;eject&quot; the management company&rsquo;s managers. As a result, the management company withheld money from the school and threatened to press charges against people within the school from trying to get it back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Herald </em>also found that some owners of the management companies also control the land and buildings used by the charter school. Owners of Academica Corp., the state&rsquo;s largest charter school management company based in South Miami, collected almost $19 million a year in lease payments on school properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other cases, it found that the school&rsquo;s nonprofit board were full of people with ties to the for-profit management companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend continues across the nation.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/when-charter-schools-are-nonprofit-in-name-only\">ProPublica </a>reported that several charter schools around the country funneled all of their revenue to a for-profit company hired for day-to-day operations including schools in New York and Ohio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for the state&#39;s largest teachers union, the Florida Education Association, sent us a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5UxEjnGdbLOeUdhUkRDZWVQaDQ/view?usp=sharing\">report </a>that summarized the agency&rsquo;s arguments against&nbsp;&quot;schools of hope&quot; legislation. The FEA isn&rsquo;t completely against charter schools, but its&nbsp;website <a href=\"https://feaweb.org/charter-schools\">says</a>,&nbsp;&quot;While some charters adhere to the original idea, and have shown some success, many charters have become for-profit drivers for large corporations bent on taking over our public schools.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cortes said that all charter schools are not-for-profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Florida provision requires charter schools to be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization. This technical talking point omits that many nonprofit charter school boards&nbsp;enter in to contracts with for-profit companies. Some for-profit charter school management companies have drawn increasing scrutiny over the years for how they&rsquo;ve controlled the school&rsquo;s money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-04-25T12:56:10.734299", "ruling_date": "2017-04-27T12:22:28", "ruling_headline": "Are all Florida charter schools not-for-profit?", "ruling_headline_slug": "are-all-florida-charter-schools-not-profit", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but there are profits in the system", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange, Rep.
