Ted Cruz has talked tough on immigration, saying he would deport <a href=\"http://national.suntimes.com/national-world-news/7/72/2642255/ted-cruz-vows-deport-12-million-illegal-immigrants\">all 12 million undocumented immigrants</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN&rsquo;s Wolf Blitzer asked Cruz what is wrong with letting the &quot;good ones&quot; come back to the United States during the Feb. 25 GOP debate in Houston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz referenced a <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-thorny-economics-of-illegal-immigration-1454984443\">Feb. 9<em> Wall Street Journal </em>article</a> and said Arizona&rsquo;s strict immigration laws have prompted undocumented immigrants to flee the state. As a result, it has become tougher for business owners in the state to find skilled workers, but at the same time state spending decreased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state. ...&nbsp;Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they&#39;re spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop, are seeing wages rise. That&#39;s who we need to be fighting for.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizona is no stranger to controversy with some of its immigration laws. But has the departure of undocumented immigrants after legislation&nbsp;helped Arizona&rsquo;s economy to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to fact-check Cruz&rsquo;s complex immigration claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, some background on Arizona immigration policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why did immigrants leave? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizona&rsquo;s undocumented immigrant population was on the climb prior to 2007, according to a <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/12/11/unauthorized-trends/\">Pew Research Center study</a>. The population peaked in 2007 with about 500,000 undocumented immigrants in-state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But from 2007 to 2012, the undocumented immigrant population dropped 40 percent. However, immigrants across the state were <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2010/0610/Hispanics-abandon-Arizona-fleeing-economy-immigration-law\">already leaving</a> because of the December 2007 recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizona&rsquo;s housing market crashed and construction jobs, one of the state&rsquo;s major sectors, dried up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immigrants &quot;have left long before the passage of these anti-immigration laws,&quot; said Lisa Maga&ntilde;a, an associate professor in the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizona passed Proposition 200 in 2004, which <a href=\"http://civilrights.org/immigration/arizona/?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">requires citizenship</a> to receive social services such as childcare and housing assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state passed Proposition 300 two years later, which bars in-state tuition for college students without a <a href=\"http://national.deseretnews.com/article/4740/how-arizonas-immigration-policies-have-fared-in-the-past-decade.html\">lawful immigration status</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the meat of Arizona&rsquo;s policies toward undocumented immigrants did not start until 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizona required employers to use the federal <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify\">E-Verify system</a> in 2008, which requires an employee to have a Social Security number to legally work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, then-Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law in April 2010. The measure allowed law enforcement officers with &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/immigration/analysis-of-arizonas-immigration-law.aspx\">reasonable suspicion</a>&quot; to ask for a person&rsquo;s immigration papers when engaging in a stop. Most of the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, but last September a U.S. District Court Judge <a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/sb-1070-immigration-law-update-activists-want-new-law-to-curb-racial-profiling\">upheld the law&rsquo;s provision</a> that allows police to question the immigration status of those they suspect are undocumented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Welfare</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welfare has &quot;never gone&quot; to undocumented immigrants, Liz Schott, a senior fellow and welfare expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, some children of undocumented immigrants are <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jul/01/fact-checking-immigration/\">eligible for benefits</a> if they were born in the United States and are citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration,&nbsp;noted that these U.S.-born children could share their cash welfare benefits with their undocumented parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, Arizona spent more than $121 million in cash welfare. In 2014, they spent more than $32 million on cash welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Schott, Arizona just spends more in <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/tanf_spending_az.pdf\">other welfare areas</a>, such as child-care assistance for those working and/or attending school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They&rsquo;re spending it all, they&rsquo;re just spending it elsewhere,&quot; Schott said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because it is difficult to determine how many undocumented immigrants receive cash welfare, it&rsquo;s hard to credit this drop to people leaving the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prisons</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for state prisons, Arizona&rsquo;s Department of Corrections tracks noncitizens, either documented or undocumented, with a felony conviction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From fiscal year 2010, which ran from July 2009 to June 2010, to fiscal year 2015, the state&rsquo;s noncitizen prison population has declined almost 23 percent, but that&rsquo;s just about 1,400 inmates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The daily cost of keeping a noncitizen in a state prison hasn&rsquo;t changed much, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fiscal year 2010, it cost $59.85 per day to house a noncitizen. In fiscal year 2015, it cost $61.55. Because of the dip in noncitizen inmates, that&rsquo;s a savings of almost $28 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, overall state spending on prisons has increased almost 17 percent between 2008 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elliott Pollack, CEO of his own Scottsdale-based economic consulting firm, said Cruz&rsquo;s rationale bothers him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The cause and effect might be there to some extent, but I just don&rsquo;t see how it saves hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; Pollack said. &quot;There&rsquo;s no evidence of that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Camarota said the departure of undocumented immigrants &quot;makes things a little better.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Could he (Cruz) be right? He could be,&quot; Camarota said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Cruz&rsquo;s points are subject to error. Camarota also notes that undocumented immigrants &quot;paid something&quot; in taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A February 2016 report from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that Arizona&rsquo;s undocumented immigrants pay <a href=\"http://www.itep.org/pdf/immigration2016.pdf\">more than $231 million</a> a year in state and local taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Education </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On education, the state also does not track spending on undocumented immigrants in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal article Cruz described uses the state&rsquo;s decline in intensive English student enrollment -- about 80,000 students between 2008 and 2012 -- as a potential cost-saving measure, noting that it could save the state about $350 million per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it&rsquo;s a combination of factors,&quot; Arizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said, noting that the decline could be attributed to students leaving the system or being reclassified elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, that measure correlates intensive English with undocumented immigrants, which isn&rsquo;t tracked to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Cruz campaign for comment but did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said, &quot;spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; because of Arizona&rsquo;s exodus of undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s far from clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s technically possible to receive cash welfare through U.S.-born children, undocumented immigrants do not receive cash welfare directly. And, the state&rsquo;s prison and education budgets do not solely account for those without papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even then, any potential savings would be hard to calculate. It is not an apples to oranges comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recession played a significant role in Arizona&rsquo;s immigrant population decline, too. There&rsquo;s been no noticeable windfall in the state budget for welfare, education and prisons that we could document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Cruz&rsquo;s claim as Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-03T18:25:42.344737", "ruling_date": "2016-03-03T19:19:21", "ruling_headline": "Has Arizona\u2019s economy improved because of its immigration laws?
