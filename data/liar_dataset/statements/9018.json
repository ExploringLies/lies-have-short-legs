An Austin History Center <a href=\"http://www.austinlibrary.com/ahc/faq1.htm\"><u>web page</u></a> says the city, originally Waterloo, was purchased to be the capital of the Republic of Texas in March 1839 and renamed in honor of Stephen F. Austin. The city was incorporated on Dec. 27, 1839.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Austin&rsquo;s early years, the chart indicates, the population doubled even more frequently than Leffingwell said. Specifically, the population surged six-fold from 1840 to 1860, going from 553 to 3,493, according to the chart, while over the next 20 years, the number of residents increased three-fold, to 11,013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The population doubled in the next 20 years, reaching 22,258 in 1900, the chart shows, before nearly doubling over the next 25 years, reaching 42,174 in 1925, up 90 percent from 1900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took 15 years for the population to double afresh; it reached 87,930 in 1940, according to the chart. Twenty years later, the chart shows, Austin&rsquo;s population of 186,545 was more than double its 1940 population. It took 23 years for another doubling, according to the chart, with the 1983 population reaching 373,541. Some 25 years later, in 2008, the city&rsquo;s population of 750,525 was double its 1983 population, the chart shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get the most up-to-date sense of growth from the chart, we also looked at whether the mayor&rsquo;s claim holds up if we look back in time starting in 2013 when Austin had 842,750 residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That 2013 tally was almost double the city&rsquo;s population 25 years earlier. Gauged another way, the 2013 population was more than double Austin&rsquo;s population of 417,033 in 1985. So, that doubling took 28 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telles of the mayor&rsquo;s office also pointed us to a <a href=\"ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/GIS-Data/planning/compplan/community_inventory_Demographcs_v1.pdf\"><u>city report</u></a> featuring a graphic (below) showing Austin&rsquo;s population growth since 1900. &quot;Austin&rsquo;s growth has been very close to doubling every 20 years,&quot; the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QEOffdU-l3t47JVx64VaNQ4XGBA0cj41id0WAZFW2XKIjgwz9EcrbghXY6hu7EyMyuWVc2AUwY9s-TIrEmcS8NXtkIoFRT_d-GySP2C27z3Ya8OtzEFR_tmD30D3KA\" style=\"height:447px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leffingwell said Austin is a &quot;city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s right per changes in population, making this historical statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-06T18:00:02.744131", "ruling_date": "2014-03-07T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Austin's population has doubled every 25 years or so since its founding", "ruling_headline_slug": "austins-population-has-doubled-every-25-years-or-s", "ruling_link_text": "Get off my lawn", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsZae3IU1tiWXOdkzfS8A_5K-1ax46at1QvzDfRBUAA/pub\"><u>Email</u></a>, Reyne Christopher Telles, manager, media relations, City of Austin, March 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chart, <a href=\"http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Demographics/population_history_pub.pdf\"><u>&quot;City of Austin Population History 1840 to 2013,&quot;</u></a> on City of Austin website (accessed March 4, 2014)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Austin mayor", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Lee", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1079, "last_name": "Leffingwell", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "lee-leffingwell", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/leffingwell2010.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1079/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.mayorleffingwell.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Austin is &quot;a city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "his \"State of the City\" address", "statement_date": "2014-02-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 203, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/203/", "subject": "City Government", "subject_slug": "city-government", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 293, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/293/", "subject": "Population", "subject_slug": "population", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/14/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
