John Kasich signed it on March 31. They hope to have the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSB 5 is designed to give public employers more control over labor contracts to deal with declining revenue. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSharply reducing collective bargaining for public workers, the new law gives management a strong hand at the bargaining table because it eliminates binding arbitration in favor of a system that is weighted toward local governments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe replacement of binding arbitration has been a cornerstone issue for Republicans. Kasich made it a priority of his administration, arguing that public unions are too powerful at the bargaining table and that taxpayers had no say in costly labor contracts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCleveland Police Patrolmen&#39;s Association President Steve Loomis and other labor leaders rallying for repeal said the new law effectively eliminates the ability of unions to negotiate at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, SB 5 explicitly gives police and fire unions the right to collectively bargain for wages and safety equipment. PolitiFact Ohio asked Loomis to explain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He (Kasich) is not taking away our right to sit at the table,&quot; he said. &quot;He is taking away the right to collectively bargain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As it stands right now, both sides negotiate to an end or to a neutrally agreed upon position. If we come to an impasse, we solicit a professional arbitrator, usually American (Arbitration Association).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe neutral, third-party arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement, Loomis said, and is empowered to impose a contract settlement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder SB 5, if a union and governmental body cannot agree on a contract, a fact-finder from the State Employment Relations Board must be appointed to make recommendations. If the union and management reject the recommendations, the legislative body that oversees the workers, such as a city council, must vote to choose between the &quot;last, best&quot; offers of the workers and management.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the council does not act, the management offer becomes the new contract. And if council approves the higher-cost offer, there is a procedure by which both offers can be placed on the ballot to let voters choose.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&#39;s no more neutrality,&quot; Loomis said. &quot;One party gets to decide the outcome. The city council -- the people that we are negotiating with -- gets to decide whether the fact-finder&#39;s report is acceptable or not. If they decide it&#39;s acceptable, then we&#39;re done. If they decide it&#39;s unacceptable, then we go to arbitration. Who are the arbitrators? City council. So there is no collective bargaining here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When you listen to the governor and he talks about &#39;I&#39;ve given them the tools to control their costs,&#39; that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s talking about. He means &#39;I&#39;ve given them the ability to create their own contracts by unfair arbitration.&#39; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new process is, in fact, heavily weighted by design for local officials and government bodies -- and for taxpayers, say SB 5 supporters such as Rep. Louis Blessing, a Cincinnati Republican.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder binding arbitration, &quot;an unelected arbitrator can force a spending decision on local officials and the people they represent,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no consent of the governed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSafety forces were given binding arbitration as part of Ohio&#39;s 1983 collective-bargaining law for public employees. In what was considered a trade-off, that law banned strikes by police and firefighters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview, Senate President Tom Niehaus was asked what leverage or recourse would be left for safety forces without binding arbitration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They&#39;re still going to have civil-service protections,&quot; he told The Columbus Dispatch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSen. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, one of six Republicans who voted against SB 5, said it imposes a &quot;fundamentally rigged process&quot; giving managers an unfair advantage over safety workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There is no collective bargaining process (with Senate Bill 5),&quot; said another of the six, Sen. Tim Grendell of Chesterland. &quot;Senate Bill 5 replaces public worker collective bargaining with public worker collective begging ... Under Senate Bill 5, we lose the ability to bargain.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo there is accuracy in Loomis statement. Even some top Republican legislators would agree with him. SB 5 does greatly reduce safety force workers&rsquo; collective bargaining abilities and gives management the last word on which offer is chosen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that last word kicks in if the two sides can&rsquo;t agree on a contract. Safety forces do still have the ability to try to negotiate terms on wages and safety equipment. That&rsquo;s a point of clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Loomis&#39; statement rates as Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-14T17:01:13.288806", "ruling_date": "2011-06-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Union President Steve Loomis says Ohio's new labor law effectively eliminates collective bargaining for police unions ", "ruling_headline_slug": "union-president-steve-loomis-says-ohios-new-labor-", "ruling_link_text": "Management gets the final word", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/04/ohio_lawmakers_unlikely_to_cut.html\">Ohio lawmakers unlikely to cut their own pay while Senate Bill 5 expected to hit public workers in the pocketbook</a>,&quot; April 09, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/04/new_collective_bargaining_law.html\">New collective bargaining law would have varying impact on school districts and cities, according to newspaper survey</a>,&quot; April 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/apr/19/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-new-state-labor-law-doesnt-cu/\">Gov.
