It was a disaster,&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/07/president-donald-j-trumps-weekly-address\">said</a> in his weekly radio address April 7. &quot;Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t the first time Trump claimed he <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/17/did-donald-trump-inherit-mess/\">inherited a mess</a>, or that he&rsquo;s turned things around at the border. He&rsquo;s recently emphasized statistics to show decreases in illegal immigration. In March, he said illegal immigration was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/22/donald-trump/trump-says-illegal-immigration-down-61-percent-ele/\">down 61 percent</a> since Election Day (Mostly True) and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/14/donald-trump/trump-says-after-executive-orders-illegal-immigrat/\">down 40 percent</a> since his first month in office (Mostly True).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Trump&rsquo;s story getting even better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found is that Trump is changing how he&#39;s doing the counting in a way that emphasizes progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The &lsquo;64 percent reduction&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get to the 64 percent reduction, Trump isn&rsquo;t looking at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as he did when he talked about the decrease between January and February.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, he&rsquo;s looking at the year-over-year reduction (March 2016 vs. March 2017), the White House told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection data show that in March 2017 border patrol made <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration\">12,193</a> apprehensions at the southwest border. In March 2016, there were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Oct/BP%20Total%20Monthly%20Apps%20by%20Sector%20and%20Area%2C%20FY2000-FY2016.pdf\">33,316</a> apprehensions. That&rsquo;s a 63.4 percent decrease year-over-year. Add in people who were deemed inadmissable to the country and you reach 64 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you looked at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as Trump did last month, the drop would not have been as dramatic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From February 2017 to March 2017, border patrol apprehensions dropped about 35 percent, not 64 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Point being, Trump picked the number that showed the biggest decrease, when last month he calculated the figure a different way. Importantly, a&nbsp;listener to Trump&#39;s weekly radio address would have no way of knowing Trump changed his measuring stick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the specific numbers, Trump&rsquo;s rhetoric and tough immigration stance can be credited for the decreases, experts have told us. But they caution against making early conclusions about the effect Trump&rsquo;s policies have had.&nbsp;Changes on the ground usually take longer to materialize, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oh, Canada?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While data backs Trump&rsquo;s claim of decreases at the U.S.-Mexico border, the northern border has actually seen an increase&nbsp;in illegal immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As we increasingly secure the southern border, won&#39;t that put more pressure on the northern border and other ports of entry?&quot; Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., asked John Kelly, Department of Homeland Security secretary, during an April 5 Senate committee hearing on border security and public safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly said security concerns were not at the same level in the northern border as they are in the southern border. But that sector also needs attention, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We obviously need to watch it, one of the things the Canadians recently did was to allow ... Mexicans to travel to Canada without visas and we&#39;re seeing a little bit of increase in Mexicans coming illegally into the United States from the north,&quot; Kelly said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Since&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/06/28/canada-lift-visa-requirements-mexico\">Dec. 1, 2016</a>&nbsp;Mexicans do not need a visa to visit Canada.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all fiscal year 2016, there were <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Oct/BP%20Total%20Monthly%20Apps%20by%20Sector%20and%20Area%2C%20FY2000-FY2016.pdf\">2,283</a> border patrol apprehensions at the northern border, compared to 408,870 at the southern border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It depends on how you define last month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House said Trump was speaking about year-over-year changes, from March 2016 to March 2017.
