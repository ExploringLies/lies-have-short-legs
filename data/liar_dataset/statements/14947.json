Both deaths have been the subject of conspiracy theories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We noticed that the supposed real name of the hitman -- Terrence Wilekenmeyer -- was the same last name as Ezekiel Wilekenmeyer, a pen name used by one of the biggest <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/may/31/If-youre-fooled-by-fake-news-this-man-probably-wro/\">purveyors of fake news, Christopher Blair</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Fox News spokeswoman Jaclyn Giuliano said that Hannity had no involvement whatsoever in the story alleging a Clinton hit man confessed on his deathbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Patriot Report&rsquo;s website claims that it offers &quot;solid conservative perspective on the issues of the day&quot; and aims to &quot;to equip the current generation of American Patriots with the right information&quot; to support and defend the unalienable rights of man.
