Experts told us this is common in politics, though the practice has come under criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Campaign fund-shifting</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Romney&rsquo;s failure to reach the White House in 2008 and 2012 is not without a silver lining. It elevated Romney&rsquo;s public stature, gave him staying power in Republican politics and left him with a substantial &mdash; and flexible &mdash; bankroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign finance rules have long allowed a candidate to hold on to surplus campaign funds indefinitely, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the group Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission rules, candidates can also make unlimited transfers of funds between campaigns, Holman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It happens all the time,&quot; said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a campaign finance policy think tank. &quot;House members take their bankrolls to run for the Senate, senators to run for president. As long as the money was raised for a federal office under federal contribution limits, it&#39;s okay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holman argued just because the practice is widespread doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s fair. He said the policy can create an uneven playing field and permits candidates to use funds in a way that&rsquo;s contrary to donors&rsquo; intentions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A donor may have supported Romney&rsquo;s presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee, but not support Romney&rsquo;s new campaign for Senate in the primary or general election,&quot; Holman said. &quot;Yet, under the law, Romney has the authority to use those donors&rsquo; funds without getting their approval.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Romney followed suit</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of 2018, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0134592D:US-romney-for-president-inc\">Romney for President, Inc.</a>, the nonprofit organization that supported Romney&rsquo;s failed 2012 presidential bid, had roughly $1.3 million cash on hand.
