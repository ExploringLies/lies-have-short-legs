Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs,&quot; Trump tweeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Millions of jobs? That would be a massive shot in the arm for the economy. For a sense of scale, Wal-Mart, the nation&rsquo;s largest private employer, <a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/02/30_largest_employers_in_the_us.html\">has 2.3 million employees</a>; the second-largest, Yum Brands, which includes Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, has about 500,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is, the White House has been cagey about exactly where this projection comes from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, Trump&rsquo;s use of the word &quot;millions&quot; represents a thousand-fold expansion from what Trump had said just days earlier, when he told the audience in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/21/president-trumps-speech-arab-islamic-american-summit\">speech in Saudi Arabia</a>: &quot;Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, over two days of inquiries to the White House, officials were unable to provide us with full details of the $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which itself is just a portion of the $400 billion investment package Trump cited in his speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the <em>Washington Post</em> Fact Checker <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/05/26/president-trumps-claim-that-hes-already-saved-millions-of-jobs-on-his-foreign-trip/?utm_term=.916112dddc43\">asked</a> the White House for details about Trump&rsquo;s tweet, a White House official responded that Trump was referring to &quot;benefits to trade from the entire trip from Saudi Arabia to the G7&quot; -- that is, including Trump&rsquo;s meetings with the heads of other advanced industrialized nations in Europe toward the end of the trip. (It&rsquo;s not clear what trade deals were discussed in the European portion of the trip.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, assuming &quot;millions&quot; of jobs from unspecified investments is not justified, economists say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s not enough information to substantiate his claims on millions of jobs,&quot; said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, here&rsquo;s what we know and don&rsquo;t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The arms deal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued a <a href=\"http://www.dsca.mil/news-media/news-archive/fact-sheet-intended-sales-saudi-arabia-foreign-military-sales\">news release</a> on May 20 saying that the United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to a $110 billion package on five main areas: border security and counterterrorism, maritime and coastal security, air force modernization, air and missile defense, and cybersecurity and communications upgrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The release detailed six specific areas, with links to documents that offered a dollar amount. They were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/saudi-arabia-various-munitions-and-support\">Munitions and support</a>: $6.8 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/kingdom-saudi-arabia-multi-mission-surface-combatant-mmsc-ships\">Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships</a>: $11.25 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/kingdom-saudi-arabia-ksa-ammunition-royal-saudi-land-forces-rslf\">Ammunition for the Royal Saudi Land Forces</a>: $500 million;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/kingdom-saudi-arabia-m1a2s-saudi-abrams-main-battle-tanks-and-m88ala2-heavy\">Saudi Abrams Main Battle Tanks and HERCULES Armored Recovery Vehicles</a>: $1.15 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/kingdom-saudi-arabia-ch-47f-chinook-cargo-helicopters\">Chinook cargo helicopters</a>: $3.51 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/kingdom-saudi-arabia-74k-persistent-threat-detection-system-ptds-aerostats\">Persistent Threat Detection System Aerostats</a>: $525 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That totals $23.74 billion, leaving $86 billion from the package unspecified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using other available data, John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, told PolitiFact that he can estimate perhaps $50 billion in arms sales, &quot;most of which was initiated under Obama,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bloomberg calculations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reporters at Bloomberg have written <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-22/guide-to-400-billion-in-saudi-u-s-deals-black-hawks-to-oil\">several articles</a> about the deals signed in the Saudi portion of the trip, focusing on agreements outside the $110 billion arms deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Agreements signed by Saudi oil company Aramco: $50 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Commitments by Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund to an infrastructure investment fund with the Blackstone Group. (Blackstone, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-26/the-kushners-the-saudis-and-blackstone-behind-the-recent-deals\">reported separately</a>, has close ties to the family of Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.) $20 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; General Electric memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia: $15 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Honeywell International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $3.6 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; McDermott International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $2.8 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Jacobs Engineering Group memorandum of understanding: $250 million;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Rowan Companies memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for offshore drilling rigs: $7 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Rowan memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.2 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nabors Industries memorandum of understanding on well and rig services on an existing joint venture worth $9 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nabors memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.6 billion;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Weatherford International memorandum of understanding: potential value of $2 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That works out to about $112 billion, coming on top of the $110 billion in arms sales. Bloomberg cited a few more items without specific dollar amounts, including a jet purchase from Boeing by SaudiGulf Airlines, and a joint venture between National Oilwell Varco and Saudi Aramco for the manufacture of drilling rigs and equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves more than half of Trump&rsquo;s $400 billion figure -- just for the Saudi leg of the trip -- undisclosed, to say nothing of what deals may have been struck in the European portion of the trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for now, the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/05/24/trump-says-his-saudi-deal-will-create-jobs-the-companies-involved-arent-so-sure/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.489cbf536555\">reported</a> that several key CEOs of companies that signed deals have been a lot more restrained than Trump about promising specific numbers of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is absolutely zero chance that the trip created millions of jobs,&quot; said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. Even if jobs were created -- possibly in the thousands, not the millions --&nbsp;&quot;this may or may not lead to any net job creation, since the Fed could easily offset it with higher interest rates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that deals struck on his first foreign trip as president created and saved &quot;millions of jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t know for sure how many jobs will be created or saved -- nor, despite the certainty of his language, does Trump -- but the evidence at this point is so thin and so premature as to be little more than puffery or wishful thinking.
