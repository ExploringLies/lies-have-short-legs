Is it true that Kirk called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans and, second, that Kirk had no objection to Trump&rsquo;s call for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants? We checked the record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>What Kirk said</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duckworth&#39;s deputy campaign manager Matt McGrath said in an email she was referencing a statement Kirk made in May 2013 during an interview with Fox 32 Chicago political editor Mike Flannery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kirk told Flannery: &quot;My top priority is to arrest the Gangster Disciple gang, which is 18,000 people. I would like to do a mass pickup of them and put them all in the Thomson Correctional Facility. I will be proposing this to the assembled federal law enforcement: ATF, DEA and FBI.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXPwjJCI0xY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kirk made that statement in response to the January 2013 shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was struck in the back by a stray bullet during a gang-related shooting on Chicago&rsquo;s south side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gangster Disciples is an African-American gang from the city&#39;s south side and has an estimated 18,000 members, though its membership could be as high as 30,000, according to the Chicago Crime Commission&rsquo;s press officer John Pastuovic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/bobby-rush-mark-kirk-chicago-crime-092027\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>drew criticism</u></a> from the media as well as from Kirk&rsquo;s colleagues in Congress, including U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill, who called the proposal an &quot;upper middle class elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kirk acknowledged in July 2013 that his plan to arrest every member of the Gangster Disciples was &quot;not actually that practical.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, not only does Duckworth&#39;s tweet take what Kirk said out of context, it also implies he supported the general mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans, even though Kirk never mentioned race or used the term &quot;African-Americans&quot; during his interview with Fox 32 Chicago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>What about Kirk on deportation?</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as for Duckworth&rsquo;s claim that Kirk &quot;was apparently fine with Trump&rsquo;s call for mass deportation?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 4, Trump appeared on <em>NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt</em>, where he reiterated his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants if he were to become president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a May 6 interview with CNN before Trump&rsquo;s primary-clinching win in Indiana, Kirk said he would support Trump as the Republican nominee, calling Trump&rsquo;s candidacy a &quot;net benefit&quot; for his own campaign in Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kirk withdrew his support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee on June 7 after Trump said an American-born federal judge of Mexican ancestry couldn&rsquo;t preside fairly over civil fraud lawsuits against the defunct Trump University because he has called for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Kirk did back Trump knowing his position on illegal immigration, Kirk has made clear in the past he does not support Trump&rsquo;s controversial immigration policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2015, Kirk<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-illinois-sen.-mark-kirk-to-donald-20150713-embeddedvideo.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>told reporters</u></a> at news conference he had a message for Trump: &quot;In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, &#39;Donald Trump callate&#39; shut up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Kirk&rsquo;s congressional voting record suggests he would not be &quot;fine&quot; with deporting 11 million immigrants living here illegally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleni Demertzis, the Kirk campaign&rsquo;s communications director, noted in an email the senator supported and voted for the high-profile comprehensive immigration reform package in June 2013, which first would have secured the border and then created a tough but fair pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, among other things. But that measure never made it to a vote in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to his pro-immigration reform stance, Kirk in October 2015 broke ranks with his party and was the only GOP Senator who voted to preserve federal funding for &quot;sanctuary cities.&quot; However, Kirk did vote in favor of increasing penalties from two years to five years for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country illegally after being deported, denied entry or removed for other reasons, voting largely along party lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duckworth tweeted: &quot;Kirk, who called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans, was apparently fine with Trump&rsquo;s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Kirk did call for the mass arrest of the Gangster Disciples, an African-American gang estimated to have 18,000 members, Duckworth&rsquo;s tweet takes Kirk&rsquo;s statement out of context and gives the impression he had called for the general mass incarceration of 18,000 African-Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duckworth also fails to acknowledge Kirk walked back his statement shortly after he made it. More importantly, Kirk did not mention race when he originally called for a &quot;mass pickup&quot; of the Gangster Disciples gang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Kirk being &quot;apparently fine&quot; with mass deportation, his congressional voting record on immigration shows he supports comprehensive reform that would both improve border security and implement a tough, but fair pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- not to mention he was the lone Republican senator to vote against legislation that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Duckworth&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01372967-dbec-46d3-9db4-d22894cda756\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01372967-dbec-46d3-9db4-d22894cda756</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-11T21:11:35.254982", "ruling_date": "2016-07-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tammy Duckworth says Mark Kirk called for the 'mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans'", "ruling_headline_slug": "says-mark-kirk-called-mass-arrest-18000-african-am", "ruling_link_text": "Puts words in his mouth", "ruling_state": "Illinois", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt</em>,&nbsp;Donald Trump<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/presumptive-gop-nominee-trump-goes-one-on-one-with-lester-holt-679516739918\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>&nbsp;interview</u></a>, May 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, Mark Kirk<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/06/politics/mark-kirk-tammy-duckworth-illinois-senate-donald-trump/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>&nbsp;interview</u></a>, May 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email with Matt McGrath, Duckworth&rsquo;s deputy campaign manager, June 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Chicago Crime Commission&#39;s press officer, John Pastuovic, June 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fox 32 Chicago,&nbsp;Mark Kirk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXPwjJCI0xY\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>interview</u></a>, May 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Kirk,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkKirk/status/740266906922438656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>tweet</u></a>, June 7, 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;
