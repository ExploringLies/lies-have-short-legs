If Doherty&rsquo;s claim is true, it would support his contention that taxpayers could actually save a lot of money if waste and fraud are reined in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther fact-checkers have looked at Medicare fraud estimates.

Tom Coburn<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/27/tom-coburn/coburn-says-20-percent-every-medicare-dollar-goes-/\"> a Half True ruling</a> after he claimed that the country spent $80 billion a year on fraudulent Medicare payments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile we waited to hear back from Doherty&rsquo;s campaign, we did some research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) -- the investigative arm of Congress -- has since 1990 labeled Medicare a &quot;high-risk program,&quot; because of the ample opportunities for error and abuse in the system that covers 47 million elderly and disabled Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GAO issued a<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125579.pdf\"> report</a> a year ago that gave a total figure for &quot;improper payments&quot; for 2010 of $48 billion. That was the equivalent of 9.4 percent of the $509 billion in total spending that year for Medicare.<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GAO pulled the figure from<a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/afr/2010-sectioniii-oai.pdf\"> the Fiscal Year 2010 financial report</a> for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicare and came up with an estimate for improper payments based on a random sampling of 82,000 Medicare claims. The GAO report did not include questionable payments made under Medicare&rsquo;s Part D prescription drug program, for which no estimate was provided by HHS -- so the total amount of improper payments is likely higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report defines an improper payment as &quot;any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount [including overpayments and underpayments] under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTypical types of fraud that fall under the umbrella of improper payments include billing for services that were not provided or were not medically necessary, over-billing for services, paying kickbacks and stealing providers&rsquo; or patients&rsquo; identities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s important to note that the $48-billion figure cited by the GAO is for all &quot;improper payments,&quot; not just the fraud that Doherty is targeting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GAO report did <em>not</em> isolate the amount of money spent specifically on fraudulent Medicare payments because the Department of Health has no method to detect or measure fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut officials do believe that the level of fraud is high.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2009/05/t20090506d.html\">May 6, 2009 testimony</a> before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Daniel Levin, HHS inspector general, estimated that &quot;more than $60 billion each year&quot; is lost to health care fraud, citing a figure from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA), a group that includes members from private insurance companies, law enforcement and government agencies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany media outlets and critics of government health care programs have used that $60 billion figure when describing the extent of Medicare fraud. Doherty&rsquo;s campaign referred us to several news stories that cite the number, including pieces by 60 Minutes and USA Today that both quoted Attorney General Eric Holder.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those stories used an incorrect description of the number because it covers the entire U.S. health care industry, including public and private providers, not just Medicare -- a big distinction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe watched the 60 Minutes piece cited by Doherty&rsquo;s campaign. Like other media reports, it does not give an attribution for the $60-billion figure. The USA Today piece with the $60 billion figure cites a speech at a national conference by Holder as its source of the information. In a transcript we found of the speech, however, Holder made it clear he was referring to fraud for the <em>entire</em> health care industry -- not just the Medicare fraud Doherty was talking about.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NHCAA generally estimates that fraud accounts for 3 percent of all health care spending. So in 2010, when the country spent $2.3 trillion on health care, the cost of fraud was estimated to be $69 billion,<a href=\"http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/TR/transcripts/2010_0017_0014_TSTMNY.pdf\"> according to the association</a>. It did not come up with a specific figure for Medicare, but if we use its 3 percent estimate, then Medicare fraud would have amounted to about $15 billion in 2010 -- a quarter of Doherty&rsquo;s figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NHCAA also cites an<a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/financial-crimes-report-2010-2011\"> estimate</a> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that fraud amounts to between 3 and 10 percent of total spending on health care annually. If Medicare fraud were as high as 10 percent, it would have totaled about $51 billion in 2010 -- still less than Doherty&rsquo;s estimate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOthers have come up with higher estimates for health care fraud, but none have isolated a number for Medicare. They include Malcolm Sparrow, a former fraud investigator and detective chief inspector with the British police service who is now a professor at Harvard&#39;s Kennedy School of Government. He is the author of &quot;License to Steal,&quot; a book on health care fraud, and has testified before Congress on Medicare fraud, waste and related issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSparrow believes the amount of health care fraud is much higher than the 3 percent, or $69 billion, estimate by the NHCAA, but in an email to us he emphasized that there are no &quot;valid estimates&quot; for Medicare fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrendan Doherty said there was $60 billion in Medicare fraud in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe truth is, nobody really knows how much money is spent on fraudulent Medicare claims. Even the government agency that regulates Medicare has not -- and apparently cannot -- come up with a firm figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile experts say the amount of fraud in the entire health care system could range from $69 billion to hundreds of billions of dollars, only the GAO study isolated improper payments for Medicare specifically. Its $48-billion estimate, which also includes wasteful spending, is $12 billion -- or 20 percent -- less than Doherty&rsquo;s number for fraud alone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t pull the $60 billion number from thin air. Staffers found multiple reports using that figure from credible media outlets. But those media outlets used it inaccurately.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s understandable why Doherty believed those reports -- especially for a number that&rsquo;s pretty squishy -- but if stamping out waste and fraud is indeed one of the core issues of his candidacy, he at least should have gotten his information from a first-hand source.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Doherty&rsquo;s statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
