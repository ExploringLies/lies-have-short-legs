PolitiFact rated the claim as Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGM had squared its government loans, but loans were only a fraction of more than $52 billion that the U.S. Treasury had committed to GM through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Most of the government&#39;s GM investment was converted to an ownership stake in the General Motors Co., the new company that emerged from bankruptcy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile several economists told PolitiFact the repayment was undeniably a sign of progress, the government&#39;s nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the government would end up losing $34 billion in TARP money extended to the automotive industry and auto finance companies. The CBO didn&#39;t break out how much of that was tied to GM, but GM received the largest portion of the total $85 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy last fall, however, the Treasury Department had revised its loss on the bailout downward, to $17 billion. Treasury officials declared the bailout a success.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut declarations of success, for the bailout or for GM, were not unanimous.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m not sure we can determine one year later that General Motors is successful,&quot; Rep. Jim Renacci said on the &nbsp;&quot;Sound of Ideas&quot; on WCPN 90.3 FM. He said, &quot;I think that for the company to pay back everything it owes, it would have to sell its shares at $143 a share . . . where the highest value of a General Motors share ever was $43, $44, $46, whatever the dollars were...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio asked the staff of the 16th District Republican about the underpinning of his numbers. They referred us to a blog posting that cited an analysis from last August by CNBC auto reporter Phil LeBeau, &quot;which states that for the federal government to recover its current net TARP outlays of $43 billion, each (GM) share would have to yield about $143 for the government to be repaid.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat figure was cited by other reporters, too, about that time, as GM filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of its stock that was projected for October.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut events overtook the $143 estimate. GM kept altering several factors in its IPO, and by the time it occurred last November, analysts listed a payback figure in the low $50 range. (By then, CNBC had taken down the LeBeau&rsquo;s posted analysis from its website.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe government sold part of its 61 percent stake in GM during the IPO in November, raising $13.5 billion and reducing its share in the company to 33 percent. Treasury also swapped some secondary shares, bringing in another $2.1 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTechnically -- and it&#39;s an important financial distinction to make -- the automaker does not owe the government anything. GM repaid the government by giving it the bulk of its stock -- leaving it up to Treasury to get a good return on investment. Given the rest of his statement, we think Renacci was talking about the government breaking even on that investment, not GM repaying the government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe government&rsquo;s stake in GM stands at $26.4 billion. Divide that by Treasury&#39;s 500 million stock shares and you get about $53 a share -- the price Treasury would have get to break even on the bailout. The Congressional Oversight Panel lists the break-even price as $54.28.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRenacci&#39;s staff told us that the record high for GM shares was $40.85, even lower than the congressman stated, &nbsp;in 1999. But according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago, and according to the oversight panel, GM&#39;s peak stock price was above $93 in April 2000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose figures are for the old GM that sought bankruptcy protection and reorganized. Stock prices for the new General Motors Co. closed at $36.70 on Feb. 7.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senior Treasury official who oversees TARP told the Congressional Oversight Committee that the government hopes to sell the rest of its stake in GM within the next two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinancier Steven Rattner, who was dubbed the administration&#39;s &quot;car czar&quot; as head of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, thinks taxpayers still could break even if Treasury is a little patient&quot; and holds its stock longer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSelling the stock at recent non-peak levels, the government would lose around $7 billion on the entire GM bailout.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does that leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRenacci relied on an outdated projection of the stock price needed for the government to fully recover its assistance to GM. The &quot;break-even&quot; price really is much closer to the current stock price than were initial projections. And Treasury&#39;s current loss level of $7 billion is less than half the $17 billion projected by Treasury last fall, when it declared the bailout a success.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the congressman is way off the mark with his citation of GM&rsquo;s highest-ever stock price.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether the new GM can be viewed as successful is a point we leave up for debate. But as to Renacci&rsquo;s claim about GM stock and the government recouping its TARP investment, we rate the statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-08T16:50:33.745634", "ruling_date": "2011-02-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
