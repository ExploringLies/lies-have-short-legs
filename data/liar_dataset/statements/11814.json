Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about the reluctance of the shooters&rsquo; neighbors to report suspicious activity by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik. They didn&#39;t want to be seen as using ethnic profiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie said what the neighbors saw had nothing to do with profiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These folks had weapons, they knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it,&quot; Christie said. &quot;That&#39;s not profiling, that&#39;s law enforcement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly interjected, &quot;They didn&#39;t know they were going to attack the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They knew they were talking about attacking people,&quot; Christie shot back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked for any reports of the neighbors saying they had an inkling of any plans for an attack. We didn&rsquo;t find any. We did find second-hand reports that weren&rsquo;t well sourced, and these were repeated primarily on right-leaning news websites<strong>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This excerpt from the conservative website <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/03/shooters-neighbor-didnt-report-suspicious-activity-for-fear-of-being-labeled-racist-video/\">Daily Caller</a> was typical:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;A neighbor of Farook&rsquo;s mother in Redland &mdash; said that another neighbor told him &quot;they had I guess been receiving packages &mdash; quite a few packages within a short amount of time, and they were actually doing a lot of work out in the garage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;She was kind of suspicious and wanted to report it,&quot; Elswick explained, &quot;but she said she didn&rsquo;t want to profile.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were many articles of this sort. All of them sourced back to a local ABC news affiliate broadcast and all of them had pretty much the same details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of these accounts supports Christie&rsquo;s assertion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, they talk about what the neighbors of Farook&rsquo;s mother saw, not the neighbors of Farook and Malik themselves. The mother lived in Redlands, not San Bernardino. We should also note that this account comes from a neighbor saying what he learned from another neighbor, not what he saw himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, no one was reported as saying that they thought an attack was being planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after the shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that neighbors and friends described the couple as &quot;quiet, religious people who didn&rsquo;t attract attention or suspicion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie said that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were talking about attacking the country. The most that was reported is that a neighbor of a neighbor of one of the shooter&rsquo;s mother said there was suspicious activity. There was no mention that a neighbor of the shooters themselves was suspicious, much less that a neighbor thought an attack was being planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie jumbled the details in the news. We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/18d28985-9171-4758-ba6d-6f150b004517\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/18d28985-9171-4758-ba6d-6f150b004517</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-28T22:53:25.994746", "ruling_date": "2016-01-28T23:07:14", "ruling_headline": "Christie says neighbors of San Bernardino shooters knew more than they did", "ruling_headline_slug": "christie-says-neighbors-san-bernardino-shooters-kn", "ruling_link_text": "No inkling of an attack", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Caller, <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/03/shooters-neighbor-didnt-report-suspicious-activity-for-fear-of-being-labeled-racist-video/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Shooter&rsquo;s Neighbor Didn&rsquo;t Report &lsquo;Suspicious Activity&rsquo; For Fear Of Being Labeled Racist</u></a>, Dec. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Townhall.com, <a href=\"http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/12/03/neighbor-didnt-report-suspicious-activity-of-san-bernardino-killers-for-fear-of-being-called-racist-n2088543\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Neighbor Didn&#39;t Report Suspicious Activity of San Bernardino Killers For Fear of Being Called Racist</u></a>, Dec. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Jihad Watch, <a href=\"http://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/12/sb-area-man-didnt-report-suspicious-activity-for-fear-of-being-called-racist\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>SB-area man didn&rsquo;t report suspicious activity for fear of being called racist</u></a>, Dec. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Mediate, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/syed-farooks-neighbors-didnt-report-suspicious-activity-for-fear-of-profiling/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Syed Farook&rsquo;s Neighbors Didn&rsquo;t Report &lsquo;Suspicious Activity&rsquo; For Fear of Profiling</u></a>, Dec. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Wall Street Journal,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/neighbors-acquaintances-shocked-that-couple-they-knew-are-shooting-suspects-1449188181\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Neighbors, Acquaintances Shocked That Couple Are San Bernardino Shooting Suspects</u></a>, Dec. 3, 2015</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Governor of New Jersey", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 27, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1251, "last_name": "Christie", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "chris-christie", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/christie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1251/", "total_count": 105, "true_count": 21, "website": "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/"}, "statement": "<p>Neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters &quot;knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa", "statement_date": "2016-01-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
