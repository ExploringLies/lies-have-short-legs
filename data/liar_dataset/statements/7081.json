Jason Isaac said in a <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/documents/2012/oct/19/download-our-2012-voters-guide/\">voters guide</a> to the Nov. 6, 2012, election. &quot;We have a spending problem.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Dripping Springs Republican, who went on to <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/shelton-leads-davis-in-early-sd-10-returns/nSytj/\">win his second term</a>, said: &quot;Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas&rsquo; per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe was responding to this question in the guide produced by the Austin and Texas chapters of the League of Women Voters: &quot;Since 2006, state educational funding has been reduced and student enrollment has increased. What measures would you propose to restore adequate funding to Texas schools?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince the 2011 Legislature modified school finance formulas -- sending schools $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same -- PolitiFact Texas has fielded a range of related claims. Recently, lawmakers have said Texas did not cut education spending (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/apr/12/susan-combs/comptroller-susan-combs-says-state-lawmakers-did-n/\">Pants on Fire</a>), raised education spending (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/feb/20/myra-crownover/myra-crownover-says-2011-legislature-increased-sta/\">Pants on Fire</a>) and raised education&rsquo;s share of the budget (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/oct/08/joe-straus/joe-straus-says-lawmakers-increased-share-state-sp/\">Mostly True</a>).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut none of those claims stretched back to the days of Guns &rsquo;N Roses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Isaac&rsquo;s campaign for the backup on his statement. Spokeswoman Ellen Troxclair replied with a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5blg2bkx5UDJhc00/edit?pli=1\">June 2010 report</a> from the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation citing <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5anl1ekxVdzVVdjA/edit\">1988</a>-<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2Wzr4_cemD5Um9oYVc3U21RMEE\">2008</a> total expenditures from the Texas Education Agency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome perspective: Texas enrollment has grown substantially in recent decades. Agency <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2Wzr4_cemD5LXY4M2RON2FnUk0\">data</a> showed an increase of 47 percent in Isaac&rsquo;s chosen time span, from 3.2 million pupils to 4.7 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking at the foundation report&rsquo;s data on expenditures, we first realized that Isaac&rsquo;s per-pupil statement had not been adjusted for inflation, in contrast to what he said in the guide. He gave a starting point of $3,659, which is the unadjusted amount for 1987-88. In 2008 dollars, it comes out to $6,659, confirmed by the foundation report and our math using the federal Consumer Price Index <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">online calculator</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWorking from 2008 dollars at both ends of the 20-year period yields a 66 percent increase, rather than the 201 percent increase Isaac&rsquo;s numbers indicated. That is, per-pupil spending increased at about one third the rate he suggested.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe first part of Isaac&rsquo;s claim came straight from the report, Troxclair said. And it checks out, according to our math and the education agency&rsquo;s data. From 1987-88 through 2007-08, using 2008 dollars to adjust for inflation, Texas&rsquo; total expenditures on education rose 142 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts suggested other flaws in Isaac&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, operating expenditures would be a better measure than total expenditures, we heard in interviews with Texas Association of School Boards spokesman Dominic Giarratani and school funding expert Lori Taylor, an associate professor at Texas A&amp;M University&rsquo;s Bush School of Government and Public Service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s because total expenditures fluctuate due to big-ticket construction projects that school districts mostly pay for on their own by issuing bonds. Operating expenditures more accurately reflect state budget dollars, they said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that over the 20 years singled out by Isaac, inflation-adjusted <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2Wzr4_cemD5Um9oYVc3U21RMEE\">operating expenditures</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5VTRrM3YzNDdGNU0/edit\">more than doubled</a>, rising 112 percent, or 42 percent per pupil.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTroxclair acknowledged what she called the &quot;wording error&quot; on the per-pupil inflation adjustment, but disagreed with the idea that Isaac should have relied solely on operating expenditures. &quot;Money spent on construction projects is still money being spent,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, Taylor noted that although Isaac said &quot;the past 20 years,&quot; his data set ends in 2008, overlooking the three most recent school years including the two affected by the cuts lawmakers approved in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s understandable in the case of the foundation&rsquo;s report, which was written in 2010. However, Isaac made his statement more than a year after lawmakers completed the 2012-13 budget. Even so, Isaac would not have been able to compare actual spending numbers for 2011-12, because they won&rsquo;t be published until spring 2013. The 2010-11 data was out, but also would not have included the 2011 legislative cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTroxclair told us Isaac relied on the 2010 report because it was the most comprehensive analysis available from the foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s budgeted amounts, rather than dollars actually spent, <a href=\"http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=2147495507\">came out</a> March 8, 2012, so we ran those over a 20-year period to see how the cuts might change the picture. Budgeted amounts for <a href=\"http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/aeis/92/district/227901.html\">1992</a>-<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2Wzr4_cemD5MkYydHlJMzhFdjg\">2012</a> showed mostly smaller increases than actual spending in 1988-2008, particularly in operating costs: Total budgeted spending was up 72 percent compared to <a href=\"http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/aeis/92/district/227901.html\">1992</a>, or 20 percent per pupil. Operating budgeted spending was up 69 percent, or 17 percent per pupil.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPencils down!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIsaac said, &quot;Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas&rsquo; per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s correct that, adjusted for inflation, total spending went up 142 percent from 1988 through 2008. But that leaves out recent years, including those affected by 2011&rsquo;s legislative changes. And focusing on the increase alone without taking into account growth factors, especially enrollment, can be misleading.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA different measure, budgeted total spending, rose 72 percent from 1992 through 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIsaac indicated that per-pupil spending had tripled after adjusting for inflation. The correct amounts show it didn&rsquo;t even double.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while Isaac&rsquo;s comment has an element of truth -- spending did increase -- his first declared fact lacks vital context and the second is a substantial overstatement. We rate the overall statement as Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-09T19:46:34.109070", "ruling_date": "2012-11-12T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jason Isaac says in past 20 years, Texas school spending rose 142% and per-pupil spending more than tripled when adjusted for inflation", "ruling_headline_slug": "jason-isaac-says-past-20-years-texas-school-spendi", "ruling_link_text": "Omits 2011 cuts, commits inflation error", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tLeague of Women Voters/Austin American-Statesman<a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/documents/2012/oct/19/download-our-2012-voters-guide/\"> Voters Guide</a>, Oct. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Ellen Troxclair, chief of staff for state Rep.
