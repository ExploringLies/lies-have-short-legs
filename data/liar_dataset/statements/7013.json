Charles Bass of wanting to privatize Social Security. But, in a recent TV ad, she let a supporter do her talking for her.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think Congressman Bass&rsquo; idea to privatize Social Security is a devastating idea,&quot; one voter, Janice Kelble, of Franklin, N.H., says in the ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ8lC6pj1co\">Janice</a>,&quot; which first aired on Sept. 6 on New Hampshire airwaves.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Bass just wants to risk Social Security on the stock market,&quot; Kelble suggests. &quot;Charlie Bass just plain does not understand the middle class.&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has heard these claims before. The attack has been a rallying cry of sorts for Democrats since George W. Bush was in office, and candidates are pulling the card once again this election season.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, we checked the same claim from Kuster this summer, rating it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/29/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-kuster-distorts-bass-record-social-security/\">Mostly False</a>. But, with the charge receiving renewed airtime with the ad, we decided to see if anything has changed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack in June, the Kuster campaign cited a 2001 House vote on then-President Bush&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/pcsss/pcsss.html\">Commission to Strengthen Social Security </a>as evidence of Bass&rsquo; support for privatization.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn December 2001, the 16-member commission issued its final report, which urged Congress to incorporate a system of private accounts for personal investment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith strong opposition from Democrats, the commission&rsquo;s recommendations never reached the floor of Congress. But, the House did consider a number of resolutions and amendments at the time, including <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll273.xml\">H.AMDT.245</a>, a Democratic-sponsored amendment that would have prohibited any funding of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBass joined each of his Republican colleagues at the time in voting against the amendment, which failed 188-238. But, analysts determined both then and now that the vote was more of a pre-emptive strike than a true endorsement of privatization.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He may have (supported privatization),&quot; Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/\">Cato Institute</a>, said back in June. &quot;Republicans generally did at that point, but this vote was certainly not a vote that could be read that way.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn both the current ad and in past claims, Kuster cites a 2005 news article as further evidence of Bass&rsquo; support for privatization. In this story, printed in the Eagle Times of Claremont, N.H., Bass offered support for then-President Bush&rsquo;s plan to introduce a private accounts option for Social Security beneficiaries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I support the establishment of private savings accounts because it allows low- and middle-income workers the chance to get ahead,&quot; Bass said, according to the Eagle Times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs noted in the prior ruling, Bass further clarified his stance that year with a statement issued the night Bush outlined his plan in his State of the Union address.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I am an advocate of the President&#39;s call for Social Security reform and will work with him in the next two years to save and protect this important program,&quot; Bass wrote at the time, according to the <a href=\"http://www3.nationaljournal.com/pubs/house/extra/SocSecfinal3.htm#3\">National Journal </a>and <a href=\"http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/22216/charlie-bass/\">Project Vote Smart</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome analysts argue that Bush&rsquo;s plan, to allow workers under 55 the option of directing up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into private accounts, is as close to privatization as the debate has reached in recent years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Virtually no one has proposed replacing all of Social Security with private accounts, Paul Van de Water, a seniors fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in the initial Kuster piece. &quot;Given the way the debate has evolved, being for &hellip; privatization doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re for privatizing the whole darn thing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, PolitiFact has determined in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/\">past rulings </a>that the private accounts option does not meet the standards of full privatization. First, it would be fully optional, and secondly, beneficiaries could opt to place only a portion of their payroll taxes into private accounts, qualifying as a partial privatization plan at best.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;To address this financial crisis facing the Social Security program, one such idea Congressman Bass has supported would create a program that would allow individuals to voluntarily place a portion of their money that they currently pay as part of the payroll tax and place it into a personal account,&quot; Bass spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne wrote in a June email to the Telegraph. &quot;Saying that (Bass) supports &lsquo;privatizing Social Security is pure political rhetoric devised by Democratic spin doctors to frighten seniors.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLittle if anything has changed since our past ruling on Kuster&rsquo;s claims about Bass&rsquo; support for privatization. The statements and votes that the Democrat references in support of her claim suggest Bass supported a move toward partial privatization, not full privatization as the claim suggests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKuster&rsquo;s claim was Mostly Falsethen, and it continues to be now.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-25T22:41:03.209411", "ruling_date": "2012-10-22T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ann McLane Kuster accused Charlie Bass of wanting to privatize Social Security", "ruling_headline_slug": "ann-mclane-kuster-accused-charlie-bass-wanting-pri", "ruling_link_text": "Old attack still not true", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAnn McLane Kuster, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ8lC6pj1co\">Janice</a>,&quot; Sept. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, &quot;Ann Kuster distorts Bass&rsquo; record on Social Security,&quot; June 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Journal,<a href=\"http://www3.nationaljournal.com/pubs/house/extra/SocSecfinal3.htm#3\">Where Members Stand on Social Security</a>, 2005<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProject Vote Smart,<a href=\"http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/22216/charlie-bass/\">Issue Positions (Political Courage Test)</a>, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t107th Congress,<a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll273.xml\">Roll Call 273</a>, July 25, 2001<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Eagle Times, New Hampshire congressman supports Bush&#39;s Social Security plan, March 24, 2005<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact.com,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/\">Barack Obama claims Republican leaders plan to privatize Social Security</a>, Aug. 18, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Attorney", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Ann", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 1913, "last_name": "McLane Kuster", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "ann-mclane-kuster", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AnnMcLaneKuster.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Hampshire", "edition": "New Hampshire", "edition_slug": "new-hampshire", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 47, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Hampshire Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/47/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1913/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://kusterforcongress.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays U.S. Rep.
