PolitiFact Ohio isn&rsquo;t either,&nbsp; because it sounded new to us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHas Ohio really has lost more of its population than 47 other states? Over what time period?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we decided to take a look.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau official state counts for the Census 2010, released on Dec. 21, only one state lost population from April 2000 to April 2010 and it wasn&rsquo;t Ohio &mdash; it was our neighbors to the north, Michigan.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tBut maybe Kasich flubbed his words and meant Ohio&rsquo;s population grew more slowly than every other state but two. That would be closer to the truth. Ohio&rsquo;s population grew 1.6 percent over the decade to just over 11.5 million people, according to the census figures.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnly Louisiana at 1.4 percent and Rhode Island at 0.4 percent grew at a more sluggish pace. Michigan&rsquo;s population dropped 0.6 percent. That would leave Ohio ranked 47th over the past decade in population growth.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOr, maybe the governor-elect was talking about some previous census figures. The census bureau had routinely put out annual estimates and other projections prior to issuing its official data drop in mid-December.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tBut even by earlier estimates and projections, Ohio did not lose population but gained more people, albeit at a much slower pace than most of the rest of the country.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tKasich is correct to be concerned.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tWhile Ohio&rsquo;s overall population is still seventh-highest in the country, the state&rsquo;s slower pace of<br />\r\n\tgrowth could also directly affect the pace at which Ohio&rsquo;s struggling economy recovers.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tAnother concern is that while Ohio hasn&rsquo;t lost population, other states are gaining new residents faster. The most immediate consequence of that for the state is a loss of clout in Washington, where Ohio will lose two of its 18 congressional seats and have fewer electoral college votes for presidential elections due to the population trends.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tWe offered the governor-elect the benefit the doubt, but from any angle you look at it, Ohio did not lose population from this year over last, or in 2009 from 2008, or this year compared to 2000.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tOn this one, Kasich doesn&rsquo;t need sensational talk to highlight a problematic issue.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Kasich&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-04T17:40:07.541169", "ruling_date": "2011-01-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio Gov.-elect John Kasich's claim of population losses doesn't add up", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-gov-elect-john-kasichs-claim-population-losse", "ruling_link_text": "Claim of decline doesn't add up ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div>\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau <a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/news/pdf/apport2010_table5.pdf\" id=\"byoy\" title=\"official state count\">official state count</a>, Dec. 21, 2010<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJohn Kasich interview, Dec. 14, 2010, Columbus, Ohio</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "Governor of Ohio as of Jan. 10, 2011", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 533, "last_name": "Kasich", "mostly_true_count": 18, "name_slug": "john-kasich", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/John_Kasich_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/533/", "total_count": 67, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://ohio.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Ohio has lost more population than every other state in the country except for two.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a news conference", "statement_date": "2010-12-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
