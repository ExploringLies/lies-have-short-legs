Allen&rsquo;s six years in office, he voted for budgets adding $3.1 trillion to the national debt -- that&rsquo;s $16,400 for every second Sen. Allen was in office,&quot; Radtke said in a <a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/2011/01/radtke-responds-to-media-inquiries-regarding-senator-allen-potential-candidacy/\">Jan. 17 news release</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s the price of a brand new, four-door Chevy Cobalt for ever second Allen was in the Senate &nbsp;2001 and 2007, according to a Google search. We revved our engines to see if Radtke is right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChuck Hansen, a spokesman for Radtke, said they based their calculation on &nbsp;the national debt growth between the last day of 2001 and the final day of 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was a mistake. &nbsp;The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The first spending votes Allen cast in the Senate were for the budget that began Oct. 1, 2001 -- some three months before Radtke started counting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the last spending votes Allen cast were for the budget that started Oct. 1, 2006 -- five weeks before his defeat -- and ended Sept. 30, 2007. That&rsquo;s some three months before Radtke stopped counting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo our period runs from Oct. 1, 2001 to Sept. 30, 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we visited a <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">U.S. Department of Treasury website</a>&nbsp;to determine the national debt on each date. Rounding off, it started at $5.806 trillion and ended at $9.008 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means federal budgets passed during Allen&rsquo;s term increased debt by $3.202 trillion. Did the former Senator approve all of it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongress does not hold simple up or down votes on the federal budget. Instead, it votes on a series of appropriations for various department. We turned to <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/\">THOMAS</a>, a Library of Congress web site that records the action on Capitol Hill. We found Allen supported each of about four dozen &nbsp;appropriation bills that came to Senate floor during his term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we made no deductions from the $3.202 trillion increase in debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen served 2,193 days in the Senate -- from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 4, 2007. That&rsquo;s 189,475,200 seconds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 per second. That&rsquo;s almost $497 a second more than Radtke credited to Allen. So we&rsquo;ve added a kickin&rsquo; stereo to the basic features of our Chevy Cobalt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut before you get angry at Allen, consider this: The debt has risen by $54,684.24 a second since he left office. And Webb has voted &quot;yea&quot; on each 27 appropriations bills that helped get it there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn case you&rsquo;re wondering, we have now upgraded to a brand new, fully-loaded Lincoln Navigator every second. We&rsquo;re talking about a luxury SUV with leather seats, parking sensors, GPS, rain-detecting wipers and sound that will make you think you&rsquo;re in Carnegie Hall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly problem is it gets 14 miles a gallon, so it will cost us down the road.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRadtke said the Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,400 every second he was in the Senate. Her formula was a bit flawed; the actual figure is $16,896.68 a second.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find it hard to penalize Radtke for a slight mistake she made in her opponent&rsquo;s favor. So we rate her statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-23T13:32:26.156796", "ruling_date": "2011-01-23T20:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jamie Radtke says debt grew by $16,000 every second of George Allen's senate term ", "ruling_headline_slug": "jamie-radtke-says-debt-grew-16000-every-second-geo", "ruling_link_text": "She actually underestimated the total", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRadtke for Senate, <a href=\"http://radtkeforsenate.com/2011/01/radtke-responds-to-media-inquiries-regarding-senator-allen-potential-candidacy/\">news release,</a>&nbsp;Jan. 17, 2011.<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Chuck Hansen, spokesman for Radtke, Jan. 19, 2011.<br />\r\n\tInterview with Steve Ellis, vice-president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Jan. 19, 2011.<br />\r\n\tTreasuryDirect, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It</a>.<br />\r\n\tTHOMAS, <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/home/approp/app11.html\">Appropriation Bills</a>.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.kbb.com/\">Kelley Blue Book,</a> New Car Prices.</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Jamie", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 977, "last_name": "Radtke", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "jamie-radtke", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/JAMIE_RADTKE.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/977/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 3, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tGeorge Allen voted for budgets that increased the national debt by $16,400 for every second he served in the U.S. Senate.</p>", "statement_context": "a news release", "statement_date": "2011-01-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "consultant", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "George", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 831, "last_name": "Allen", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "george-allen", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/George__Allen.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/831/", "total_count": 27, "true_count": 8, "website": "http://www.georgeallen.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
