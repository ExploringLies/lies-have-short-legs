Bush and the previous Republican majority in Congress -- policies that Democrats blame for helping cause the current recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used this argument in responding to a Sept. 23, 2010, event in which House Republicans unveiled a &quot;<a href=\"http://boehner.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=208421\" id=\"r_oz\" title=\"Pledge to America\">Pledge to America</a>&quot; -- a statement of policy principles that House Republicans intend follow.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=2911\" id=\"mjaf\" title=\"a Sept. 23 post\">A Sept. 23 post</a> on Pelosi&#39;s &quot;Gavel&quot; blog said, &quot;Answering a question this morning about the preamble to the GOP&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pledge to America,&rsquo; House Republican Leader John Boehner admitted to American workers, their families and small businesses, &#39;We are not going to be any different than we&rsquo;ve been.&#39; Finally, we get the truth. Congressional Republicans want to return to the same failed economic policies that cost us 8 million American jobs, doubled our national debt, hurt millions of Americans, and wrecked our economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe post included an eight-second video clip in which Boehner says, &quot;And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we&#39;re not going to be any different than we&#39;ve been.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to see if Pelosi&#39;s post accurately reflected what Boehner, an Ohio Republican, had said at the event.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we listened to the <a href=\"http://www.gop.gov/resources/library/audio/Pledge-9-23-10.mp3\" id=\"jj4b\" title=\"audio recording\">audio recording</a> of the question-and-answer session from which the quote was taken. Here&#39;s the full question and answer:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tQuestion: &quot;Legislatively, how do you plan to honor families, traditional marriage, life and the private and faith-based organizations that form the core of our American values?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBoehner: &quot;I think if you look at House Republicans over the course of the last year, two years <strong>-- </strong>for that matter, the last 10 years -- you will see that, by and large, we have supported those pro-family, traditional values issues. And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we are not going to be any different than what we&#39;ve been. We are going to stand up for those things that we believe in.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Boehner was not in fact talking about the party&#39;s economic policies. He was answering a question about what he called &quot;pro-family, traditional values issues.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose are two very different things, and the extremely tight editing of the eight-second clip in Pelosi&#39;s blog post suggests to us that whoever edited the clip realized that Boehner&#39;s full answer would not have made the point they wanted to make.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOthers have found plenty to criticize about the Republican plan. On the <em>Daily Show, </em>Jon Stewart <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/thu-september-23-2010-king-abdullah-ii-of-jordan\" id=\"fspj\" title=\"mocked Republican statements at the Pledge event\">mocked Republican comments at the Pledge event</a> by intersplicing them with nearly identical statements made by GOP leaders in the past.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut it&#39;s a gross mischaracterization to make that point by touting Boehner&#39;s comment and saying that he was referring to economic policy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPelosi&#39;s office told us they think it&#39;s fair to interpret his words broadly. &quot;Leader Boehner, like others in his party, may wish to take his statement back, but he was clearly in an event, speaking about the Republican agenda when he said it,&quot; said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami. &quot;The preamble is a prelude to the pledge, which is a roadmap right back to failed policies of the past.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&#39;s an opinion that many Democrats share, but we still feel that the Speaker&#39;s office significantly distorted Boehner&#39;s comments. Even if you believe that the Republicans would indeed return to Bush-era economic policies, it does not justify making that point by twisting Boehner&#39;s comment, which was specifically tailored to social issues. Nor does it justify running a video clip that is highly abbreviated and removes all context from Boehner&#39;s statement. For these reasons, we rate the blog post Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-24T13:21:17.191128", "ruling_date": "2010-09-24T13:37:27", "ruling_headline": "Nancy Pelosi cites John Boehner in saying GOP plans return to old economic policies", "ruling_headline_slug": "nancy-pelosi-cites-john-boehner-saying-gop-plans-r", "ruling_link_text": "Boehner was talking about social issues, not economics", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNancy Pelosi, <a href=\"http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=2911\" id=\"s2z4\" title=\"post\">post</a> on the Gavel blog, Sept. 23, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse Republican Conference, <a href=\"http://www.gop.gov/resources/library/audio/Pledge-9-23-10.mp3\" id=\"xhwu\" title=\"audio recording\">audio recording</a> of event to launch the House Republican &quot;Pledge to America,&quot; Sept. 23, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tComedy Central, <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/thu-september-23-2010-king-abdullah-ii-of-jordan\" id=\"ug.y\" title=\"video\">video</a> of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Sept. 23, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Michael Steel, spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner, Sept. 23, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Nadeam Elshami, spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sept. 23, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "House Minority Leader", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Nancy ", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "California", "id": 59, "last_name": "Pelosi", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "nancy-pelosi", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-nancypelosi.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/59/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays John Boehner &quot;admits &#39;we are not going to be any different than we&rsquo;ve been&#39; &quot; <font>by returning to </font>&quot;the same failed economic policies&quot; that &quot;wrecked our economy.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2010-09-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
