This time it was <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\"><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Stephen </span></span></span></span>Archambault,  one of the three Democrats who have filed for Attorney General.<br /><br />At  the June 28 Democratic state convention in the 17th-floor ballroom of  the Providence Biltmore hotel, Archambault complained that Blue Cross,  which enjoys non-profit status, spent excessively when it equipped its  new Providence headquarters. <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\"><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">The company has been a popular target of politicians, in part  because of its double-digit rate increase requests; it was awarded an  average 9.8 percent increase July 7.</span></span></span></span><br /><br />\"We  don't have to look too far to see a $125 million building across the  way with a $30,000 granite table and a state-of-the-art gym that  Governor Schwarzenegger could have trained for the Olympiad in,\"  Archambault said.<br /><br />Spending $30,000 on a table seems pretty  extravagant.<br /><br />If it's true.<br /><br />The Archambault claim came the  same day Democrat Bill Lynch, who is running for Congress, drew a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/28/bill-lynch/Bill-Lynch-campaign-claims-Blue-Cross-spent/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pants On Fire ruling\">Pants On Fire ruling</a> from us  because he claimed -- with no proof -- that Blue Cross spent $25  million on decor for its new building. <br /><br />We asked the  Archambault campaign to put its cards on a, presumably, much cheaper  table and say where the candidate got <em>his</em> information.<br /><br />Spokesman  Rob Horowitz said the campaign couldn't back up the claim because the  information came from a source, whose name he would not disclose.<br /><br />\"We  received the information from what we believe to be a reliable source.  But we don't have first-hand knowledge and at this juncture cannot  confirm it,\" said Horowitz. \"As a result, we will not be using it any  more and it shouldn't have been included in the speech the other night.  The broader point about the cost of the building we believe to be  completely on target.\"<br /><br />When we asked Blue Cross about the table,  Kimberly Reingold, director of media relations and external affairs,  said she was unable to find a granite table, not even in the board room,  where the table is <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">made of wood.</span></span><br /><br />So we went back to the  Archambault campaign and asked Horowitz to contact the secret source and  identify the room containing the swanky table.<br /><br />Then we called  Blue Cross and asked for a tour of the new 13-story building that  overlooks Waterplace Park. We were told by Reingold that customer  service areas were off-limits because of federal patient confidentiality  laws. We offered to wear earplugs so we couldn't overhear comments from  the customer service representatives. We also offered to sign a  confidentiality agreement vowing to keep any medical information secret.  Reingold said <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\"><span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">neither offer was </span></span></span></span>acceptable,  although we could see other areas of the building.<br /><br />Our plan was  to get the location of the table from the Archambault source and, if we  weren't taken there on the tour, ask to see the room where it  was purported to be.<br /><br />Horowitz, Archambault's spokesman, reported a  few days later that the campaign's source was not returning phone  calls.<br /><br />So we took the tour anyway. We were allowed to view a  customer service area from afar and didn't see any furnishings that  appeared lavish. We saw the gym, with new exercise  equipment, along with a room for exercise classes (employees pay $16 a  month to use the facility), but nothing out of the ordinary for a  building with 1,100 employees.<br /><br />\"There are no granite tables,\"  insisted Thomas Bovis, assistant vice president of corporate real estate  and administrative services, who coordinated the development  of the building.<br /><br />At the end of the tour, we asked to see the  board room to confirm Reingold's report. Reingold said it was off limits  because we would have to pass areas where we might be able to see  documents with customer information.<br /><br />She then agreed to take our  camera to the board room and snap photos from two different angles.  Based on those pictures, the table looks like it's made of wood.<br /><br />We  give the Archambault campaign credit for retracting its claim as soon  as we challenged it.<br /><br />If this tale of the extravagant table takes a  turn, we'll recalibrate the Truth-O-Meter. But for now, it's  registering a rock-solid Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-09T11:22:56.197557", "ruling_date": "2010-07-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Archambault says Blue Cross headquarters has a $30,000 granite table", "ruling_headline_slug": "archambault-says-blue-cross-headquarters-has-30000", "ruling_link_text": "Campaign took source for granite", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Speech, Steve Archambault, Rhode Island Democratic State Convention,  June 28, 2010<br /><br />Interviews, Rob Horowitz, spokesman, Steve  Archambault for Attorney General campaign, July 1, 2 and 6, 2010<br /><br />Email  and interviews, Kimberly Reingold, director of media relations and  external affairs, Blue Cross of Rhode Island, July 1, 2, 6 and 8, 2010<br /><br />Interview,  Thomas Bovis, assistant vice president of corporate real estate and  administrative services, Blue Cross of Rhode Island, July 8, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Lawyer", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Stephen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Rhode Island", "id": 497, "last_name": "Archambault", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "steve-archambault", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Archambault.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Rhode Island", "edition": "Rhode Island", "edition_slug": "rhode-island", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 6, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Rhode Island Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/6/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/497/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://archambaultforattorneygeneral.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Blue Cross headquarters has \"a $30,000 granite table.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a speech at the state Democratic convention", "statement_date": "2010-06-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 101, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/101/", "subject": "Corporations", "subject_slug": "corporations", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
