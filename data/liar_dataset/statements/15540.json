Mike Huckabee, about the Red Hen restaurant owner. He told <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eAFENXpQxo\">Laura Ingraham</a> on her radio show that that after Sanders and her husband left, the rest of her family went to another restaurant, and the Red Hen owner &quot;followed them across the street, called people, and organized a protest yelling and screaming at them from outside the other restaurant and creating this scene.&quot; Huckabee made a similar statement to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuoKLLLpiuE\">Trish Regan on Fox</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/huckabee-sanders-red-hen-protest/\">Snopes</a>, a fact-checking website, rated the claim Mostly False after interviewing businesses near the restaurant. Snopes found that Sanders&rsquo; inlaws went to another nearby restaurant, the Southern Inn, and at some point in the evening members of the group encountered Wilkinson outside on the street, but it&rsquo;s not clear whether Wilkinson followed them there or simply happened to be passing by. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>PolitiFact contacted the Lexington, Va. police to ask if they had any reports of a threat against Sanders and did not get a reply.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Red Hen&rsquo;s request for President Donald Trump&rsquo;s spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave the restaurant has fueled some exaggerations on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders after biz was destroyed by booting her,&quot; said a June 26 <a href=\"http://houstonpost.co/2018/06/26/red-hen-owner-just-issued-sick-threat-to-sarah-sanders-after-biz-was-destroyed-by-booting-her/\">headline</a> by The Houston Post, a pro-Trump website which has the same name as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Post\">now defunct newspaper</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook&#39;s News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Red Hen owner&rsquo;s decision to ask Sanders to leave led to a firestorm of both criticism and support, we found no evidence that she threatened Sanders. The Houston Post story doesn&rsquo;t contain any information about a threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened at the Lexington, Va., restaurant: on June 22, Stephanie Wilkinson asked Sanders to leave her restaurant after staff members raised concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilkinson told the <em>Washington Post</em> that Sanders works in an &quot;inhumane and unethical&quot; administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m not a huge fan of confrontation,&quot; Wilkinson said. But &quot;this feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders left without incident and later <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1010536237457924096\">tweeted</a>: &quot;Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for<a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS\"> @POTUS</a> and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we found no evidence that Wilkinson threatened anyone, <em><a href=\"https://www.roanoke.com/news/local/protesters-gather-outside-red-hen-restaurant-as-owner-steps-down/article_9d32cab9-4458-5731-a8e5-c814973a0e96.html\">The Roanoke Times</a></em> reported that a man was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after he tossed a bucket of chicken manure on the sidewalk beside the restaurant and shouted, &quot;Make America great again,&quot; Trump&rsquo;s 2016 campaign slogan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no contact information on the Houston Post&rsquo;s website. We sent an email to The Red Hen and did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Houston Post wrote that &quot;Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders.&quot; Wilkinson, the owner of the Red Hen, asked Sanders to leave her restaurant June 22.
