But the party ultimately did not endorse, because no one received the required 60 percent of the vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo did he win the day?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSoon after the vote, Fitzgerald posted on Facebook:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Thank you everyone for the tremendous support at the Republican Party of Wisconsin Convention and to have won the majority support! Thank you!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the days after the convention, he claimed &quot;a win&quot; on Twitter and on his <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeff-Fitzgerald/246749222039602\">Facebook page</a>, citing a Wisconsin Radio Network Web story headlined, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wrn.com/2012/05/fitzgerald-climbs-to-first-place-convention-finish/\">Fitzgerald climbs to first-place convention finish</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;ICYMI: Here&#39;s an article covering my win at the Republican Party of Wisconsin&#39;s State Convention. The same grassroots activists who support Governor Scott Walker supported me because they want to see bold reforms in Washington!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFitzgerald, the Assembly Speaker, did not use any form of the word &quot;endorse&quot; -- a prudent move since none of the four GOP candidates (Fitzgerald, businessman and former congressman Mark Neumann, former Gov. Tommy Thompson and businessman Eric Hovde) won the state party&rsquo;s official support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat set his reaction apart from that of Neumann, who <a href=\"http://neumann2012.com/landing/convention/index.htm\">declared &quot;victory&quot;</a> despite finishing second in the final vote, while <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Neumann.docx.doc\">strongly implying he was endorsed</a>. (We rated that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/17/mark-neumann/senate-candidate-mark-neumann-says-state-republica/\">False</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, even the article cited by Fitzgerald doesn&rsquo;t go quite as far as calling Fitzgerald&rsquo;s showing as a &quot;win.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s our take on Fitzgerald&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA first-place showing in the final showdown -- and majority support -- do represent a &quot;win&quot; for Fitzgerald. Or, as he tweeted, &quot;success.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the claim needs some clarification in that it was not a formal endorsement -- the prize everyone was seeking. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-dueling-endorsement-claims-from-neumann-fitzgerald-4e5fahg-152024995.html\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s website</a>)</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-17T17:11:06.872303", "ruling_date": "2012-05-17T20:14:06", "ruling_headline": "Senate candidate Jeff Fitzgerald says he scored a \u2018win\u2019 in state Republican endorsement contest", "ruling_headline_slug": "senate-candidate-jeff-fitzgerald-says-he-scored-wi", "ruling_link_text": "\u201cLittle Fitz\u201d had a big day", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPhone interview with Jeff Fitzgerald, U.S. Senate candidate, May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFitzgerald <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jeff-Fitzgerald/246749222039602\">Facebook page</a>, accessed May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Radio Network, <a href=\"http://www.wrn.com/2012/05/fitzgerald-climbs-to-first-place-convention-finish/\">&quot;Fitzgerald climbs to first-place finish</a>,&quot; May 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview with Chip Englander, Neumann campaign spokesperson, May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann<a href=\"http://neumann2012.com/landing/convention/index.htm\"> website appeal</a>, accessed May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeumann<a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Neumann.docx.doc\"> email appeal</a>, May 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel,<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/thompson-others-failed-to-win-gop-senate-endorsement-4b5d4fj-151266195.html\"> &quot;Senate hopefuls fail to win endorsement</a>,&quot; May 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Incoming speaker of state Assembly", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jeff", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 889, "last_name": "Fitzgerald", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "jeff-fitzgerald", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jeff_Fitzgerald.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/889/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/assembly/asm39/news/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays he posted a &quot;win&quot; in the Republican Party of Wisconsin endorsement contest in the U.S. Senate primary.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "Facebook and Twitter posts", "statement_date": "2012-05-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
