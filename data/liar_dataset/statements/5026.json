Rick Perry&#39;s presidential candidacy attacks two Perry rivals for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, suggesting that their records prove they are not conservatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the style of an old newsreel, the ad from Make Us Great Again, which was formed this year by Austin lobbyist Mike Toomey, a longtime Perry ally, highlights several criticisms that have been lobbed at the former U.S. House speaker and former Massachusetts governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the charges the ad aims at Gingrich is that he joined U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., &quot;in support of global warming.&quot; We take the wording to mean that Gingrich aligned with Pelosi on the issue of global warming, a pairing that has drawn renewed attention lately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar claim is also being heard in a television ad placed in Florida and Iowa this month by another super PAC, <a href=\"http://www.restoreourfuture.com/\">Restore Our Future</a>, which is <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/pro-mitt-romney-group-attacks-newt-gingrich-on-the-air-in-florida/1206644\">staffed</a><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/pro-mitt-romney-group-attacks-newt-gingrich-on-the-air-in-florida/1206644\"> and funded by supporters of Mitt Romney</a>. The ad attacks Gingrich over &quot;a ton of baggage&quot; and includes the statement that Gingrich &quot;teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National looked into that claim for a Dec. 21, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/21/restore-our-future/attack-ad-says-newt-gingrich-aligned-dems-global-w/\">fact-check</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Restore Our Future ad cites the website <a href=\"http://newtfacts.com/\">Newtfacts.com</a>, which lays out a list of &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one: &quot;Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming.&quot; It is followed by a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaZFfQKWX54\">link</a> to the Pelosi-Gingrich spot, in which Gingrich sits on a couch next to Pelosi, who at that time was the House speaker but now is the minority leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&rsquo;t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?&quot; Pelosi says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; Gingrich answers, &quot;but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi: &quot;We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gingrich: &quot;If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, &quot;Together, we can do this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization that works to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. Formerly the Alliance for Climate Protection, it&rsquo;s now known as the Climate Reality Project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called <a href=\"http://climaterealityproject.org/\">ClimateRealityProject.org</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUXNodLskGM\">interview</a> with the online news show <em>The Young Turks</em> in December 2011, Gore said that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi. It was part of a larger campaign featuring &quot; &#39;unlikely pairs,&#39; who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,&quot; according to a 2008 news story in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the current campaign season, Gingrich has expressed regret about making that ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a section of his campaign website devoted to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newt.org/answers#GlobalWarming\">answering the attacks,</a>&quot; Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News&rsquo; Brett Baier in November that making the ad with Pelosi was &quot;probably the dumbest single thing I&#39;ve ever done.&quot; It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/07/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-he-never-favored-cap-and-trade/\">supported</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/07/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-he-never-favored-cap-and-trade/\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/07/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-he-never-favored-cap-and-trade/\">it</a> in the past) and that he favors increased domestic oil drilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our sense is the super PAC&#39;s video accurately touches on Gingrich teaming with Pelosi against global warming. We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-22T20:45:28.667275", "ruling_date": "2011-12-23T09:56:16", "ruling_headline": "Pro-Perry super PAC says Gingrich teamed with Pelosi on global warming", "ruling_headline_slug": "pro-perry-super-pac-says-gingrich-teamed-pelosi-gl", "ruling_link_text": "Partners in video", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Make Us Great Again, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQcSxvdmq84&amp;context=C3611d80ADOEgsToPDskJItkRatfrM-vnaLsZuOCjL\">video</a>, posted Dec. 21, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/21/restore-our-future/attack-ad-says-newt-gingrich-aligned-dems-global-w/\">Attack ad says Newt Gingrich aligned with Dems on global warming</a>,&quot; Dec. 21, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "super PAC", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1619, "last_name": "Make Us Great Again", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "make-us-great-again", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-politifact-mugs-mug-independentgroup_____________________3.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1619/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://makeusgreatagain.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Newt Gingrich aligned with Nancy Pelosi on global warming.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a video ad", "statement_date": "2011-12-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Most scientists agree that climate change is real and humans are causing it.
