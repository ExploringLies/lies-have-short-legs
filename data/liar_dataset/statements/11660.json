Terry McAuliffe is making it clear that helping public schools will be the &quot;top priority&quot; in a two-year budget he&rsquo;ll propose to the General Assembly this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since 2008, we have cut 5,000 positions&quot; in state public schools, he said Dec. 3 to journalists attending an annual AP Day at the Capital seminar hosted by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. McAuliffe, a Democrat, made a similar claim Nov. 24 during his monthly radio show on WTOP in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether the governor is correct. So we turned to the official source for Virginia school statistics: &nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.doe.virginia.gov/statistics_reports/supts_annual_report/index.shtml\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Superintendent&#39;s Annual Report</u></a>, a database kept by the state Department of Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brian Coy, McAuliffe&rsquo;s director of communications, said the start date for the governor&rsquo;s claim refers to the state budget year that began July 1, 2007, and ended June 30, 2008. We accept that, because it&rsquo;s bureaucratic parlance to refer to budgets by the latter year they were in effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2007-08 budget is significant, because it was one of the last spending plans to be carried out before the last recession gripped the state and forced deep cuts in programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public education employment was at an all-time high in Virginia that school year, with 191,013 full-time equivalent workers. That fell to 186,202 employees during the 2013-14 school year, the latest figures available. That&rsquo;s a drop of 4,811 full-time equivalent jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost one-fourth of those lost jobs belonged to instructors - a group that includes teachers, principals, assistant principals, librarians and guidance counselors. The number of full-time instructors dropped from 103,303 in 2007-08 to 102,140 in 2013-14 - a decline of 1,163.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that enrollment increased slightly during that time span. As a result, the average number of students per instructor rose from 11.5 to almost 12.1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 70 percent of the job cuts went to &quot;administrative, service and support personnel.&quot; This group includes school secretaries, nurses, bus drivers, janitors and computer technicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The support staff shrank from 59,384 full-time equivalent jobs in 2007-08 to 55,912 in 2013-14 - a loss of 3,472. About three-quarters of those jobs were in school transportation and maintenance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that while school jobs still are down from 2007-08, they do appear to be rebounding. As we&rsquo;ve said, there were 186,202 full-time equivalent jobs in 2013-14, the latest year available. That&rsquo;s slightly higher than the previous school year, when there were 185,944 positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a final note: McAuliffe, at this writing, has declined to reveal details about his education budget, other than to pledge significant new funding. He&rsquo;s scheduled to present his budget proposals to the General Assembly&rsquo;s money committees Dec. 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe told journalists, &quot;Since 2008, we have cut 5,000 positions&quot; in state public schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual number is 4,811, but we won&rsquo;t carp with the rounding up. In a similar statement on a radio show, the governor said &quot;about 5,000 jobs.&quot; It should be noted that about one-fourth of the positions belonged to instructors and that the vast majority of lost jobs affected support staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, we rate McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-12-08T08:46:07.133357", "ruling_date": "2015-12-08T08:45:44", "ruling_headline": "McAuliffe says 5,000 school jobs have been cut since 2008", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcauliffe-says-5000-school-jobs-cut-2008", "ruling_link_text": "Remains of recession", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Gov.
