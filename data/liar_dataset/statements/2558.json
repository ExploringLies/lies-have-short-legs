It might be Hank Gilbert, making his second hard charge for state agriculture commissioner versus Todd Staples, the Republican who topped him four years ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGilbert, ever prowling for issues, recently trumpeted that the Texas Department of Agriculture is looking at buying thousands of stress balls -- squeezable toys. He said in a Sept. 24 press release: &quot;Make no mistake, Texans love their balls: footballs, baseballs, basketballs, and soccer balls. But 300,000 stress balls? It seems a little extreme, but that&#39;s the quantity of grape, barbell, and book-shaped polyurethane stress balls the Texas Department of Agriculture could be spending taxpayer dollars on...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReally?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo our inquiry, Gilbert&#39;s campaign provided Web links to the agriculture agency&#39;s June request for bids as well as a September post on a state website indicating that a $99,000 contract to provide promotional materials was awarded to a Massachusetts company, <a href=\"http://oceanspromotions.logomall.com/\">Oceans Promotions</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe downloaded the June 29 bid-request package from a site for state requisitions overseen by the state comptroller&#39;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe package shows the department was seeking bids to provide up to 300,000 stress &quot;relievers,&quot; which we&#39;re guessing are not balls because they&#39;re not round.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrecisely, the package says, the agency sought bids to make &quot;promotional items with logo imprints to follow through on (the) TDA Food and Nutrition Texans Bring It Campaign,&quot; with the items to include grape-shaped stress relievers with &quot;Texans Bring It&quot; written on them or &quot;Eating Right,&quot; which would be made of polyurethane and be two inches high by three inches wide.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe package says a second set of stress relievers, each one called &quot;Dumbbell,&quot; would be imprinted &quot;Texans Bring It&quot; and &quot;Exercise&quot; and be five inches high by 1.8 inches in diameter. A third stress reliever would be imprinted &quot;Book&quot; and &quot;Texans Bring It,&quot; according to the bid package, while other promotional items would include pencils, buttons and bumperstickers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe package says the bids were sought for various quantities, starting from 2,500 and topping out at 100,000 each. It electronically links to a <a href=\"http://www.branders.com/product/promotional_items_Stress_Reliever_Grapes?prdid=73394\">Branders.com site</a> showing what the agency wanted the stress relievers to look like (our interpretation: bunches of purple grapes).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs all this a real deal?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo our inquiry, Bryan Black, Staples&#39; spokesman, replied via e-mail: &quot;An invitation for bid was issued for these federally funded educational items to reduce the $5.8 billion avoidable health care expenditures, paid by taxpayers, associated with overweight and obesity health problems.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe followed up with Black, asking if it&#39;s accurate to conclude that up to 300,000 of the stress relievers are being purchased. We also wondered why the purchase was being made. Black said he&#39;d limit his comment to his e-mailed statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSurely the agency would pipe up if Gilbert got its purchase plans wrong. We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-08T18:27:34.831744", "ruling_date": "2010-10-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hank Gilbert says Texas Department of Agriculture could be buying up to 300,000 stress balls", "ruling_headline_slug": "hank-gilbert-says-texas-department-agriculture-cou", "ruling_link_text": "Battle obesity, squeeze \"grapes\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/09302010_bryanblackresponsepftexas.html\">E-mail</a> and interview, Bryan Black, assistant commissioner for communications, Texas Department of Agriculture, Sept. 30, 2010 and Oct. 6, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Vince Leibowitz, campaign manager, Hank Gilbert campaign, Oct. 7, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas Comptroller of Public Accounts, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/06292010_tdainvitationbids,pdf\">bid solicitation package</a> and <a href=\"http://esbd.cpa.state.tx.us/award_show.cfm?proc_id=551-0-1335A%20DGG&amp;ag_num=551\">bid award</a>, June 29, 2010 and Sept. 23, 2010 (accessed Oct. 7, 2010)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Cattle raiser", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Hank", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 289, "last_name": "Gilbert", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "hank-gilbert", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Gilbertmug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/289/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://hankgilbert.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays the Texas Department of Agriculture seeks to purchase up to 300,000 promotional stress balls.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press release.", "statement_date": "2010-09-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
