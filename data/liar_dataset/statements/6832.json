Powell held Cantor responsible for fueling a budget impasse with Democrats in April 2011 that came within a day of shutting down the government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPowell was emotional when his chance came to ask Cantor a prepared question. &quot;This is for my son,&quot; he said. Powell&rsquo;s son is an Army major who has served in Afghanistan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen he turned to Cantor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Last year when you and the president were in a budget standoff that threatened to shut down the federal government, you voted to continue paying members of Congress, including yourself, in the event of a shutdown,&quot; Powell told the majority leader. &quot;At the same time, you voted against a bill which would have -- it would ensure -- that members of the armed services continue to get paid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My question is this, Eric: How could you in good conscience vote to continue your own pay but, at the same vote to stop paying our servicemen and women that you voted to send into combat in Afghanistan?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check Powell&rsquo;s facts, which Cantor said were wrong.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPowell&rsquo;s campaign backed the claim by pointing us to two procedural votes held during heated debates on spending. We&rsquo;ll take a look at each.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Military pay</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn April 7, 2011, President Barack Obama and Republican leaders were in tense budget negotiations one day before a government shutdown <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/us/politics/10budget.html\">deadline</a>. The GOP was demanding billions in spending cuts in return for passing an appropriations bill. Obama vowed to veto any legislation that contained what he said were harsh GOP demands for cuts in social programs and an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican-led House sought to ease the pressure that day by <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20051803-503544.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">proposing </a>a one-week appropriations bill. The legislation would have funded the Department of Defense for a longer time -- through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Republicans called the measure a &quot;troop funding bill.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats were not to be outdone. During floor debate, they said there was no guarantee Obama would sign the measure. Rep. Bill Owens, D-N.Y., offered an amendment that would ensure troops would continue to be paid if the government closed. Owens never explained how he expected to protect military pay by offering an amendment to a bill he said was likely to be vetoed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., denounced the motion as &quot;purely a political gesture.&quot; Rogers said the GOP bill, which he sponsored, already provided &quot;the essential funds for our men and women who are in harm&rsquo;s way.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h246\">voted </a>against Owens&rsquo; motion, along with all but one Republican. But he was in the 247-181 majority, including 15 Democrats, who <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll247.xml\">voted </a>for the underlying bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo did Cantor really vote against a bill that would have ensured troops get paid, as Powell said?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Congressional pay</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn April 1, 2011, House Republicans passed a bill directing that its version of budget become law if the Senate did not act on it by April 6. This appeared to <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/house_gop_tries_to_force_senates_hand_on_spending-204455-1.html\">violate </a>the U.S. Constitution, which says that both chambers must approve bills before they can become law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe measure included a provision that would deny pay to members of Congress and the president if a shutdown occurred. This was major public relations point because members of Congress <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/barbara-boxer/congress-cant-agree-cutting-its-own-pay-event-gove/\">get paid </a>during a shutdown, while most other federal employees do not. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/notes/justin-amash/statement-on-h-r-1255-government-shutdown-prevention-act/194387587267322\">Republicans </a>pointed out that, under the constitution, congressional pay cannot be reduced in the middle of a term. To allay concerns, other Republicans suggested they could be paid retroactively when the shutdown ended, like the rest of the federal workforce.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats upped the stakes, seeking an amendment that would bar retro payments to Congress. Then they got a surprise. Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., revealed an email he had received from Obama&rsquo;s Department of Justice questioning the constitutionality of the Democrats&rsquo; motion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe amendment was defeated on a partisan 236-187 <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll223.xml\">vote</a>. Cantor and all but one Republican voted against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor then voted for the underlying bill, which included the problematic ban on paying Congress during a shutdown. It passed the House but died in the Senate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth measures -- as dubious as they were -- were attempts to erase the pay protection for congress members in the event of a government shutdown. So to say Cantor was out to protect his paycheck is a big stretch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>A final note</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic amendments at issue were &quot;motions to recommit,&quot; a prerogative of the minority party since the 1st Congress. They are motions, often procedural, to send a bill back to a committee just before a floor vote on passage of the legislation is held. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-duffy-voted-against-pay-incr/\">Both parties</a>, when in the minority, have these motions to &quot;make political statements and try to embarrass the majority for partisan advantage,&quot; according to David Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules and former Republican staffer on the House Rules Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPowell said that Cantor, during the threat of a government shutdown last year, voted to ensure Congress would continue to be paid and against offering the same protection to members of the military.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Powell got it backwards. Cantor, during a period of high political gamesmanship, supported Republican legislation that, in the event of shutdown, would have continued military pay and withheld paychecks for Congress members. He simply opposed two procedural efforts by Democrats that would have given them some bragging rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPowell&rsquo;s charge was not off-the-cuff. It came during a portion of a debate when he got to ask Cantor a direct question. Powell, in comments leading up to his query, said he&rsquo;d given plenty of thought to what he&rsquo;d ask. That suggests he had time to check all the facts. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPowell should take heat for ridiculously distorting Cantor&rsquo;s votes. So we give his statement our lowest rating -- Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-04T00:05:46.789586", "ruling_date": "2012-10-04T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wayne Powell says Eric Cantor voted to protect his pay and against guaranteeing pay to troops ", "ruling_headline_slug": "wayne-powell-says-eric-cantor-voted-protect-his-pa", "ruling_link_text": "Huge distortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tC-Span.org, <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Virginia7\">Virginia 7th Congressional District Debate</a>, Powell&rsquo;s question at 38:25, Oct. 1, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from Rob Eberhardt on behalf of the Powell campaign, Oct. 2, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20051803-503544.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">House passes one-week budget bill;
