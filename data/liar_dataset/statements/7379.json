It found 92 percent support for background checks for all gun buyers, which the Quinnipiac pollsters described as &quot;overwhelming.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; It found 91 percent support for universal background checks among voters in a household with a gun.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther polls we&rsquo;ve cited in recent fact-checks also found high percentages of support for universal background checks, even among gun owners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/01/14/in-gun-control-debate-several-options-draw-majority-support/1/\">Pew Research Center</a> poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of gun owners) favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-34222_162-57564386-10391739/9-in-10-back-universal-gun-background-checks/\">CBS/New York Times</a> poll conducted Jan. 11-15 among 1,110 adults showed that 92 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member) support universal background checks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama did cherry-pick the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/wh_now_is_the_time_full.pdf\">gun-control proposal</a> on which consensus is strongest -- background checks. Other proposals he might also call &quot;common-sense,&quot; such as bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, held 56 percent support in the Quinnipiac poll. And they were narrowly opposed by voters in households with a gun, with 52 percent against such measures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama said &quot;overwhelming majorities of Americans&quot; support gun legislation &quot;like background checks.&quot; The poll cited by the administration, as well as other independent polls in 2013, do show support for universal background checks above 80 percent among voters, even those who own guns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut people would get the impression from Obama&#39;s statement that there is similar support for other White House gun proposals, when the reality is weaker majority support among voters and slim opposition among gun owners.
