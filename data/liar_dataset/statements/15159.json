He was transferred there in April 2017 following his federal death sentence, according to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-moved-death-row-terre-haute-federal-n749671\">news reports</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GxQbfPUbNbOYT8ianftn5qLE4qMW0EzBEIcc5o3G9RhUBhspvO4A8kOzQAPsDpG7hHhcldBSfysK9E9gXigLVTIzSETD_lLRkCqZ5Ob8iv3FpVOun_ostHHP0OwKr3Sw2NXbTIZr\" style=\"border:none; height:259px; width:604px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other issues abound in this fake item. The fake post purports to link a to a video &mdash; but no such video exists on the site. The headline also misstates the number of victims. (Roof killed nine parishioners, not 14.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar fake news item was debunked by our friends at <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/charleston-church-shooter-dylann-roof-raped-cell/\">Snopes</a> in 2016. Snopes reported that the phony conspiracy theory about Roof being raped in prison originated in July 2015 on the fake news website NYMeta, and has continued in various forms and outlets since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a couple possible reasons why this hoax persists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, the idea of retribution against Roof may appeal to readers&rsquo; desire for justice for one of the deadliest hate crimes in U.S. history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story&rsquo;s staying power may also have something to do with the fact it shares some similarities to an actual news story, albeit one with important differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2016, Roof was <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/church_shooting/report-dylann-roof-attacker-s-jail-cell-was-unlocked-for/article_39d5ee4c-e709-11e6-b4ac-b32a5368e884.html\">reportedly</a> beaten while being held at the Charleston County jail. The assault &quot;left Roof with minor bruises,&quot; but there is no evidence that the mass shooter was the victim of sexual assault.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake news item also claims Roof was assaulted while being escorted to the shower unit. However, the assault against him in August 2016 occurred after an unlocked cell door allowed an inmate to approach Roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers said Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was raped and beaten in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of factual errors with this story. Roof has not been housed in Charleston &mdash; where the purported assault happened &mdash; since April 2017. The item also misstates the number of parishoners Roof killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being previously debunked, this hoax continues to persist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-03-20T11:08:10.388674", "ruling_date": "2018-03-20T11:21:05", "ruling_headline": "No evidence Charleston shooter Dylann Roof raped, beaten in prison", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-evidence-charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-raped-b", "ruling_link_text": "Previously debunked, still making the rounds", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-moved-death-row-terre-haute-federal-n749671\">Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison</a>,&quot; April 22, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/charleston-church-shooter-dylann-roof-raped-cell/\">Broken Roof</a>,&quot; Dec. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charleston Post and Courier, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/church_shooting/report-dylann-roof-attacker-s-jail-cell-was-unlocked-for/article_39d5ee4c-e709-11e6-b4ac-b32a5368e884.html\">Report: Dylann Roof attacker&#39;s jail cell was unlocked for 12 hours; no formal reprimands given</a>,&quot; Feb. 4, 2017</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Say Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was raped and beaten in prison.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a blog", "statement_date": "2018-03-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
