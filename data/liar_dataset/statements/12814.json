She negotiated the first agreement ever &mdash; ever &mdash; where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Bill Clinton&rsquo;s claim is largely accurate, he&rsquo;s offering a rosy spin on the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, which was at the time and continues to be widely panned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton did play a key -- but not solo -- role in the talks with China and India, and it was the first time the two countries made emissions reduction pledges in an international agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unlike the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 or Paris Agreement of 2015, the accord wasn&rsquo;t actually an official agreement. It wasn&rsquo;t &quot;adopted&quot; by signatories, but merely &quot;<a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20091219/conference-parties-takes-note-copenhagen-accord\">taken note of</a>&quot; (in other words, they formally recognized the accord&rsquo;s existence).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the &quot;agreement&quot; was non-binding and the countries set their own voluntary targets, leading some environmentalists and experts to cast it aside as essentially meaningless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Copenhagen, China and India had both <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/items/2613.php\">signed and ratified</a> the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States backed out of. But because they were developing countries, they were not required to curb their carbon emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/19/china.usnews\">overtaking</a> the United States as the world&rsquo;s biggest carbon emitter, China released its first <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/english/environment/213624.htm#11\">national climate change program</a> and said it would reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by 2010 and &quot;consequently reduce CO2 emissions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, India released a <a href=\"http://www.moef.nic.in/sites/default/files/Pg01-52_2.pdf\">national action plan on climate change</a> in 2008, in which it didn&rsquo;t commit to reducing emissions but laid out steps that would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until Copenhagen that the two countries finally committed to reducing carbon emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this sense, the accord &quot;played a major role in breaking&quot; the &quot;firewall&quot; between developed countries and developing countries when it came to climate action responsibility, according to &nbsp;David Ciplet, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who wrote Power in a Warming World: The New Global Politics of Climate Change and the Remaking of Environmental Inequality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;However, whether the Copenhagen Accord was a positive development overall is definitely controversial,&quot; Ciplet told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, like her husband, Hillary Clinton often touts the accord as one of her major climate change accomplishments, referring to it as a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/03/06/clinton-will-tackle-climate-change-as-president/\">key diplomatic breakthrough</a>&quot; on her campaign website and recounting how she and Obama were &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/03/06/clinton-will-tackle-climate-change-as-president/\">hunting down the Chinese</a>&quot; to get them to the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She devotes a significant chunk of a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=XJDHAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hard+choices&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU7o6yypTOAhWKuB4KHeXMC6MQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22We%27re%20All%20In%20This%20Together%22&amp;f=false\">chapter</a> in her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, to the talks. She notes the role of Todd Stern, a key negotiator, as well as her and Obama&rsquo;s famous tag-team chase to find the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiaobao during the talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In a makeshift conference room whose glass walls had been covered by drapes for privacy against prying eyes, we found Wen wedged around a long table with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and South African President Jacob Zuma. Jaws dropped when they saw us. &#39;Are you ready?&#39; said President Obama, flashing a big grin,&quot; Clinton <a href=\"http://www.firstpost.com/world/how-obama-clinton-crashed-a-secret-meet-between-china-india-1565611.html?utm_source=ref_article\">writes</a>. &quot;Now the real negotiations could begin. It was a moment that was at least a year in the making.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But according to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/science/earth/20accord.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">news</a> <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-copenhagen-protocol-how-china-and-india-sabotaged-the-un-climate-summit-a-692861-3.html\">reports</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-copenhagen-instantview-idUSTRE5BH4VN20091218\">world leaders</a>, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-statement-on-the-co/\">environmental</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/20/hillary-clinton-white-house-climate-change\">activists</a> and experts, the &quot;real negotiations&quot; didn&rsquo;t actually lead to anything with teeth. China and India did end up agreeing to reduce their emissions and set their own targets, but emphasized the pledge was not legally binding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This basically changed the international approach to climate action from Kyoto Protocol, which had a compliance mechanism, to &quot;a voluntary approach where countries are free to determine unilaterally what forms of action they would like to commit to,&quot; said Ciplet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Many, including myself, saw this as a much weaker mitigation framework than a robust second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol,&quot; he said, adding that even after the Paris Agreement, &quot;we are still not on track&quot; in mitigating climate change. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton &quot;negotiated the first agreement &mdash; ever &mdash; where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton was at the table at the Copenhagen Accord, though she wasn&rsquo;t the only U.S. official present.
