These totals, too, are more than Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, just because some candidates won by larger margins doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean Trump didn&rsquo;t win in a landslide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we consulted 10 experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other views</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One said it was close to a landslide, but none said Trump had crossed the threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.costaspanagopoulos.com/about.html\">Costas Panagopoulos</a>, director of the Center for Electoral Politics and Democracy at Fordham University, said Trump&rsquo;s winning 57 percent of the Electoral College vote makes it &quot;pretty close&quot; to a landslide. He said 60 percent is generally considered to be a landslide, at least when it comes to the popular vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the others all said Trump fell short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taegan Goddard, founder of <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/\">Political Wire</a>, said the threshold should be 400 electoral votes. He said that was a figure often cited, prior to the election, when there were predictions of a Clinton landslide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/alex-keyssar\">Alex Keyssar</a>, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard&rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government, went much lower -- 330 -- though still above what Trump has earned. Keyssar, former chairman of the Social Science Research Council&#39;s National Research Commission on Voting and Elections, acknowledged the figure is &quot;pure impression.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political scientist <a href=\"https://www.polisci.wisc.edu/people/person.aspx?id=1041\">Barry Burden</a>, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the Trump margin comes up short in another way. From 1952 to 2012, the winning candidate got an average of 73 percent of the electoral votes, well above Trump&rsquo;s 57 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Losing the popular vote also takes the shine off any Electoral College victory,&quot; Burden added, a point echoed by <a href=\"https://polisci.osu.edu/people/asher.1\">Herb Asher</a>, a political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also voting no on landslide were <a href=\"http://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/people/john-t-woolley\">John Woolley</a>, a University of California, Santa Barbara political science professor and co-founder of the American Presidency Project; and <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/staff_sabato.html\">Larry Sabato</a>, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Sabato also runs <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/about/\">Sabato&rsquo;s Crystal Ball</a>, an election analysis website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Calling a 306 electoral-vote victory a &lsquo;landslide&rsquo; is ridiculous,&quot; Sabato told us. &quot;Trump&rsquo;s Electoral College majority is actually similar to John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s 303 in 1960 and Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s 297 in 1976. Has either of those victories ever been called a landslide? Of course not &mdash; and JFK and Carter actually won the popular vote narrowly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Added Boston University history professor <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/history/faculty/bruce-j-schulman/\">Bruce Schulman</a> : &quot;To say that Trump won by a landslide, then Obama won by even bigger landslides.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the narrower of Obama&rsquo;s two wins -- in 2012 with 332 electoral votes -- was described at the time as not being a landslide by The Atlantic, Politico, conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg, Fox News&rsquo; Brit Hume and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Priebus said Trump&rsquo;s win was &quot;an electoral landslide.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But aside from the fact Trump lost the popular vote, his margin in the Electoral College isn&rsquo;t all that high, either. None of the 10 experts we contacted said Trump&rsquo;s win crosses that threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Priebus&rsquo; claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-18T11:36:28.476519", "ruling_date": "2016-11-21T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Despite losing popular vote, Donald Trump won in 'electoral landslide,' GOP's Reince Priebus says", "ruling_headline_slug": "despite-losing-popular-vote-donald-trump-won-elect", "ruling_link_text": "Experts: Electoral College margin not overwhelming", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21FRiYIGyMs\">&quot;Good Morning America&quot;
