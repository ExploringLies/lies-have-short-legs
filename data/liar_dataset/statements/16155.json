Spanberger had raised $4.5 million through Sept. 25, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commision. That was nearly double the $2.3 million raised by Brat - or a $2.2 million difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brat says Soros organizations are responsible for the difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She got $2.2 million from ActBlue,&quot; Brat said during an Oct. 21 <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/22/exclusive-dave-brat-millions-in-soros-resistance-money-trying-to-defeat-my-independent-voice/\">interview</a> on Breitbart News Sunday. &quot;Your audience probably knows who they are, right? But that is the George Soros resistance group. That&rsquo;s not even mainstream Democrat. That&rsquo;s the group that&rsquo;s doing the riots in Portland, that&rsquo;s promoting violence and mobs instead of jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;...Abigail Spanberger is getting $2.2 million from the Soros-linked resist movement - ActBlue,&quot; Brat&nbsp;said during an Oct. 22 interview on the John Frederick Show in Portsmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She raised $3 million in the last three months, which is unheard of, from (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi and ActBlue, which is a George Soros-backed group,&quot; Brat said during an Oct. 16 <a href=\"https://newsradiowrva.radio.com/media/audio-channel/brat-and-spanberger-battle-congressional-debate\">interview</a> on News Radio WRVA in Richmond. &quot;It&rsquo;s her largest bundler which raises money, and that is the group that is behind the resistance movement across the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros has been&nbsp;high in the news lately. Some conservatives - including religious broadcaster<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/pat-robertson-accuses-george-soros-financing-migrant-caravan-1183705\"> Pat Roberston</a> of Virginia Beach - have accused Soros of&nbsp;funding the migrant caravan from the Honduras to the United States - &nbsp;a charge the billionaire says is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenSociety/status/1053032364903985152\">false</a> and for which <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/26/blog-posting/bloggers-trump-gaetz-offer-no-evidence-caravan-was/\">no supporting evidence</a> has emerged. And on Oct. 22, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/nyregion/soros-caravan-explosive-bomb-home.html\">pipe bomb</a> was found in the mailbox of Soros&rsquo; home near New York City - one of at least 14 explosives that had been mailed in late October to critics of President Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Brat is right in claiming Spanberger&rsquo;s campaign has received $2.2 million from a Soros-controlled group called ActBlue. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is ActBlue?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ActBlue is a nonprofit organization that provides a software platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns through personal computers and cell phones. If you donate to a Democratic candidate on his or her website, there&rsquo;s a good chance that ActBlue is the conduit that sends your money to the campaign - much like PayPal is the conduit for many online purchases. Since its inception in 2005, ActBlue <a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/about\">says</a> it has funneled $3 billion to Democratic candidates and &quot;progressive&quot; causes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/spanberger_website?refcode=menu\">Spanberger uses ActBlue</a>, and has received several thousand individual contributions through the platform. They totaled almost $2.2 million through Sept. 25, which was the most current FEC reporting date available when Brat made his statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros is among <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/us/money-politics-dean-phillips.html\">millions</a> of people who have made contributions through ActBlue, according to Chris Fleming, spokesman for the nonprofit. &quot;Soros has given through ActBlue, not to ActBlue,&quot; Fleming said. &quot;Anyone can give through ActBlue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fleming declined give the sum of Soros&#39; donations to candidates through ActBlue. But he emphasized that Soros does not financially support ActBlue nor play a role in its operations. &quot;ActBlue is in no way related to George Soros,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros has not personally given money to Spanberger&rsquo;s campaign or to any Democrat running for Congress during this two-year election cycle, according to FEC records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brat&rsquo;s explanation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Brat&rsquo;s campaign for proof of the candidate&rsquo;s claim that ActBlue &quot;is the George Soros resistance group.&quot; Katey Price, Brat&rsquo;s campaign spokesperson, sent&nbsp;an article from USA Today and blogs from two conservative websites: Human Events and The Daily Signal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 20, 2017, USA Today ran a story <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/20/george-soros-democracy-alliance-anti-trump-activists-meeting/99417808/\">headlined</a>, &quot;George Soros-aligned group weighs funding anti-Trump activists.&quot; The <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/20/george-soros-democracy-alliance-anti-trump-activists-meeting/99417808/\">article</a> reported that Indivisible - a group seeking to build &quot;resistance&quot; to President Donald Trump&rsquo;s agenda - was seeking support (successfully, it turns out) from the Democracy Alliance, an activist organization Soros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/democrats-resistance-fundraising.html\">helped found</a> in 2005 that raises money through ActBlue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daily Signal - on Feb. 10, 2017 - <a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/02/10/indivisible-with-ties-to-george-soros-sows-division-against-trump-gop-lawmakers/\">reported</a> that one member of Indivisible&rsquo;s board of directors had previously worked for a Soros-funded group, and another member is now employed by an organization that has received money from the billionaire. That shows, according to the blog, that Soros has &quot;loose ties&quot; to Indivisible. ActBlue, the blog says &quot;raises money&quot; for Indivisible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human Events - on July 7, 2009 - <a href=\"http://humanevents.com/2009/07/07/the-actbluesoros-complex/\">called</a> ActBlue a mouthpiece &quot;for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor.&quot; As proof, it wrote that &quot;Soros directly donated $6,900 to ActBlue on May 11, 2008.&quot; Fleming said this is wrong; Soros contributed the sum &quot;through&quot; ActBlue to Scott Kleeb, a Nebraska Democrat who was running for the U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brat says of Spanberger, &quot;She got $2.2 million for ActBlue...That is the George Soros resistance group.&quot; Brat is implausibly positioning Soros, the focus of many conservative theorists, as the power behind Spanberger&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ActBlue is not a Soros-controlled organization. It&rsquo;s a nonprofit group that provides a software platform that allows people to contribute to Democratic candidates and causes through their personal computers and cell phones. ActBlue is a conduit; it does not raise political money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of Sept. 25, Spanberger had raised almost $2.2 million through ActBlue. The money came for from several thousand individuals, not Soros. Brat&rsquo;s attempts to tie Soros to ActBlue and, therefore, Spanberger&rsquo;s campaign - sometimes through third or fourth-hand links - is contrived and deceptive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Brat&rsquo;s statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-01T17:54:57.200952", "ruling_date": "2018-11-02T01:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Dave Brat's linkage of George Soros to Abigail Spanberger gets Pants on Fire ", "ruling_headline_slug": "dave-brats-linkage-george-soros-abigail-spanberger", "ruling_link_text": "\"Six degrees of separation\" theory ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Federal Election Commission, Dave Brat&rsquo;s campaign finance reports, Jan. 1, 2017 - Sept. 30, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FEC, Abigail &nbsp;Spanberger&rsquo;s campaign finance reports, June 20, 2017 - Sept. 30, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FEC, Individual contributors to campaigns, accessed Nov. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dave Brat, <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/22/exclusive-dave-brat-millions-in-soros-resistance-money-trying-to-defeat-my-independent-voice/\">Radio interview on Breitbart News Sunday</a>, Oct. 21, 2018 (2:50 mark).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brat, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xouLT9qXLc\">interview on the John Frederick Show</a>, Oct. 22, 2018 (8:55 mark).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brat, <a href=\"https://newsradiowrva.radio.com/media/audio-channel/brat-and-spanberger-battle-congressional-debate\">radio Interview on The Jeff Katz Show</a>, WRVA, Oct. 16, 2018 (8:17 mark).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Society, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/pat-robertson-accuses-george-soros-financing-migrant-caravan-1183705\">Tweet</a>, Oct. 17, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsweek, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/pat-robertson-accuses-george-soros-financing-migrant-caravan-1183705\">Pat Robertson accused George Soros of &lsquo;financing migrant caravan&hellip;</a>&quot;
