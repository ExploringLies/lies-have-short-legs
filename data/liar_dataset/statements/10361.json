The headline on a Georgia Farm Bureau web page touts, &quot;Georgia Agriculture &ndash; The state&rsquo;s $71 billion industry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bullet point underneath is a bit more nuanced. &quot;Agriculture contributes more than $71.1 billion annually to Georgia&#39;s economy,&quot; it reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distinction matters, as we&rsquo;ll get to in a minute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before we get into semantics, we have to delve into some economics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted the farm bureau, which directed us to the 2013 Ag Snapshot published by the Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development at the University of Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center conducts an annual survey which allows farmers to report acreage, yield, crop price and other details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2013 report &ndash; which looks at 82 commodities using 2011 data &ndash; concludes the direct economic value of agriculture is $13 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two pages later, it concludes that direct value, combined with the values along the supply chain from fertilizer and seed to first-line processing plants, &quot;generated a total economic impact of $71.1 billion&quot; for Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center officials told us they add to the the $13 billion what the actual economic value (using federal data compiled by a private firm) of the businesses along the ag supply chain. In 2011, the tally was $44 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It then induces a multiplier, adding in what workers in all of those jobs spend on daily living, to arrive at the $71 billion figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are looking at the contribution of all the sectors related to agriculture,&quot; said center economist Sharon Kane. &quot;It&rsquo;s so much more meaningful to report the overall impact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMPLAN Group LLC, the North Carolina firm that operates the input-output modeling system and provides the figures for ag-related sectors, did not return calls to confirm data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to try to verify the agriculture numbers. It couldn&rsquo;t, exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency&rsquo;s Economic Research Service division can offer only somewhat comparable data in its Farm Income and Wealth Statistics tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to that division, Georgia&rsquo;s net valued added by farms in 2011 was $2.9 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a huge difference from between the $13 billion that farmers reported. Definitions account for part of the gap &ndash; Georgia counts timber, nurseries and agriculture tourism such as hunting licenses, while the federal agency does not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even then, there is at least a $9 billion gap between state and federal figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make sense of that gap, and the calculations themselves, PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Bruce Seaman, an economist who studies economic impacts of projects and industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seaman, a professor of economics at Georgia State University, said the varying definitions of agriculture likely accounts for much of the massive gap in the figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More concerning, he said, is the mixing of &quot;impact&quot; and &quot;contribution&quot; when throwing around the $71 billion figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agribusiness report answers the question of how much activity is going on in agriculture and its related industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is the industry contribution, Seaman said. It is a snapshot of the industry, which shows agriculture makes up about 10 percent of the overall state economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s very different than saying it has the same impact, or importance, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider: &nbsp;In 1905, about a third of all jobs in the United States were in agriculture. But Seaman said that did not mean those jobs had a proportional impact on the overall economy, or the United States would have collapsed as jobs moved into manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It describes how much activity is linked to an industry,&quot; he said. &quot;But it does not mean that if the agriculture industry declined by half, the economy would suffer a $35 or $36 billion loss.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, looking at the big picture, is agriculture Georgia&rsquo;s largest industry?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of it as a pie (pecan, of course. Made in Georgia).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the state and federal data &ndash; and adding in sectors that are directly linked to growing cotton and raising broilers &ndash; the $71 billion figure might be a bit too high, but can be mostly verified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that figure is simply agriculture&rsquo;s slice of the pie that is Georgia&rsquo;s economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this study, making ag&rsquo;s slice smaller or larger doesn&rsquo;t make the pie any bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agriculture is the largest single component in the state economy. But it requires another type of study to know its actual economic impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Georgia Farm Bureau statement<strong> </strong>is accurate, but needs some additional context to fully understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-01-08T15:26:47.781860", "ruling_date": "2015-01-09T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Does agriculture contribute $71 billion to Georgia's economy?", "ruling_headline_slug": "71-billion-question-what-value-or-impact-agricultu", "ruling_link_text": "Estimate needs some tending", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Georgia Farm Bureau. <a href=\"http://www.gfb.org/aboutus/georgia_agriculture.html\"><strong>About Georgia Agriculture</strong></a> page, accessed Dec. 30, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Georgia, Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development, <a href=\"http://www.caes.uga.edu/center/caed/pubs/agsnapshots/documents/2013AGsnaphots_final.pdf\"><strong>2013 Ag Snapshot</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <strong><a href=\"http://www.census.gov/econ/cbp/\">County Business Patterns</a></strong>, Georgia counties, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, <strong><a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/farm-income-and-wealth-statistics/value-added-years-by-state.aspx#.VKv7h8lImew\">Farm and Wealth Statistics, Value Added</a></strong> table</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2012 <a href=\"http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_1_State_Level/Georgia/st13_1_002_002.pdf\"><strong>Agriculture Census</strong></a>, Georgia data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Chris McGath, agricultural economist,<a href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> Economic Research Service</a> unit at USDA, Dec. 30, 201</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview, Kent Wolfe, director, Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development at University of Georgia, Jan. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone &nbsp;and email interviews, Sharon Kane, public service associate/economist, Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development at University of Georgia, Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email interviews, Bruce Seaman, professor of economics, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies of at Georgia State University, Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sue King, spokeswoman for the National Agriculture Statistical Services unit at the USDA, Dec. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jennifer Whittaker, spokeswoman, Georgia Farm Bureau, Dec. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email and phone interview with Robert Bernstein, spokesman, U.S. Census Bureau, Dec. 29, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 3030, "last_name": "Georgia Farm Bureau", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "georgia-farm-bureau", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/independentgroupMug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3030/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Agriculture contributes $71 billion to Georgia&rsquo;s economy annually, making it the state&rsquo;s largest industry.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a statement on the Georgia Farm Bureau website", "statement_date": "2015-01-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 122, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/122/", "subject": "Agriculture", "subject_slug": "agriculture", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
