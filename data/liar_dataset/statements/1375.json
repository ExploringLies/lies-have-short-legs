And I'm going to have to campaign very, very hard. ... For instance, I haven't missed a vote since 1993. I hope I don't have to miss any votes this year because of a campaign.\"  <br /> &nbsp;  <br /> Has Grassley really been so steadfast? We had to limit our investigation to roll call votes; in the Senate, less controversial bills or amendments are frequently adopted by unanimous consent or by voice vote, meaning members simply say \"aye\" or \"nay.\"  <br /> &nbsp;  <br /> First, we turned to  <em> Congressional Quarterly </em> , a publication that annually studies lawmakers' voting records. According to  <em> CQ </em> 's Web site, Grassley has had a flawless voting record since 1993. The  <em> Washington Post </em> <a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/g000386/votes/missed/\" target=\"_blank\"> also compiles </a> similar information, and we found that Grassley hasn't been absent for a vote since he missed four votes on July 14, 1993. (Those votes pertained to a bill that would allow federal employees to participate in the political process so long as it was done outside of work.)  <br /> &nbsp;  <br /> What kept Grassley from the Senate floor that day in 1993? Flooding in Iowa, according to the  <em> Des Moines Register</em>, noting that the senator has become \"the iron man of the Senate racking up ... 5,700 consecutive votes.\"  <br /> &nbsp;  <br /> Indeed, as an average, Grassley has voted about 99.6 percent of the time since he took office in 1981. Other senators elected at the same time cannot tout such near-perfect records. For example, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has, on average, voted 93 percent of the time in the last 28 years, first as a Republican then as a Democrat. And Sen. Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, has voted on average about 90.7 percent of the time.  <br /> &nbsp;  <br /> Grassley has gone to great lengths to maintain his record. When, for example, a blizzard threatened Washington, D.C., on the eve of a crucial health care overhaul vote on Dec. 19, 2009, Grassley spent the night in his office to make sure he didn't miss it.  <br /> &nbsp;  <br /> \"Bc of potential blizzard I've come to office to sleep,\"  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ChuckGrassley\" target=\"_blank\"> he Tweeted </a> the night of the 18th. \"Vote at 720am vote Sat. Hv not missed vote 7/93. 5700 votes consecutive.\"  <br /> &nbsp;  <br /> Grassley said he hadn't missed a vote since 1993, which is certainly correct for every recorded vote. Grassley has every right to brag.
