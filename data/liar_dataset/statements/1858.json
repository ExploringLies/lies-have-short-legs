DeKalb based its comparison on  6,000 gallons a month. That's the average amount of water homeowners  use each month, officials in several areas said. The monthly bill for  DeKalb customers who use 6,000 gallons a month is $51.34, county  officials said.<br /><br />DeKalb's chart shows the county with about the  lowest water and sewer rates among metro counties and Atlanta. <br /><br />So  was DeKalb right?<br /><br />We first focused on six of the largest water  systems in the metro area: Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett  counties and the city of Atlanta. DeKalb is the state's  third-highest-populated county. Its Watershed Management Department has a  $227 million annual budget, which ranks among the highest in the state.<br /><br />Atlanta's  rates were the highest, more than twice the monthly cost of those in  DeKalb County. The city approved two sets of rate increases in the past  decade to help fund its ongoing $4 billion effort to overhaul its sewer  system and improve water quality. The average monthly cost is nearly  $121. (Brace yourselves, Atlanta homeowners, the monthly rate is  scheduled to rise by an additional 12 percent on July 1.) City officials  say Atlanta's rates may be the highest in the nation.<br /><br />The other  water systems were more in line with DeKalb. They ranged from Cobb's  $53.88 a month to Gwinnett's $69.44 monthly charge for the average  customer.<br /><br />We also checked with 10 water and sewer systems in  smaller cities and counties that DeKalb used to base its report. Most of  them range between $65 to $70 a month. The average monthly charge in  Walton County is $44.85, but it doesn't charge for sewer service.<br /><br />Again,  the reason DeKalb wants to increase the rates is because its system is  getting old. DeKalb's population grew faster than many of its neighbors,  thus its infrastructure has more wear and tear. The county has a $1.79  billion repair list. Could that be why DeKalb's rates are lower?<br /><br />Perhaps,  said Sally Bethea, executive director of the Upper Chattahoochee  Riverkeeper, a group that has monitored Atlanta's efforts to fix its  sewer system.<br /><br />\"They may have not yet made the kinds of  investments Atlanta has made,\" she said.<br /><br />If you focus solely on  the larger counties or all 16 governments that DeKalb studied, the  numbers do show DeKalb's rates for the average customer are below the  metro average. We rate the county's claim as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-04T15:07:25.694960", "ruling_date": "2010-06-04T20:21:53", "ruling_headline": "DeKalb water bills inexpensive in comparison to region", "ruling_headline_slug": "dekalb-water-bills-inexpensive-comparison-region", "ruling_link_text": "DeKalb homeowners aren't sinking in high water bills.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>DeKalb County Department of Watershed Management Five-Year  Financial Plan, May 18, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone interview, Jennifer  Carliie, Atlanta Watershed Management Department, May 21, 2010.<br /><br />Bartow  County Water &amp; Sewer Department Monthly Billing Chart - 2010.<br /><br />E-mail  from Tom Heard, general manager, Cherokee County Water &amp; Sewerage  Authority, May 21, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone interview, Cobb County  government spokesman Robert Quigley, May 21, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone  interview, Suzanne Brown, Clayton County Water Authority, May 21, 2010.<br /><br />E-mail  from Douglasville-Douglas County Water &amp; Sewer Authority, June 4,  2010.<br /><br />Telephone interview with Fayette County government, June 4,  2010.<br /><br />E-mail from Angela Parker, Fulton County government, May  21, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone interview with Tim Perkins, Forsyth County  Water &amp; Sewer Department Director, June 4, 2010.<br /><br />City of  Gainesville Water and Sanitary Sewer Rates and Policies - January 2010.<br /><br />E-mail  from Heather Sawyer, spokeswoman, Gwinnett County government, May 21,  2010.<br /><br />Paulding County Water System schedule of fees - 2010.<br /><br />Telephone  message, Walton County government, June 4, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone  interview, Sally Bethea, May 21,2010.</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Francis", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 439, "last_name": "Kung'u", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "francis-kungu", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Francis_Kungu__.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/439/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\"For now, we are still below average in the metro region.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a presentation", "statement_date": "2010-05-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Francis", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 439, "last_name": "Kung'u", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "francis-kungu", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Francis_Kungu__.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/439/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
