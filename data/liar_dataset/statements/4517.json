Rick Perry stated that in 2001, only four Texas legislators voted against the measure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe statement came as Perry apologized in a Sept. 28, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/RickPerry-immigration-heartless-education/2011/09/28/id/412594\">interview</a> with Newsmax TV for saying anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not &quot;have a heart&quot; &mdash; a comment he made in the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn an <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/RickPerry-immigration-heartless-education/2011/09/28/id/412594\">article about the interview</a>, though, Newsmax noted that Perry stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one. &quot;I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word, and it was inappropriate,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRLjkpYMB_U\">Perry was quoted as saying</a>. &quot;In Texas, in 2001, we had 181 members of the Legislature &mdash; only four voted against this piece of legislation &mdash; because it wasn&#39;t about immigration, it was about education.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnly four of the 181 members voted no?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve written other items about this law in recent days, so our interest was piqued. (We checked statements about whether <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/22/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-rick-perry-provided-state-colle/\">Perry gave illegal immigrants in-state rates</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-says-illegal-immigrants-get-10000/\">the difference in dollars between in-state and out-of-state tuition</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the journals for the 2001 session kept by the Texas House and Senate, Perry is darned close.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVersions of the proposal cleared House and Senate education panels with no opposition. The House <a href=\"http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/HouseJournals/77/day57.pdf\">passed the measure 142-1</a>, with Rep. Will Hartnett, R-Dallas, being the lone &quot;no&quot; vote; five House members were absent, according to the April 23, 2001, House Journal entry.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter amending the bill, the Senate <a href=\"http://www.journals.senate.state.tx.us/sjrnl/77r/html/5-21.htm\">approved it 27-3</a> on May 21, 2001, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThree days later, the House <a href=\"http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/HouseJournals/77/day81.pdf\">approved</a> the Senate&#39;s changes 130-2; the &quot;no&quot; voters were Hartnett and Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson. Sixteen members were not present.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry signed the measure into law June 16, 2001.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur count: Five of the 181 legislators referred to by Perry (31 state senators, 150 House members) voted against the tuition legislation.
