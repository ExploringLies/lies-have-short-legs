Chris Christie&rsquo;s &quot;Jersey Comeback.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his May 28 column, Krugman chastised the Republican governor as a &quot;fiscal phony,&quot; suggesting that Christie&rsquo;s comeback message is at odds with job growth in New Jersey since he took office in January 2010.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the liberal columnist, &quot;there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;re not sure if that &quot;McMansion&quot; nickname will stick, but as for job growth, Krugman&rsquo;s analysis is spot on, PolitiFact New Jersey found.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey&rsquo;s growth since the beginning of Christie&rsquo;s tenure has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChristie spokesman Michael Drewniak argued that the state&rsquo;s &quot;economic policies have us headed very much in the right direction in terms of job growth.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrewniak added, &quot;Do keep in mind that it was under this Governor that New Jersey had the best single year of private sector job growth in the last 10 years. That&rsquo;s over 71,000 private sector jobs created since the Governor took office.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, let&rsquo;s talk about total job growth, including public- and private-sector employment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs with previous stories, there&rsquo;s two ways of analyzing job growth figures: the net increase in jobs and the percentage increase. Our analysis is focused on the percentage increase, because that metric accounts for the differences in size between New Jersey and the other two states and the nation as a whole.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile New Jersey&rsquo;s total jobs grew by 37,100, or roughly 1 percent, between January 2010 and April 2012, New York increased its total jobs by 298,700, or about 3.5 percent, and Connecticut saw growth of 33,500, or about 2.1 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of April, there were 132,989,000 total jobs in the nation as a whole, representing a roughly 2.9 percent increase since January 2010. The April figures for the nation and the states are preliminary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLooking at total job growth since February 2010 -- Christie&rsquo;s first full month in office -- we found similar results.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetween February 2010 and April 2012, the nation saw an increase in total jobs of about 2.9 percent. During the same time period, New York and Connecticut increased total jobs by about 3.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, New Jersey&rsquo;s total job growth was about 1.2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following chart lays out the changes in total job growth as of April 2012:</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"height:208px; width:608px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">Net Total Job Growth Since Jan. 2010</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">% Total Job Growth Since Jan. 2010</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">Net Total Job Growth Since Feb. 2010</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">% Total Job Growth Since Feb. 2010</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">New Jersey</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">37,100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">1%</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">45,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">1.2%</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">New York</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">298,700</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">3.5%</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">296,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">3.5%</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">Connecticut</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">33,500</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">2.1%</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">34,100</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">2.1%</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">Nation</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">3,710,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">2.9%</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">3,745,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">2.9%</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNow, let&rsquo;s review private-sector job growth -- a statistic frequently touted by the Christie administration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetween January 2010 and April 2012, New Jersey gained 65,600 private-sector jobs for an increase of about 2 percent.
