So what&rsquo;s going on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we checked into it, we found that $5.5 trillion is a misleading number because it only focuses on one side of the ledger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law does include roughly $5.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years, which is the standard time frame for studying bills of this sort. (This just measures the cuts themselves without taking into account any possible economic growth spurred by the cuts.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the law also includes roughly $4 trillion in tax increases. When you add the two numbers together, the net change is roughly $1.5 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the White House is enjoying its dessert (the tax cuts) while ignoring the vegetables (the tax hikes). That provides a skewed version of the bills, tax policy experts say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that the $5.5 trillion figure &quot;is misleading if it&rsquo;s the only one cited. If one figure was going to be cited, it should be the net cost of the bill &mdash; $1.5 trillion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted, however, that the White House did use a more accurate formulation in a more detailed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/tax-cuts-making-america-great/\">web page</a> dated Dec. 21, 2017, that explains the bill&rsquo;s provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that web page, the White House wrote that the bill &quot;provides $5.5 trillion in tax cuts&quot; but that it will also &quot;raise $4 trillion in revenue to help offset tax cuts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the recently enacted tax law includes &quot;$5.5 trillion in tax cuts.&quot; Putting it that way ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. The statement contains an element of truth&nbsp;but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-03T16:50:12.447823", "ruling_date": "2018-01-03T17:25:06", "ruling_headline": "White House is misleading by citing only cuts, not hikes, in tax bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "white-house-misleading-citing-only-cuts-not-hikes-", "ruling_link_text": "Ignores $4 trillion in tax hikes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House, &quot;1600 Daily email,&quot; Jan. 2, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/tax-cuts-making-america-great/\">What Tax Cuts Have to Do with Making America Great Again</a>,&quot; Dec. 21, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.crfb.org/blogs/comparing-conference-report-house-senate-tax-bills\">Comparing the Conference Report With the House &amp; Senate Tax Bills</a>,&quot; Dec. 19, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with John Buhl, spokesman for the Tax Foundation, Jan. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Jan. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with William Gale, co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy center, Jan. 3, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Patrick Newton, spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Jan. 3, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>The new tax law is&nbsp;&quot;kicking the American economy into high gear with $5.5 trillion in tax cuts.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an email from the White House", "statement_date": "2018-01-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "White House is misleading by citing only cuts, not hikes, in tax bill"}
