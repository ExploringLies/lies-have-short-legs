As authorized by voters in 1988, the fund accumulates money from portions of oil and/or gas production taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the latest state <u><a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/finances/Biennial_Revenue_Estimate/bre2014/BRE_2014-15.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">revenue forecast</a></u>, issued Jan. 7, 2013, state Comptroller Susan Combs said the fund&rsquo;s balance would be $8.1 billion by the end of August 2013, assuming lawmakers did not take money out. Due to additional oil-and-gas tax revenue transfers, Combs projected the fund to grow to $9.83 billion at the end of August 2014 and to $11.76 billion a year later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, were lawmakers cutting the fund from $8 billion to $4 billion as Sullivan said?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo our inquiry, Sullivan noted the fund&rsquo;s 2013 balance of $8.1 billion. And, he said by email, taking &quot;out $4 billion is taking out half of the money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe also said he has doubts about the fund&rsquo;s future projected balances of greater than $8 billion. &quot;That is a forecast,&quot; he said. &quot;By definition, it is NOT money currently in the bank, or even an asset. In the bank is $8.1 billion. People hope that it will have $12 billion by late-ish 2015.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I know legislators want us focused on the pre-hatched chicks,&quot; Sullivan said, but &quot;I prefer to count the chickens that have already emerged from the eggs. That is, the current fund balance IS $8 billion. Every other number about the&quot; fund balance &quot;is a forecast. Indeed, looking out to 2015 is not even pre-hatched eggs, it&#39;s pre-conceived chickens.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis analysis made us hungry to learn what lawmakers were voting to take from the fund when he tweeted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohn Barton, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on fiscal matters, told us by telephone that lawmakers approved two measures with a bearing on transfers from the fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA proposed constitutional amendment, <u><a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=SJR1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Senate Joint Resolution 1</a></u>, would launch water infrastructure funds starting with $2 billion from the fund, if voters approve the proposition on the November 2013 ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLawmakers also approved <u><a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB1025\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">House Bill 1025</a></u>, which awaited the review of Gov. Rick Perry as of June 6, 2013. This measure provides for the $2 billion transfer that would be touched off if voters agree to the proposed amendment. In addition, according to the legislation&rsquo;s <u><a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/fiscalnotes/html/HB01025F.htm\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-74f4f316-1b99-d7f9-1ae8-87a90c029ad7\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">fiscal note</a></u>, $1.94 billion would be transferred from the rainy day fund by the end of August 2013, with $1.75 billion of that making up for a payment to school districts that was postponed by the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature. Lesser amounts would be spread among programs overseen by the governor, the Department of Public Safety, the Parks &amp; Wildlife Department and firefighting agencies based at Texas A&amp;M University.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy our read, this shakes out to $1.94 billion in spending from the rainy day fund through August 2013 and, if voters approve, $2 billion more by the end of August 2015, for $3.94 billion in total. It seems, too, that the rainy day fund stands to be reduced by about 25 percent as of the end of August 2013--from a balance of $8.1 billion to a little more than $6.1 billion. And the fund could shrink from an Aug. 31, 2015, projected balance of about $12 billion to about $8 billion, down 33 percent. These calculations assume HB 1025 making it into law and SJR 1 winning voter approval.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ran this thinking by Sullivan, who replied by email that we were adding layers to his tweet, in that the $3.94 billion in intended spending accounts for half of the fund&rsquo;s 2013 balance of about $8 billion. &quot;Some of this spending could be vetoed by the governor or the voters, but the bottom line is that the Legislature did authorize spending half of the current balance,&quot; Sullivan said. &quot;The comptroller has projected a higher balance through the end of fiscal year 2015 &ndash; but that&rsquo;s a projection vs. what&rsquo;s actually in the account today.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also shared our 25 percent/33 percent analysis with fiscal experts who track legislative deliberations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, <u><a href=\"http://www.ttara.org/?q=page/ttarastaff\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Dale Craymer</a></u>, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, and <u><a href=\"http://forabettertexas.org/leadershipwonks.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Eva DeLuna Castro</a></u>, senior budget analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, said our breakdown seemed accurate. <u><a href=\"http://www.texaspolicy.com/experts/talmadge-heflin\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Talmadge Heflin</a></u>, director of the Center for Fiscal Policy at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said Sullivan got it right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCraymer wrote: &quot;If all of the (legislated) appropriations would take effect in 2013,&quot; Sullivan&rsquo;s &quot;Twitter statement would be correct as of the end of 2013; however, all of the appropriations don&rsquo;t take effect in 2013. The water appropriation won&rsquo;t happen until and unless voters approve, with the election in&nbsp; November 2013, which falls in the 2014 fiscal year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCraymer, who is a former chief revenue estimator for the state, also noted that about the time of that election, Combs plans to deposit more money into the fund thanks to &quot;excess oil and gas severance taxes collected in 2013. That deposit is currently estimated at $1.7 billion,&quot; Craymer wrote, &quot;but will probably be higher.&nbsp; In 2015, another deposit currently estimated at $1.8 billion will be made,&quot; Craymer said, &quot;so essentially the fund is rapidly replenishing itself.&quot; If all the legislated spending takes effect, he said, and money gets put into the fund as projected, its balance will go from $6.1 billion at the end of August 2013 to $5.9 billion a year later and $7.8 billion in August 2015.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;While there will certainly be less money in the fund compared to what could be there, the actual balance itself will remain somewhat flat,&quot; Craymer said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeLuna Castro summed up by email that if expectations hold, the fund&rsquo;s balance will not drop to $4 billion at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHeflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, described the &quot;ifs&quot; of legislation becoming law or voters approving the proposed amendment or the comptroller depositing more money into the fund as matters of speculation. The nearly $4 billion is nearly half the fund&rsquo;s 2013 balance, Heflin emailed, so &quot;it looks like the Legislature authorized the fund to be drawn down by half of the current balance.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSullivan tweeted that lawmakers &quot;will be drawing current Economic Stabilization Fund down by half: $4 billion from current $8 billion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $4 billion figure approximates legislated withdrawals from the rainy day fund over more than two years, assuming one measure makes it into law and another wins voter approval. However, it&rsquo;s not correct that the fund will be halved. Its expected August 2013 balance of $8.1 billion could be cut by nearly $2 billion, or 25 percent. Down the road, the fund&rsquo;s projected balance of nearly $12 billion at the end of August 2015 could shrink by 33 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis statement skews these facts by counting current and future expenditures solely against the fund&rsquo;s current balance. Put another way, it assumes all the legislated spending will occur while disregarding expectations that the fund will also accumulate more revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression.
