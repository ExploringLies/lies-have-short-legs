The post came with a startling and real&nbsp;image of Trump sprawled out on the ground. The post and photo were&nbsp;flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant&rsquo;s crackdown on fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously Trump is not dead. Reading a newspaper, turning on a TV or radio or going anywhere else on the Internet will prove that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bu where is that photo coming from? And is it real?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is. It comes from Trump&#39;s&nbsp;2007 appearance at WrestleMania 23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, who knows World Wrestling Entertainment kingpin Vince McMahon, had agreed to the <a href=\"http://www.wwe.com/videos/bobby-lashley-vs-umaga-battle-of-the-billionaires-match-wrestlemania-23\">Battle of the Billionaires</a>. In that storyline, Trump and McMahon both chose a proxy wrestler to compete in the annual pay-per-view event, with the loser having his head shaved in front of the roaring crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This screen grab of an image on fake news sites implied that it was taken after Donald Trump&#39;s imaginary heart attack, but it&#39;s actually Trump suffering from a Stone Cold Stunner during Wrestlemania 23.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the match, Trump clotheslined McMahon prior to Trump&rsquo;s wrestler winning the match. Trump then shaved McMahon&rsquo;s head in the ring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notably absent from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NsrwH9I9vE\">many online clips</a> is <a href=\"http://www.cleveland19.com/story/6311808/donald-trump-wins-hair-match-at-wrestlemania-against-vince-mcmahon\">what happened next</a>: Guest referee Steve Austin <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/09/watching-donald-trump-get-a-stunner-from-stone-cold-steve-austin-will-brighten-up-your-day-6245956/\">delivered a Stone Cold Stunner</a> to Trump, leaving Trump writhing on the mat.

One storyline in 2009 involved Trump buying the WWE&rsquo;s <em>Raw </em>from McMahon, then selling it back to him for twice the price. Even though the sale was fake, it still caused WWE stock to <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2009/06/what-a-raw-deal-investors-and-media-get-punkd-by-wwe-usa-network-9689/\">drop 7 percent</a> at one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump was inducted into the <a href=\"http://www.wwe.com/superstars/donald-trump\">WWE Hall of Fame</a> in 2013. Three years later, the president-elect tapped McMahon&rsquo;s wife Linda McMahon, who donated $6 million to a Trump super PAC, to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/07/trump-picks-wrestling-magnate-linda-mcmahon-to-lead-small-business-administration.html\">head the Small Business Administration</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TheNewYorkEvening.com seems to mix snippets of real stories, like a recent announcement that Ford Motor Company was abandonding plans to build a new plant in Mexico, with fake ones.
