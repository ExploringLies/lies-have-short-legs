Chris Christie heading west to campaign for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, state Sen. Barbara Buono took a moment this week to inform New Jerseyans that the Badger State is leading the nation -- in job losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA little more than a year after signing a bill restricting collective bargaining rights for most public employees -- legislation that set off massive protests and attracted national media attention -- Walker is facing a recall election on June 5. The primary for the recall election is next Tuesday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Christie prepared to visit Wisconsin the next day, Buono, a Democrat representing part of Middlesex County, issued a news release on Monday criticizing the two Republican governors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our governor seems more concerned with one man&rsquo;s job in Wisconsin than the legions of unemployed constituents at home,&quot; Buono said in the news release. &quot;It&rsquo;s not as if Scott Walker has any advice to offer. Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Buono&rsquo;s statistic is on target. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost more jobs than any other state, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how the labor figures break down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe normally analyze job growth in both &quot;net&quot; terms -- the actual number of jobs lost or gained -- and &quot;percentage&quot; terms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy both measures, Wisconsin finished in last place for over-the-year employment changes -- driven in large part by the loss of government jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn March 2012, Wisconsin had 2,730,600 jobs, representing a loss of 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, since March 2011. The state&rsquo;s net loss of jobs far surpassed the next highest amount of 3,500 jobs lost in Mississippi. The March 2012 figures are preliminary and subject to change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNearly 75 percent of the jobs lost in Wisconsin during the past year occurred in the public sector, which accounted for 17,800 of the job losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteven Deller, a professor of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argued that the political dynamics in the state has negatively impacted the business climate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In addition to the massive budget cuts at the state and local level the political dynamics has cast a black cloud over the business climate of the state,&quot; Deller told us in an e-mail. &quot;People/businesses are starting to say &lsquo;stop the political war and work together&rsquo;. This is independent of party affiliation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn case you&rsquo;re wondering how job growth in New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation, here are the Garden State&rsquo;s statistics:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom March 2011 to March 2012, New Jersey gained 38,300 jobs for an increase of 1 percent. That growth represents increases of 35,200 private-sector jobs and 3,100 public-sector jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor total employment changes among all 50 states, New Jersey ranked 15th in net terms and 24th in percentage terms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a news release issued Monday, Buono offered this statistic about the Badger State: &quot;Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to federal labor statistics, Buono&rsquo;s claim is accurate. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, placing the state in last place for both measures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/politifact_nj_with_christie_to.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-01T13:38:02.721169", "ruling_date": "2012-05-02T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "With Chris Christie to campaign for Scott Walker, a New Jersey state senator claimed Wisconsin led the nation in job losses over the past year", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-campaign-scott-walker-new-jersey-st", "ruling_link_text": "A last place finish", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBuono: Christie&rsquo;s Dedication To Scott Walker Illustrates His Priorities, April 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/state-posts-largest-percentage-job-loss-in-us-over-past-year-report-shows-ib54utt-148694855.html\">State posts largest percentage job loss in U.S. over past year</a>, April 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/laus.pdf\">Regional and State Employment and Unemployment -- March 2012</a>, April 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://bls.gov/news.release/laus.t05.htm\">Employees on nonfarm payrolls by state and selected industry sector, seasonally adjusted</a>, accessed April 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Department of Workforce Development, <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2012/unemployment/120425_march_local.pdf?ticker\">March Local Unemployment, Job Numbers Announced</a>, April 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/gov_christie_to_campagin_for_s.html\">Gov.
