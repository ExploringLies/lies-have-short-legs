The same story has been picked up by multiple <a href=\"http://usaupdateddailynews.blogspot.com/2018/02/president-trump-declares-george-soros.html\">websites</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hungarian-born Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/george-soros-democratic-convention-226267\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contributors?id=n00000019\">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros has been a major critic of Trump. After Trump won, Soros called him <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/312109-george-soros-trump-a-would-be-dictator\">&quot;a con artist and would-be dictator.&quot;</a> At a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/george-soros-says-trump-administration-is-danger-to-the-world\">speech</a> in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Soros said, &quot;I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/26/blog-posting/did-austrias-sebastian-kurz-ban-george-soros-organ/\">foundations were banned from Austria</a> and false smears, for example that he<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/alex-jones/infowars-alex-jones-falsely-says-george-soros-hill/\"> instigated racial protests in Charlottesville</a>. Soros, who is Jewish, has also been falsely accused of being a <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/george-soros-ss-nazi-germany/\">Nazi collaborator</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the story said Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about files related to Soros. The story said Trump used a 2014 executive order by Obama to take such action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That<a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/06/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-contributing-situation\"> executive order</a> was real, stating that Obama declared a national emergency to deal with the threat of people undermining democracy in Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Trump used that order to label Soros a threat to national security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soros has been involved in Ukraine for decades and said he established a <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1405/25/fzgps.01.html\">foundation</a> there before it declared independence from the Russia. His International Renaissance Foundation has invested tens of millions in &quot;Ukrainian NGOs, sponsored conferences, scholarships, human-rights confabs and investigative journalists,&quot; the National Post reported in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, Soros called on the west to inject <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-soros/soros-urges-giving-ukraine-50-billion-of-aid-to-foil-russia-idUSKBN0KH0NQ20150108\">$50 billion in Ukraine</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/adrian-karatnycky\">Adrian Karatnycky</a>, an expert on Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, said in general Soros is viewed as a positive figure in Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He is not overtly in step with a particular political party and political movement,&quot; he said. &quot;His foundation is pretty sober-minded, reasonably well regarded in Ukraine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed the Conservative Daily Post and did not get a reply. The <a href=\"https://conservativedailypost.com/about-us/\">Las Vegas-based website</a> states that it &quot;thrives on independent journalism and truth;&quot; however, the story about Soros is not based in evidence.
