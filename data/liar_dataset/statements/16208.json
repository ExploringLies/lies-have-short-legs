He&rsquo;s not a candidate, but <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/barack-obama-rally-las-vegas-economic-growth-democrats-campaign-2018-10-22/\">he is campaigning for Democrats</a>. And some detractors are reviving an old dig against the former president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One day we will realize that the Barack Obama presidency was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people,&quot; reads a quote in an image that was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/donaldtrump4president2016/permalink/2727178307308735/\">posted to Facebook on Nov. 4</a>. It&rsquo;s attributed to Clint Eastwood and appears next to a picture of the actor sitting on a stool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastwood isn&rsquo;t sitting on the stool&mdash;the empty one he talked to during the 2012 Republican National Convention, pretending Obama was seated next to him on stage. He considered the appearance a success, <a href=\"http://www.pineconearchive.com/120907-1.html\">and he said so to the Carmel Pine Cone</a> a few days later. The newspaper covers Eastwood&rsquo;s hometown, <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1854887_1854886_1854876,00.html\">where he was elected mayor in 1986</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A story published in the paper on Sept. 7, 2012, reports that Eastwood had three points that he wanted to make that day: &quot;That not everybody in Hollywood is on the left, that Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and that the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who&rsquo;s not doing a good job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,&quot; the paper quotes Eastwood as saying. &quot;(Mitt) Romney and (Paul) Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that&rsquo;s what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not quite what the Facebook post said. Eastwood was talking about Obama, the person, not his presidency. And he called the then-president a hoax, not a fraud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the quote is close to the spirit of Eastwood&rsquo;s comments. One person who did get it right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump. Three days after the story ran, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/245262384304910336?lang=en\">tweeted</a>: &quot;&lsquo;President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.&rsquo; --Clint Eastwood&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-06T19:00:13.021849", "ruling_date": "2018-11-06T19:06:31", "ruling_headline": "Fraud vs. Hoax: Viral post gets Clint Eastwood knock on Obama close", "ruling_headline_slug": "fraud-vs-hoax-viral-post-gets-clint-eastwood-knock", "ruling_link_text": "Do you feel lucky, punk?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/donaldtrump4president2016/permalink/2727178307308735/\">post</a>, Nov. 4, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/barack-obama-rally-las-vegas-economic-growth-democrats-campaign-2018-10-22/\">&quot;Obama rallies in Las Vegas, tells crowd to &lsquo;remember who started&rsquo; economic growth,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Oct. 22, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Carmel Pine Cone, <a href=\"http://www.pineconearchive.com/120907-1.html\">&quot;Eastwood says his convention appearance was &lsquo;mission accomplished,&rsquo;&quot;</a> Sept. 7, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/clint-eastwood-speaks-to-carmel-pine-cone-about-invisible-obama/2012/09/07/78f7aa72-f918-11e1-a073-78d05495927c_blog.html?utm_term=.f4705e1c4f42\">&quot;Clint Eastwood speaks to Carmel Pine Cone about invisible Obama,&quot;</a> Sept. 7, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time, <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1854887_1854886_1854876,00.html\">&quot;Top 10 actors turned politicians,&quot;</a> visited Nov. 6, 2018<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDonald Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/245262384304910336?lang=en\">tweet</a>, Sept. 10, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Clint Eastwood said &quot;one day we will realize that the Barack Obama presidency was the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on the American people.&quot; \u200b</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a post on Facebook", "statement_date": "2018-11-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
