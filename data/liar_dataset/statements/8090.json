Rick Scott seeking to overturn Florida&rsquo;s &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and draw attention to issues such as racial profiling and arrests of school children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group has been attracting national attention in the wake of the July 13 acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watchman, in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin&rsquo;s case has shined a spotlight on the intersection of race on the criminal justice system and school discipline. (Martin was serving an out-of-school suspension when he was shot while walking to his father&rsquo;s home after buying Skittles and a drink.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 22, Florida&rsquo;s Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Justice, Wansley Walters, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/gubernatorial/floridas-head-of-juvenile-justice-meets-with-protesters/2132651\">met </a>with the Dream Defenders to talk about how to keep children out of the criminal justice system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida,&quot; said Monique Gillum, one of the leaders of Dream Defenders during the meeting. &quot;It makes Florida the nation&#39;s leader in that area.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arrest data on Florida students</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back up her claim, Gillum pointed to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/741953-djj-2011-12-report.html\">report</a> that states that 12,520 youth were arrested for school-related arrests during the 2011-12 year. (School-related includes arrests at school, the bus or bus stop, and school-sponsored events.) About two-thirds were for misdemeanors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The department pointed us to the same report to show that the number of youth school-related arrests have declined 48 percent since the 2004-05 school year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason for the decline is that the majority of Florida school districts have started using civil citations for non-violent misdemeanors. The citations include penalties such as community service. If the student complies, no arrest goes on their record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being arrested at school can be traumatic. Even if the arrest doesn&rsquo;t ultimately lead to a conviction, it can still hurt students because they may have to <a href=\"http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/maps/map-florida-students-arrested-for-bad-behavior-not-criminal-behavior/\">disclose it</a> on job or college applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Miami-Dade school district, the largest in the state and the one where Martin was a student, was the first to implement civil citations -- and that could be why it had far fewer arrests than several smaller districts. (Walters was at the Miami-Dade County Juvenile Services Department at the time and led the effort to push for civil citations.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report shows school-related arrests by sheer numbers and by rate per 1,000 students in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/741953-djj-2011-12-report.html\">counties</a> in 2011-12. We will cite a few examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Miami-Dade: 552, three per 1,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Broward: 1,062, eight per 1,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Hillsborough: 1,046, 10 per 1,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Pinellas: 846, 15 per 1,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Pasco: 316, 9 per 1,000</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the numbers of arrests statewide dropped in recent years after the state relaxed its &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy, critics say schools have still gone too far in criminalizing typical youthful behavior. We found arrests for infractions such as<a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-02-09/news/fl-school-arrests-jail-pipeline-20130209_1_school-arrests-show-disabled-students-school-bus\"> throwing spitballs</a>, hitting someone with a <a href=\"http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/maps/map-florida-students-arrested-for-bad-behavior-not-criminal-behavior/\">tootsie pop</a> or even for repeatedly &quot;<a href=\"http://www.naacpldf.org/files/publications/Police%20in%20Schools%20are%20Not%20the%20Answer%20to%20the%20Newtown%20Shooting%20-%20Jan.%202013.pdf\">passing gas</a>.&quot; &nbsp;(The 13-year-old boy busted for flatulence never went before a judge; the Martin County school district told us the case was &quot;diverted/dropped with no record for the student.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The vast majority of children being arrested in schools are not committing criminal acts,&quot; Walters told the <em><a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-02-10/features/os-school-arrests-florida-prison-pipeline-20130209_1_school-arrests-disabled-students-juvenile-justice\">Orlando Sentinel</a> </em>earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>National comparison data lacking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the 12,000 figure isn&rsquo;t in dispute. But comparing Florida&rsquo;s school-related arrests to the rest of the nation was far more complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National &quot;data-keeping in this realm is indeed pretty awful,&quot; said Kevin G. Welner, professor and director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. That sentiment was echoed by multiple experts we interviewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Florida does a better job than most states at compiling the data. An expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center said the state has the most comprehensive data in the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dream Defenders sent us an article from <em><a href=\"http://www.ebony.com/black-listed/news-views/floridas-school-to-prison-pipeline-is-the-nations-largest-981#axzz2KyqQNzU9\">Ebony</a></em>, which stated, &quot;While Florida is <a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/11/school_prison_pipeline_meridian.html\">not alone</a> in turning to police to discipline young people, it has the distinction of being the nation&rsquo;s leader in school-based arrests.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Ebony </em>linked to a 2013 article in <em><a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/02/in_2012_florida_arrested_12000_students_in_school--and_that_was_an_improvement.html\">Color Lines</a></em>, a magazine that focuses on issues pertaining to race. Its report stated: &quot;Last year, Florida produced the highest documented number of school-based arrests in the country &mdash; and that number was an improvement over previous years.&quot; (One expert we interviewed noted the important qualifier in that sentence: documented. As we&rsquo;ll see, little is documented in this area.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillum directed us to a 2011 <a href=\"http://b.3cdn.net/advancement/28126d1c2dd547b9f9_0um6btbgo.pdf\">report</a> about Florida school arrests written by the Advancement Project, a national civil rights group, along with the ACLU in Florida and the NAACP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Florida still has the highest documented number of school-based referrals to law enforcement in the country,&quot; states the report. A footnote had this to say: &quot;Currently, this data is not collected nationwide. Many individual states report this information, but no other state reports as many school-based referrals to law enforcement as Florida.&quot; We couldn&#39;t get a definitive answer from the group about how many states actually did report data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The report should have conveyed Florida&rsquo;s data is the highest on record,&quot; Advancement Project spokeswoman Jennifer Farmer told PolitiFact Florida. &quot;It may not be the highest in the country but it&#39;s highest on record.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found some data is collected at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://ocrdata.ed.gov/Home\">Office for Civil Rights</a>. But that data appears to have significant gaps and inconsistencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California, pointed out a few examples of questionable numbers, including <a href=\"http://ocrdata.ed.gov/Page?t=d&amp;eid=30388&amp;syk=5&amp;pid=119\">Los Angeles</a>, which had zero referrals or arrests in 2009. <a href=\"http://ocrdata.ed.gov/Page?t=d&amp;eid=31597&amp;syk=5&amp;pid=119\">Broward County</a> had 6,640 referrals to law enforcement, but 0 arrests, while <a href=\"http://ocrdata.ed.gov/Page?t=d&amp;eid=31603&amp;syk=5&amp;pid=119\">Miami-Dade</a> had 1,670 referrals to law enforcement and 10 arrests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter the ranking, &quot;Florida has a very serious issue with overly punitive discipline and over-reliance on law enforcement that harms children and adolescents in the state, and is especially harmful to children of color,&quot; Losen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dream Defenders said, &quot;Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation&#39;s leader in that area.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number about Florida is correct: There were 12,520 students arrested at schools in 2011-12, according to the state Department of Juvenile Justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Dream Defenders failed to prove that the number makes Florida the nation&rsquo;s leader in school-related arrests. This appears to be a case of the state getting a bad rap because of its rare decision to publish comprehensive data. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple experts said that comprehensive data for state-by-state comparisons is lacking. That makes it difficult to declare Florida&rsquo;s ranking for school-related arrests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-30T11:48:10.322318", "ruling_date": "2013-07-30T16:38:57", "ruling_headline": "'Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida.
