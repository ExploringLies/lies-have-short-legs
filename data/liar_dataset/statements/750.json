Single workers would get $500, and working couples would get $1,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n But not all taxpayers get paychecks from an employer, and those&nbsp;who don't would not get the credit. Additionally, Obama intends to raise taxes on higher brackets ($200,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples) which would offset any tax cuts for those incomes.\n</p>\n<p>\n A detailed analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that if you look at all tax filers, 81 percent of tax filers would see reduced taxes under the Obama plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n So Obama's statement at the debate glosses over a few important details about who would get tax cuts under his plan. If you're talking about everyone, it's 81 percent.&nbsp;If you're talking about working families, it's 95 percent. The difference between 81 percent and 95 percent is not insignificant.
