Scott Walker is planning to strip away their guaranteed pension benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chain email that has rapidly been making the rounds among Democrats and public employees claims Walker is &quot;openly&quot; backing a move to abolish the Wisconsin Retirement System in favor of a system that will cut pensions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe retirement system has 430,000 members, including retired and active teachers, state and municipal employees. So that&rsquo;s a lot of potential interest in the topic. We have received a dozen or more requests to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere are some of the key points from the <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/pension+email.doc\">chain email</a>, including its tortured syntax:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Walker is saying that after he wins the recall election, he plans to push thru the legislature a plan to abolish the state retirement system and convert everyone to 401 K which will reduce our pensions by at least a third,&quot; the email says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Tell everybody you know, included those already retired, because if Walker wins we are all in big trouble&hellip;. This is not a rumor, he is openly talking about it in Madison, it just isn&#39;t being publicized. Remember how nobody thought he would do anything to the union.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email is built around its own contradiction: Walker is &quot;openly talking about it&quot; yet &quot;it just isn&rsquo;t being publicized.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s just one tack taken by those claiming Walker is out to gut the pension system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore than 32,000 people have signed a Move.On.org-sponsored online <a href=\"http://signon.org/sign/save-the-wisconsin-retiremen\">petition</a> that opposes an alleged Walker plan to &quot;radically alter&quot; the retirement system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the state teachers union is organizing a March 1, 2012 meeting on what it what it termed Walker&rsquo;s plan to &quot;seriously undermine&quot; retirement security. &quot;If you think that you are safe because you are retired, THINK AGAIN,&quot; says a flier from the Wisconsin Education Association Council.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe concerns did not develop out of thin air.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey date to early 2011, after Walker&rsquo;s budget repair bill called for a study of the 401(k)-style concept. That study was later approved in the <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2011-13-Budget/documents/Comparative%20Summary%20of%20Budget%20Recommendations%202011%20Act%2032%20Vol.%201.pdf\">2011-2012 budget</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe budget calls for a study to be completed by June 30, 2012 of &quot;establishing a defined contribution plan as an option for participating employees.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Defined contribution&quot; refers to a 401(k)-style concept. (A second study topic is allowing employees to opt out of making contributions).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study comes after last year&rsquo;s changes that required most public employees to contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward their pension.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWalker&#39;s administration, in response to the growing public profile of the issue, sent <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/WRS+Study.pdf\">a letter</a> to all WRS participants on Feb. 24, 2012 outlining the study&#39;s rationale.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow does the pension system work?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe current WRS is a modified version of a &quot;defined benefit&quot; system. It offers a guaranteed pension funded mostly from pooled investments in which risk is shared between the employer and the employees. Pension are based mainly on years of service and final salary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, under a &quot;defined contribution&quot; system, future benefits are not guaranteed at a specific level and workers bear the investment risk in an individual account.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s actually precedent for this kind of system in Wisconsin: Before 1966, then-separate funds for teachers and state workers were of the defined-contribution type, according to a history done by the nonpartisan <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Informational-Papers/Documents/2011/84_Wisconsin%20Retirement%20System.pdf\">Legislative Fiscal Bureau</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts told the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/117472998.html\">Journal Sentinel</a> &nbsp;at the time that Walker&rsquo;s study, along with the governor&rsquo;s ultimately successful move to eliminate of collective bargaining over pension changes, could herald an eventual conversion to a 401(k)-type plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the chain email makes a different, much bolder claim: That the decision to abolish the system has already been made and, indeed, Walker is &quot;openly&quot; backing such a move.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, little has been written or said about even what the study is looking at.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Mike Huebsch, secretary of the state Department of Administration, if the study would look at putting future hires into a 401(k)-style plan, as Michigan did. We also asked about <a href=\"http://www.nasra.org/resources/HybridBrief.pdf\">&quot;hybrid&quot; systems</a>, which combine the traditional guaranteed pension with a 401(k)- type program, such as in Indiana. And we asked if the study included a purely voluntary option where employees could choose to participate in a 401(k)-type program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHuebsch said all three approaches would be studied but &quot;there is no intent at this point of forcing anybody into a system they wouldn&rsquo;t want to be part of.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said he was aware of the outcry in other states when workers were forced into a 401(k)-style plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That&rsquo;s why we would give them the option,&quot; Huebsch said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker recently commented on the study in an <a href=\"http://www.channel3000.com/politics/30451142/detail.html\">interview with WISC-TV in Madison</a>, saying that alternatives would be evaluated according to &quot;a balance of protecting hardworking taxpayers and providing whatever we might provide in a respectful and responsible way.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker also said: &quot;Despite all the hype and rumors out there, for people in the pension system right now, I can&#39;t anticipate anything in the future that wouldn&#39;t allow them to continue in that pension system if that&#39;s what they prefer to do.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat contradicts the idea that Walker is openly touting elimination of the system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker spokesman Cullen Werwie reiterated that Walker would await the study to determine if any changes needed to be made. No specific options are under active consideration, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin already has a slight flavor of a defined-contribution plan, in that annual growth in retirees&rsquo; basic pension varies with state pension-fund earnings. Still, retirees are guaranteed a pension no lower than the level when they retired, unless they pick a high-risk option.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHuebsch said that far from &quot;abolishing&quot; the retirement system, the goal is to determine how the Wisconsin system can remain stable and avoid the massive shortfalls facing other states&rsquo; pension funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts say the Wisconsin pension fund is one of the healthiest in the United States, offers a relatively modest benefit and <a href=\"http://www.nasra.org/resources/NASRACostsBrief1202.pdf\">costs taxpayers less</a> as a share of governmental spending than plans in nearly all other states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the email&rsquo;s most provocative suggestions is that existing employees -- and even those already retired -- would see major benefit reductions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut legal experts say retirees almost certainly would be unaffected by any changes under discussion. Courts, they say, have consistently protected benefits already earned by retirees and current workers as a property right -- though governments are increasingly testing that principle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, judges have blessed changes that affect new hires who have never been under an existing system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHuebsch made clear how he viewed Wisconsin law: Changing any benefits already earned would be illegal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCould the state leave their previously accrued pension benefits in place but change them for future earnings?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome states, including <a href=\"http://www.treasury.ri.gov/secure-path-ri/faq/hybrid-how.php\">Rhode Island</a>, have required current employees to participate in &quot;hybrid&quot; pension plans that combine elements of both types of plans. Workers are suing over cuts in what they will receive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin state statute <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wi.gov/statutes/statutes/40/I/19\">40.19</a> says &quot;Rights exercised and benefits accrued to an employee under this chapter for service rendered shall be due as a contractual right and shall not be abrogated by any subsequent legislative act.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the statute also speaks of the state&rsquo;s right to change benefits going forward.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Employee Trust Funds department, which administers the pension fund, said in <a href=\"http://etf.wi.gov/news/ht-wrs-study12092011.pdf\">a statement on its website</a> that any changes &quot;could only apply to the accrual of future benefits.&quot; That leaves open changing benefits going forward for current employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chain email making the rounds claims Walker is &quot;openly&quot; backing a move to abolish the state retirement system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile a study of the system is under way, the email&rsquo;s claim jumps the gun and goes way too far. We don&rsquo;t yet know the study&rsquo;s conclusions, and Walker&rsquo;s administration says no decisions have been made on making any changes at all. What&rsquo;s more, legal experts say in all likelihood any changes would have to be going forward -- and retirees have the most protection.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the email&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-23T21:27:52.772949", "ruling_date": "2012-02-27T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Chain email says Gov.
