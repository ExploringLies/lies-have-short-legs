This is flat wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have been exporting coal, natural gas, electricity, refined products and energy technologies for a very long time,&quot; Paul Sullivan, a professor at National Defense University, told us in August. &quot;Liquefied natural gas exports from Alaska to Japan have been around for a long time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump might have meant that the United States had only recently become a <em>net</em> exporter of energy &mdash; meaning the total of all U.S. energy exports recently overtook the total of all U.S. energy imports. That&rsquo;s also inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This has been falling, but we are still a huge net energy importer,&quot; Jason Bordoff, who directs Columbia University&rsquo;s Center on Global Energy Policy, told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its most recent projections, the federal Energy Information Administration <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29433\">concluded</a> that the United States would become a net energy exporter <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/05/united-states-may-become-net-energy-exporter-by-2026-eia-reports.html\">around 2026</a>, depending on the course of future patterns of global supply, demand and pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States has been a net coal exporter for many years. It has been a net exporter of refined petroleum products since <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=21972\">around 2011</a>. So neither of those would make Trump correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural gas has done better. In the Energy Information Administration&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf\">January 2018</a> shorter-term energy outlook, it reported that &quot;in 2017, the United States was a net exporter of natural gas for the first time on an annual basis since 1957.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the White House and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States has been exporting different forms of energy for many years. It has been a net exporter of coal and refined petroleum products, a fact that predates Trump. The one new development is natural gas. For the first time since 1957, the United States became a net exporter in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall though, it is a net energy importer, a situation that&rsquo;s not expected to change until midway through the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-01-31T00:36:34.469827", "ruling_date": "2018-01-31T00:20:25", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump exaggerates energy exports", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-exaggerates-energy-exports", "ruling_link_text": "Still a net energy importer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/30/trump-state-of-the-union-2018-transcript-full-text-379363\">2018 State of the Union address</a>, Jan. 30, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Information Administration, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/\">Annual Energy Outlook</a>,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/presentations/sieminski_01052017.pdf\">Jan. 5, 2017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Information Administration, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=21972\">Net petroleum product exports continue to increase</a>,&quot; July 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Information Administration, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrexus1&amp;f=a\">U.S. Exports of Crude Oil</a>,&quot; accessed Aug 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf\">Short-Term Energy Outlook</a>, January 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Paul Sullivan, professor at National Defense University and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, Aug. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Anna Mikulska, fellow with Rice University&rsquo;s Center for Energy Studies, Aug. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University&rsquo;s Center on Global Energy Policy, Aug. 23, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 135, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 211, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 93, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 92, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 649, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "the 2018 State of the Union address", "statement_date": "2018-01-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Trump exaggerates energy exports"}
