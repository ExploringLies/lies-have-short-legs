That&rsquo;s not what any Democrat is running on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/aug/26/bernie-sanders-socialist-or-democratic-socialist/\">Bernie Sanders</a> or <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/personalities/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> use the term, they are referring to expanding the social programs already available, along with <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/\">potentially higher tax rates</a> to pay for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That resonates with the systems in place in Canada or Europe; not Venezuela or Cuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the programs that may be labeled as socialist carry broad support, like Social Security, &quot;which has secured bipartisan support for over 70 years,&quot; Gamarra said.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&quot;100 percent government-run health care&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This attack is misleading because Medicare for All doesn&rsquo;t call for a fully government-run health care system. It&rsquo;s a gross exaggeration to claim all Democrats support the measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicare for All is the most fundamental change to the health insurance system among the &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-for-all-and-public-plan-buy-in-proposals-overview-and-key-issues/\">proposals</a> put forth by Democrats in Congress, according to Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. Sanders&rsquo; bill has 16 Democratic co-sponsors and similar legislation in the House has 123 co-sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Peter Dreier, a political theorist at Occidental College, said Medicare for All does not fit the bill of socialism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In Medicare for All, private providers, private doctors, nurses and hospitals will provide the health care,&quot; Dreier said. &quot;The government will provide the insurance, which is what Medicare is now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other senators have introduced similar, though less sweeping, bills to provide a Medicare buy-in &nbsp;through the marketplace or for older individuals who have not yet hit 65.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&quot;Immediate tax increases&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no &quot;immediate&quot; tax increases on the horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Democrats have called for changing or repealing parts of last year&#39;s tax cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March, Senate Democrats <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Democrats-unveil-1T-infrastructure-plan-funded-by-cuts-to-tax-overhaul/5261520441530/\">unveiled</a> a plan to finance infrastructure projects by rolling back parts of the law. Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Bill Nelson of Florida presented the <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Senate%20Democrats'%20Jobs%20and%20Infrastructure%20Plan.pdf\">blueprint</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan calls for increased taxes for corporations and the rich as well as cutting the carried interest loophole that benefits some money managers, while repealing or reforming the cap on state and local tax deductions (which would be a cut).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the proposal is unlikely to go anywhere soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whoever wins control in November, there is still Republican President Trump in the White House,&quot; said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. &quot;So even in the unlikely event that both chambers flip to Democrats, they won&#39;t be able to do anything &lsquo;immediate&rsquo; regarding taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">&quot;Undefended open borders&quot;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Democratic leaders have called for a restructuring of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, but no one has called for immigrants to freely cross the border. A few Democrats seem to want the agency shuttered, but others talk of restructuring or a new focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi have called for reforms to ICE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jul/03/abolish-ice-movement-getting-louder-its-disbanding/\">July</a>, we <a href=\"https://blumenauer.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-blumenauer-introduce-legislation-abolish-ice\">found</a> <a href=\"https://www.jimmcgovern.com/2018/06/28/its-time-abolish-ice/\">six</a> <a href=\"https://velazquez.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/vel-zquez-calls-abolish-ice\">additional</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/1005965526232607\">Democrats</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/politics/abolish-ice-democrats-list/index.html\">in the House and</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/28/politics/gillibrand-ice-cnntv/index.html\">Senate</a> who have said they want to &quot;abolish,&quot; &quot;dismantle&quot; or replace ICE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/following-trip-to-southern-border-pocan-to-introduce-legislation-that\">said</a> he planned to introduce legislation to abolish ICE, because the Trump administration had &quot;so misused ICE that the agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s hardly all Democrats, and it&rsquo;s not a call for open borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t support open borders, I don&rsquo;t know any Democrat who supports open borders,&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/repmarkpocan/status/1013048256706809857\">Pocan said in a June 30 Twitter video</a>. &quot;In fact, ICE doesn&rsquo;t operate at the borders. The Customs and Border Protection operates at the borders. So anyone who says that, is either ill-informed or outright lying.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Future 45 said voting for &quot;any Democrat&quot; gets you &quot;socialism ... undefended open borders ... immediate tax increases ... 100% government run health care ...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic Party is a tent that houses a wide variety of views. Some candidates are self-proclaimed socialists, but even their platforms don&rsquo;t fit the narrow definition of traditional socialism. Some, not all, support expansions of Medicare, but that would not qualify as 100 percent government-run health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These and other policies may raise taxes, but immediate tax increases are unlikely under a Republican president. The tax increases on the table mostly target the rich and corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, Congressional Democratic leaders have called for a restructuring of ICE, but no candidate has called for undefended open borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad cherry-picks extreme positions and suggests all Democrats support them.
