Scott Walker helped run a &quot;criminal scheme&quot; to violate campaign laws, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin posted a web video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wBFohHHSF4&amp;feature=youtu.be\">&quot;Wisconsin Deserves Better,&quot;</a> ends with a question-and-answer segment in which Walker appears to acknowledge guilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That sequence starts with audio of part of a question asked of Walker by reporter <a href=\"http://www.todaystmj4.com/about/people/121515624.html\">Charles Benson of WTMJ-TV</a>, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee. He was among a group of reporters seeking Walker&rsquo;s reaction on June 19, 2014, after the legal brief came out as part of a lawsuit by a conservative group under investigation in the Doe probe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benson, not shown at first, is heard saying to Walker: &quot;...that you are the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abruptly, the audio goes out, the video goes to slow motion, and Walker nods his head up and down with eyes closed and sort of a grim look on his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our State Deserves Better&quot; appears on the screen as the video ends without any verbal evidence of Walker&rsquo;s response to Benson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://youtu.be/4wBFohHHSF4\">video is on the party&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a>, and was promoted on its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WisDems\">Facebook page</a> and state party&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://wisdems.org/news/press/view/2014-06-wisdems-release-new-web-video-wisconsin-deserves-bet\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tale of the tape</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the bottom of the screen during the sequence with Benson and Walker, the video credit appears to be WEAU-TV, the NBC affiliate in Eau Claire. The station picked up the feed from WTMJ and aired it June 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the report originally aired on WTMJ, so we looked at the station&rsquo;s segment regarding the release of the prosecution&rsquo;s brief and Walker&rsquo;s reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We examined the relevant parts of the TMJ interview, and the Dem video, and <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/video/?bctid=3647181706001\">created our own video with those clips</a> back to back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the WTMJ segment, anchors introduce the story and then go to Benson, who says, &quot;Well, the new documents are public after conservative groups sued in Federal Court to stop the investigation. Prosecutors allege a criminal scheme. Walker says the allegations from a partisan Milwaukee D.A. are false.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After showing some highlights of the prosecution&rsquo;s theory of the case, the segment cuts to Benson questioning Walker. It&rsquo;s the complete version of the sequence truncated by the Dems in their video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first tipoff to the fact that the Dem video is manipulated: In the WTMJ segment, unlike in the Dem video, Benson is on screen when he asks Walker: &quot;Prosecutors in the John Doe investigation allege that you are at the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; Walker says immediately, shaking his head side to side. The WTMJ segments cuts away at that point, back to Benson, who says: &quot;Walker says no laws were broken, and the case was rejected by two judges who have reviewed the allegations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, WTMJ cuts back to the reporters interviewing Walker, who is shown saying, &quot;And I asked people to look at the facts, and the facts are pretty clear. A judge at the state and the federal level made it clear that they didn&rsquo;t buy into this argument. They said to move on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a degree in YouTube to see that Walker actually bobbed his head &quot;yes&quot; during Benson&rsquo;s question, not in response to Benson. (As those who follow Walker know, he uses the head bob frequently when listening to people as he campaigns or when taking in reporters&rsquo; questions.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Mike Tate about the discrepancy between the two videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tate referred us to party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, who acknowledged that it appears Walker shakes his head yes in the party&rsquo;s video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t intentional or an attempt to mislead, Baldauff said. The party was trying to &quot;layer together clips&quot; of news coverage of the Doe issue and about the jobs reports that came out the same week, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson wasn&rsquo;t buying that explanation Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This Democrat Party propaganda is another attempt to mislead the voters from the facts and distract from Mary Burke&#39;s failed record as Jim Doyle&#39;s commerce secretary,&quot; Evenson said, referring to Walker&rsquo;s leading Democratic Party challenger in the fall governor&rsquo;s race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTMJ news director Janet Hundley and WEAU general manager Terry McHugh assisted PolitiFact in locating video of the Walker segment. Neither wanted to comment on the Dem video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Democratic Party web video making the rounds on social media shows a grim-faced Gov. Scott Walker appearing to bob his head yes to a reporter&rsquo;s question about whether he was at the center of a &quot;criminal scheme&quot; to evade campaign finance laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In real life, the governor answered an emphatic &quot;no&quot; -- &nbsp;not surprising given he&rsquo;s been denying any wrongdoing since new documents were released in the John Doe investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dem video, in its editing of the WTMJ clip, leaves the viewer with the misleading and ridiculous impression that Walker is somehow admitting guilt in the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-27T18:40:01.709087", "ruling_date": "2014-06-27T17:39:00", "ruling_headline": " In Democratic Party video ad, Scott Walker nods yes when asked if he\u2019s part of \u2018criminal scheme\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "democratic-party-video-ad-scott-walker-nods-yes-wh", "ruling_link_text": "What part of 'no' didn't they understand?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Democratic Party of Wisconsin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wBFohHHSF4&amp;feature=youtu.be\">web video,</a> June 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/video/?bctid=3647181706001\">Journal Sentinel-produced video</a> comparing the WTMJ interview and the same interview in the Democratic Party video, created June 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTMJ4-TV, <a href=\"http://www.jrn.com/tmj4/news/Prosecutors-Gov-Walker-part-of-criminal-scheme-263856501.html\">&quot;Prosecutors: Gov.
