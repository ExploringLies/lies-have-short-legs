On Oct. 1 he landed in Johnson City, Tenn., to help U.S. Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn, covering familiar ground about the improving economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He touted securing $716 billion for the military, and he gave Republicans credit for giving veterans a new health care option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We just passed Choice,&quot; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HkzIrGSctSk?t=5h13m15s\">Trump said</a>. &quot;That was 44 years, they&rsquo;ve been trying to pass Choice. So that if you have to wait for nine days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don&rsquo;t do that anymore. If the line is big, and you&rsquo;re unhappy, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you and we pay the bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump repeated the point, saying, &quot;They&rsquo;ve been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn&rsquo;t do it. We got it passed. We&rsquo;re good at passing things, right?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is wrong that Choice wasn&rsquo;t passed until he came into office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress passed a new version of a Choice program in <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2372/\">June 2018</a> &mdash; but the program itself has been around since 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the scandal of long waits and the efforts of administrators at some facilities to cover that up, Congress and the Obama administration passed the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3230\">Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For veterans who couldn&rsquo;t be given appointments quickly enough, or who lived more than 40 miles from a Veterans Health Administration hospital, the government would pay for private care. In four years, Washington spent <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45047.pdf#page=10\">$12 billion on the program</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill signed by Trump, the VA Mission Act, is a <a href=\"https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/docs/pubfiles/factsheets/FactSheet_20-13.pdf\">major effort to fold a variety of community care programs</a> at the VA into one integrated whole. That change won&rsquo;t take place for at least a year. Until then, the law provides $5.2 billion to continue the Choice program in its present form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that he and his fellow Republican &quot;passed Choice,&quot; something that others had been trying to do for 44 years. He described the program as one that allowed veterans to get private care at government expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program to do exactly that has been around for four years. And it&rsquo;s always been referred to as Choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-02T10:31:01.547937", "ruling_date": "2018-10-02T15:02:31", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump: GOP just passed veteran's Choice after 44-year wait.
