Dourif was not a guest on Rachel Maddow and never gave that quote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website also falsely states that Dourif is employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at a Washington mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This information was uncovered by <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/\">Gateway Pundit&rsquo;s</a> Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that &lsquo;Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif,&#39; &quot; states The Last Line of Defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, and found no mention of Dourif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several signs that the The Last Line of Defense article is fake news. First, Fiona Dourif is an actress born in 1981, so it would have been impossible for someone to molest her decades earlier. (Dourif played the role of Nica Pierce in the horror movies<em> Cult of Chucky </em>and<em> Curse of Chucky</em>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, Moore would have been 10 years old in 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, a <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.online/about-us/\">disclaimer </a>on the Last Line of Defense&rsquo;s website states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;America&rsquo;s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth.
