The article goes on to say that in August 2015, the National Cancer Institute released a report on its website that stated &quot;marijuana kills cancer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story was flagged as part of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.) It was published on ehealthmagz.com but it&rsquo;s unclear what the website is actually called. The website&rsquo;s browser tab says &quot;Health Magazine,&quot; but at the bottom of the page, an &quot;about us&quot; section describes the site as, simply, &quot;Newspaper.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Newspaper is your news, entertainment, music fashion website,&quot; it says. &quot;We provide you with the latest breaking news and videos straight from the entertainment industry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An email we sent to the contract address on the website&mdash;<a href=\"mailto:contact@yoursite.com\">contact@yoursite.com</a>&mdash;bounced back. Though the website credits the article to &quot;Stoners Cookbook,&quot; the link leads to a broken web page. But, the story also links to <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#section/_7\">a page about cannabis and cannabinoids</a> on the website for the National Center Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an email, a spokesperson for the National Cancer Institute directed PolitiFact to the same web page about cannabis and cannabinoids. However, according to a statement from the institute, &quot;this page is not a report or study.&quot; It&rsquo;s a summary that has been on the institute&rsquo;s website for about 13 years and that is maintained and updated &quot;by an editorially independent board of private-sector and public-sector experts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information in the summary reflects a review of biomedical literature, according to the statement; it doesn&rsquo;t represent a policy statement from the institute or the National Institutes of Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cannabis page was updated in August 2015, like the story says, and in August 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But nowhere on the site does it say &quot;marijuana kills cancer.&quot; Here&rsquo;s some information it does include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cannabinoids activate specific receptors throughout the body to produce pharmacologic effects.</li>\r\n\t<li>Some cannabinoids are approved drugs to treat cancer-related side effects, and they may have benefits in the treatment of cancer-related side effects.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#section/_7\">One study</a> using rodents suggested that cannabinoids may ward against the development of certain types of tumors. In another study, &quot;cannabinoids appear to kill tumor cells.&quot; &quot;Other studies have shown the antitumor effect of cannabinoids&hellip; in preclinical models of breast cancer.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>However, &quot;no ongoing clinical trials of cannabis as a treatment for cancer in humans were identified&quot; in a search of studies, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#section/_9\">according a National Cancer Institute web page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in labs, and it may benefit the side effects of cancer treatments, like chemotherapies, it&rsquo;s not an FDA-approved cancer treatment, there isn&rsquo;t enough evidence for doctors to recommend it as a treatment for cancer-related symptoms and the National Cancer Institute has not admitted that marijuana kills cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-30T09:32:23.749502", "ruling_date": "2018-10-30T09:31:56", "ruling_headline": "No, the National Cancer Institute has not named marijuana a cancer cure", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-national-cancer-institute-does-not-named-mariju", "ruling_link_text": "Pot has medical uses, but \"curing\" cancer is not one", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Health Magazine, <a href=\"http://ehealthmagz.com/2018/07/10/cancer-institute-finally-admits-marijuana-kills-cancer/?fbclid=IwAR1NMXgFavLO_qjB8yX2sIYYewdrxznVuM2DPVeq-UMRdYFTBx64bH0idUQ\">&quot;Cancer institute finally admits marijuana kills cancer,&quot;</a> July 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Cancer Institute, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#section/_7\">&quot;Cannabis and cannabinoids (PDQ)-health professional version,&quot;</a> visited Oct. 29, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email correspondence with the National Cancer Institute, Oct. 29, 2018</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 26, "current_job": "", "false_count": 87, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 279, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 425, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Cancer institute finally admits marijuana kills cancer.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a post on Facebook", "statement_date": "2018-07-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
