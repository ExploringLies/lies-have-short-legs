Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., for his support of Christine Blasey Ford&rsquo;s testimony against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump dubbed Blumenthal &quot;Da Nang Richard,&quot; a reference to a battleground in the Vietnam War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This guy lied about his service,&quot; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6yAYEu_sBeE?t=13m\">Trump said Oct. 2</a>. &quot;He didn&#39;t just say &lsquo;Gee, I was in the service.&rsquo; No, he said, &lsquo;I was in the Marines. Da Nang province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.&rsquo; This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Here&#39;s a guy who was saying people were dying all around him. And he was never there. And then he cried when they caught him. He cried like a baby, like a baby.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-sen-blumenthal-lied-about-his-service/\">companion fact-check</a>, we looked at Trump&rsquo;s claim that Blumenthal &quot;lied&quot; about his Vietnam service. (Mostly True.) Here, we look at the rest of Trump&rsquo;s words, the ones about Da Nang and crying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is wrong that Blumenthal spun heroic war stories, and cried when he was called out for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Vietnam legacy</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Blumenthal and Trump avoided serving in Vietnam. <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2015/jul/21/was-trump-draft-dodger/\">Trump benefited</a> from four student deferments in college and one medical deferment (which Trump later said was for bone spurs in his heels), before being classified 4-F, unfit to serve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Trump never claimed to have been there, Blumenthal sometimes did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970. Until then, five deferments had kept him out of the war. Getting a coveted slot in the reserves reduced the chance of battlefield deployment. Blumenthal went through basic training and served six years in the Washington, D.C, area and Connecticut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/nyregion/18blumenthal.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;\">New York Times</a> reported that at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, &quot;We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newspaper provided another example from a 2003 event. &quot;When we returned, we saw nothing like this,&quot; Blumenthal told military families. &quot;Let us do better by this generation of men and women.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A day after the New York Times story, Blumenthal held a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4750956/senator-richard-blumenthal-military-service-press-conference-051810\">news conference</a> in West Hartford, Conn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I routinely describe my pride at having served in the United States Marine Corps Reserves during the Vietnam era,&quot; Blumenthal said, flanked by veterans. &quot;On a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service. And I regret that, and I take full responsibility.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some argued that there also was no apology. Blumenthal <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/nyregion/25blumenthal.html\">released a statement</a> about a week later saying, &quot;I have made mistakes and I am sorry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can find no record that Blumenthal ever described being in Da Nang or any other place in Vietnam. (And for the record, Da Nang is a city, not a province, although it serves the same administrative role as a province in Vietnamese governance.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the White House and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Blumenthal said he saw battle in Da Nang, and &quot;then he cried when they caught him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blumenthal never spoke of fighting in Da Nang or anywhere else in Vietnam. He did not cry when he acknowledged his misleading statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those elements are pure Trump invention. We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-04T15:44:18.029120", "ruling_date": "2018-10-04T17:55:47", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump's inventions about Richard Blumenthal and Vietnam", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trumps-inventions-about-richard-blumenthal-", "ruling_link_text": "Trump as novelist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6yAYEu_sBeE?t=13m\">Rally in Southaven, Miss</a>., Oct. 2, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/nyregion/18blumenthal.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;\">Candidate&rsquo;s Words on Vietnam Service Differ From History</a>, May 17, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4750956/senator-richard-blumenthal-military-service-press-conference-051810\">Senator Richard Blumenthal military service press conference</a>, May 18, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stamford Advocate, <a href=\"https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Blumenthal-tells-different-story-in-complete-video-492661.php\">Blumenthal tells different story in complete video</a>, May 19, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/nyregion/22blumenthal.html\">More Blumenthal claims of Vietnam war service surface</a>, May 22, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hartford Courant, <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/politics/hc-pol-richard-blumenthal-vietnam-20181001-story.html\">What Did Sen.
