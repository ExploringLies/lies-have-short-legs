Timothy M. Kaine proposed having employees contribute a portion of their salaries toward their pensions as part of an effort to close an anticipated $1.35 billion revenue shortfall in the state&rsquo;s recession-wracked budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell didn&rsquo;t like that idea, as documented on his <a href=\"http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/index.php/press_releases/details/mcdonnell_virginia_must_keep_promise_made_to_current_state_employees/\">campaign website</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The tough fiscal climate...is no excuse for breaking a longstanding commitment to the men and women who have dedicated their careers to the service of Virginia&rsquo;s people&quot; the Republican gubernatorial candidate said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the release, McDonnell noted the state has paid its workers&rsquo; pension contributions since 1983 as a compromise for not offering workers a pay raise that year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The compromise represents a promise made by the Commonwealth to state workers,&quot; McDonnell said. &quot;That promise cannot be broken.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs governor, McDonnell reinforced that commitment in April 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Current state and many local employees took their jobs with the expectation that their retirement contributions would come from their employer,&quot; McDonnell said. &quot;We cannot turn our back on that agreement.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, the General Assembly did require new employees hired after July 1 to pay the 5 percent toward their pensions, but not those working the state before that date. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFast forward to last week when McDonnell announced that he will ask the remaining 86,000 state employees to pay 5 percent of their salaries toward their pensions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s proposal eases the pain by raising pay 3 percent for state employees hired before new retirement rules took effect, meaning the changes would leave them with 2 percent less in take-home pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell said the measure was essential to prop a retirement system underfunded by $17.6 billion. The pension plan, like many public retirement systems, has been hurt by the low investment performance and inadequate support from the state government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA year ago, before McDonnell took office, VRS was underfunded by $11.9 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStacey Johnson, McDonnell&rsquo;s press secretary, acknowledged the governor&rsquo;s position on employee pension contributions has changed since his candidacy. &quot;Since that time, everyone has learned additional, significant details regarding VRS and the need significant new investment in the immediate future,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell last week told reporters, &quot;The system is broken and badly in need of repair. I will not pass on a broken system to another governor.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a noble goal, but a reversal nonetheless.
