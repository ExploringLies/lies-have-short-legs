Marsha Blackburn has repeatedly tied Democrat Phil Bredesen, former Tennessee governor, to loose immigration policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent Blackburn <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iGtlJqdKXb0\">campaign ad</a> told voters that Bredesen &quot;won&rsquo;t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad flashes black and white images of Bredesen&rsquo;s face against a backdrop of a highway packed with cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was Phil Bredesen who, quote, lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee,&quot; a man&rsquo;s voice says in the Oct. 11 ad. &quot;Bredesen lured illegal immigrants hundreds of miles by offering them driver certificates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now, Bredesen opposes President Trump&rsquo;s immigration ban. And Bredesen admits, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the wall is the right answer.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Phil Bredesen. He won&rsquo;t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voiceover closes with shadowy images of young men ascending a ladder or a wall, presumably an illegal border crossing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took a closer look at whether Bredesen &quot;lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Key takeaways</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Between 2001 and 2006, Tennessee went from giving&nbsp;immigrants in the country illegally full driver&#39;s licenses,&nbsp;to giving them driver&#39;s certificates, to giving them nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp; Under a 2004 law, illegal immigrants came from as far away as New Jersey to get certificates &mdash; before returning to their home states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp;In the face of abuses, Bredesen ended the certificate program in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Driver&rsquo;s licenses in Tennessee: A bipartisan history</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The arc of the state&#39;s laws on driving privileges for the undocumented goes from granting them regular driver&#39;s licenses to granting them nothing. Blackburn&#39;s issue with Bredesen deals with a policy adjustment in the middle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, <a href=\"http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB0983&amp;GA=102\">Tennessee passed a law</a> that allowed&nbsp;a person without a Social Security number to get a typical driver&rsquo;s license. The bill had&nbsp;support from most Democratic lawmakers and a bit under half of the Republican ones. Republican Gov. Don Sundquist signed it. Blackburn was a state senator and voted against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bredesen took office in 2003.&nbsp;In 2004, in the middle of a growing demand for tighter identification standards in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks, Bredesen proposed creating a driver&rsquo;s certificate. Anyone without a Social Security number who met the ordinary requirements for a license, such as passing a driver&#39;s test and proof of Tennessee residence, could get one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was billed as a compromise between traffic safety and national security needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Its purpose is to make sure people understand the law and the rules of the road,&quot; said Melissa McDonald, the spokeswoman for the Department of Safety in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/us/immigrants-in-tennessee-issued-certificates-to-drive.html\">2005 New York Times</a> article. &quot;You can&#39;t buy beer with it. You shouldn&#39;t be able to board a plane with it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The driver&rsquo;s certificate card bore the words, &quot;For driving purposes only &mdash; not valid for identification.&quot;&nbsp;Unlike a regular driver&rsquo;s license, a certificate expired after one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB3430&amp;ga=103\">2004 bill</a> passed muster overwhelmingly with both Republicans and Democrats. The vote in the state Senate was 32-0, including 15 Republican senators, and in the House, with 45 Republicans, the vote was 96-2. (By then, Blackburn was in the U.S. Congress.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Abuses uncovered</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The law took effect in June 2004. By October, people began gaming the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one case, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_Y1dEQmttZ2h6c0tGTFkxRlIwTUhtcEJCNXM4\">according to court papers</a>, a woman in Tennessee &quot;transported illegal aliens from New Jersey to Tennessee in order to procure certificates for driving.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She provided them with &quot;hotel rooms while in Tennessee, and documents purporting to show that the aliens had addresses in the state.&quot; The judge in the case wrote that the aliens said &quot;they wanted the licenses so that they could drive to their jobs in New Jersey.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the immigrants went after they had their certificates has some bearing here. Watching Blackburn&rsquo;s ad, you might think that the program attracted them to Tennessee to live. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be what happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attorney Mike Whalen represented the women who brought in immigrants from New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To the best of my understanding, none of these folks stayed in Tennessee,&quot; Whalen said. &quot;I speak Spanish, so I represent lots of folks who are undocumented. Never saw it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A larger scam operated out of a private driving school in Winchester, Tenn. Investigators discovered a scheme where people at the driving school bribed state workers to provide both licenses and certificates for undocumented immigrants. Officials said hundreds of illegal immigrants were directed to the school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &quot;lure&quot; comes from an <a href=\"https://www.policeone.com/archive/articles/122779-Tennessees-driver-certificates-lure-illegal-immigrants-from-other-states/\">Associated Press headline</a> about the investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Certificate program ends</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As federal and state law enforcement began arresting and charging people in late 2005 and early 2006, Bredesen shut down the certificate program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s clear from talks with law enforcement authorities that there are issues with this program that need to be addressed,&quot; Bredesen <a href=\"http://heraldnewstn.com/2006/03/page/119/\">said in March 2006</a>. &quot;The only responsible course of action is to suspend the program while we determine the next steps.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen Fotopulos was policy director with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition in 2006. Fotopulos said his advocacy group tried to preserve the program by making it more rigorous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For months we worked with Department of Safety to change the process of getting a driver&#39;s certificate to make sure that only people in Tennessee would get it,&quot; Fotopulos told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=HB1827&amp;ga=105\">in 2007</a>, the Legislature passed and Bredesen signed the full termination of the program. With about 10 Democrats dissenting, the measure passed by wide majorities in both the House and Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Blackburn said that Bredesen &quot;lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee&quot; by offering a driver&rsquo;s certificate for the undocumented. The one accurate part of the claim is that people came from out of state and fraudulently applied for both certificates and full driver&#39;s licenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, the claim begins to break down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bredesen swapped a more lenient licensing law signed by his Republican predecessor for a less useful certificate that could not serve as official identification and lasted for only a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To pin the law to Bredesen ignores that nearly every Republican lawmaker approved that change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When problems surfaced, Bredesen preempted the Legislature and ended the program by executive action. The next year, Republicans and most Democrats voted to affirm that move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, the ad strongly implies that Bredesent sought to have illegal immigrants stay in Tennessee. There is no evidence for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-10-25T16:11:18.638728", "ruling_date": "2018-10-25T17:22:41", "ruling_headline": "Marsha Blackburn falsely says Phil Bredesen lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee", "ruling_headline_slug": "marsha-blackburn-falsely-says-phil-bredesen-lured-", "ruling_link_text": "Lured away from the facts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Marsha Blackburn, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iGtlJqdKXb0\">Luring</a>, Oct. 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tennessee General Assembly, <a href=\"http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB0983&amp;GA=102\">HB 0983 Authorizes person without social security number to receive driver license</a>, May 15, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tennessee General Assembly, <a href=\"http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/Billinfo/default.aspx?BillNumber=SB3430&amp;ga=103\">SB 3430 Establishing certificate of driving</a>, June 4, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Book of the States, <a href=\"https://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/system/files/2000_table_3.3.pdf\">State legislatures 2000</a>, 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Tennessee County Technical Assistance Service, <a href=\"http://www.ctas.tennessee.edu/content/2004-index-acts\">Certificate for driving</a>, May 28, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Tennessee County Technical Assistance Service, <a href=\"http://www.ctas.tennessee.edu/content/2007-index-acts\">Issuance of Driver Licenses</a>, May 21, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_Y1dEQmttZ2h6c0tGTFkxRlIwTUhtcEJCNXM4\">United States of America v.
