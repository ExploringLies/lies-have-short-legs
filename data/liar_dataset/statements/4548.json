But, that is potentially important. The state money to local schools was cut, but many districts were able to use the new freedom from union contracts to cut their own budgets to recover some or even all of the lost state aid. That limited the overall negative impact on the classroom.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3569\">The </a><a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3569\">study </a>is ongoing, as the group is trying to gather information from the remaining 26 states. For those states, the information was not yet available or there were other obstacles to crunching the numbers, said Phil Oliff, a policy analyst who co-authored the study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study found that Wisconsin had plenty of company in cutting aid for 2011-12 over the previous year -- 21 of the 24 states have cut per-student funding to some degree.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study noted: &quot;Some of the deepest reductions to K-12 formula funding since the onset of the recession have occurred in the past year, as federal aid intended to sustain state education spending has expired, rainy day funds have been exhausted, and states have resisted raising additional taxes to offset the need for cuts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt ranked Wisconsin&rsquo;s cuts as third deepest in percent change in spending per student (10.0%). The study highlighted this finding: &quot;Of the states surveyed, the three states that reduced per student funding the most since last year are Illinois, Texas, and Wisconsin.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it&rsquo;s a poor ranking, to be sure. But that&rsquo;s not Number 1.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy another measure, Wisconsin was Number 1 -- the dollar change per student (-$635). This was covered in a chart in the study and that is what drew the headlines -- and Miller&rsquo;s attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOliff told us that both measures were useful, just from different perspectives. A prominent Wisconsin education funding researcher who reviewed the group&rsquo;s numbers, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Andrew Reschovsky, agreed both measures are important.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The bottom line is Wisconsin has made very deep cuts, either year over year or compared to pre-recession (levels),&quot; Oliff told us. &quot;Some of the deepest cuts in the nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Reschovsky how he would characterize Wisconsin&rsquo;s rankings based on the study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;d be comfortable saying that among the 24 states they studied, and focusing only on aid, Wisconsin has cut state aid more dramatically than most of those other states,&quot; Reschovsky said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&#39;s some of the deepest cuts, and deeper than most other states, but not <em>the</em> deepest.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/129317268.html\">Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/129317268.html\">story </a>on Sept. 6, 2011 led with &quot;Wisconsin leads the country so far this year in cuts to state aid for schools&quot; -- but immediately noted the study was limited to 24 states. The story also noted the #3 ranking on the other measure. The headline was less specific: &quot;Wisconsin ranks high in school aid cuts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/education/blog/article_f4f6e008-d848-11e0-a158-001cc4c03286.html\">Capital Times </a><a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/education/blog/article_f4f6e008-d848-11e0-a158-001cc4c03286.html\">piece </a>the same day led with the dollar change (#1) under this headline: &quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s cuts to school aid steepest of 24 states studied.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next day, the <a href=\"http://www.wrn.com/2011/09/wisconsin-k-12-funding-cuts-lead-the-nation/\">Wisconsin Radio Network&rsquo;s </a><a href=\"http://www.wrn.com/2011/09/wisconsin-k-12-funding-cuts-lead-the-nation/\">website </a>said: &quot;Wisconsin K-12 funding cuts lead the nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe WRN story led off: &quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s cuts to school aid are the deepest among 24 states where budget information is available, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike the others, it also prominently noted the limits of the study -- 26 states are not included.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Miller&rsquo;s office how he could say the cuts were the most drastic &quot;of any state&quot; when the study looked at only 24 states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiller spokesman Michael Browne told us that by saying &quot;Republicans enacted&quot; the deepest cuts, Miller had provided listeners with the appropriate context. &quot;Enacted&quot; signals that Miller was talking about the deepest cuts just among those states that had acted, Browne argued.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that doesn&rsquo;t square with why the study was limited to 24 states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome others have acted, but the data is just not available or has not been analyzed. And it&rsquo;s reasonable to think some or many have cut education funding, said Oliff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiller took to the airwaves to say that &quot;Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation.&quot;&nbsp; He cited media reports concerning a study by a liberal think tank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResearchers we consulted poked no holes in the study, but it only covered about half the states. And while Wisconsin did indeed lead in cuts by one measure, it was third according to a second measure that is highlighted in the group&rsquo;s report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s an element of truth in Miller&rsquo;s claim, but he pushed past the limits of the study.
