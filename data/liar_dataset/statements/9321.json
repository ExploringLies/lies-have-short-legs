How often have most Americans agreed on any one thing for nearly 70 years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And more specifically, has a majority of Americans supported single-payer -- or &quot;Medicare for all,&quot; as Nader also referred to it -- dating back to the presidency of Harry Truman (1945-&rsquo;53)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Single-payer and politicians</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under single-payer, private insurers would be eliminated, although private medical providers would remain. Everyone would get health coverage from the government and government would pay all the bills. In that sense, it&rsquo;s like Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older and certain younger people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Single-payer received mention in the debate during the run-up to Obamacare, which became law in 2010. But even some of its most prominent supporters have wavered on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Obama earned a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/barack-obama/obama-statements-single-payer-have-changed-bit/\"><u>Half Flip</u></a> on PolitiFact&rsquo;s Flip-O-Meter. Compared to his earlier years in politics, Obama had moderated his statements in support of single-payer as he tried to appeal to a wider audience, our PolitiFact National colleagues found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, after Republican former Gov. Tommy Thompson <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/26/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-us-senate-rival-tammy-baldwin-/\"><u>made single-payer an issue</u></a> in the 2012 race for a U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin, we gave a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/01/tammy-baldwin/single-payer-healthcare-system-america/\"><u>Half-Flip</u></a> to Democrat Tammy Baldwin. Just before she defeated Thompson, Baldwin deflected questions about single-payer and said she was setting aside at least temporarily her efforts toward getting single-payer in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nader&rsquo;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his part, Nader -- who won <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2000\"><u>2.74 percent</u></a> of the vote in the razor-thin 2000 presidential race -- cited through a spokesman portions of three articles to back his claim about the public&rsquo;s support for the concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of the articles constitute evidence that most Americans have backed single-payer over the past seven decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 1982 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, citing polls, argued that most Americans believed there was a &quot;need for national health insurance and that it would require larger government intervention.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447696/\"><u>2003 article</u></a> in the American Journal of Public Health said public opinion generally ran in favor of health care reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a <a href=\"http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7871.pdf\"><u>2009 article</u></a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely recognized authority on health care, said polls as far back as the 1930s show Americans have generally supported &quot;the goals of guaranteed access to health care and health insurance for all, as well as a government role in health financing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know more about what polls have shown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The polls</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/archive/health_care_update_archive/april_2014/37_favor_single_payer_health_care_system\"><u>Rasmussen Reports poll</u></a> in April 2014 found that only 37 percent of Americans favored single-payer. And although the proposal has largely been out of the public debate since before Obamacare became law, earlier polling also didn&rsquo;t find clear support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, with the Obamacare bill being pushed in Congress, filmmaker Michael Moore said a majority of Americans favored a single-payer system. PolitiFact National rated his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-majority-favor-single-payer-h/\"><u>False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polls had consistently shown that a majority of Americans wanted some form of universal health care coverage &mdash; they want uninsured people to have insurance -- but there was wide disagreement about how to do that. For example, some people supported keeping the current the system, but with tax credits to help uninsured people buy private insurance, while others backed requiring employers to provide employee health insurance, or to pay into a government fund that would pay to cover those without insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, not majority support for a government-run health insurance system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a longer view of the polling, we contacted two polling experts: <a href=\"http://kff.org/person/liz-hamel/\"><u>Liz Hamel</u></a>, the Kaiser foundation&rsquo;s public opinion and survey research director; and <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholar/karlyn-bowman/#mbl\"><u>Karlyn Bowman</u></a>, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7990.pdf\"><u>latest poll</u></a> on single-payer, in September 2009, found that less than a majority of Americans -- 40 percent -- favored single-payer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, seven other ways to expand health insurance coverage -- such as expanding Medicare or instituting an individual mandate requiring all Americans to have coverage -- &nbsp;all received higher levels of support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years earlier, a <a href=\"http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7572.pdf\"><u>2006 Kaiser poll</u></a> indicated possible majority support for single-payer -- but it was constructed as a limited either-or question:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Which would you prefer -- the current health insurance system in the United States, in which most people get their health insurance from private employers, but some people have no insurance; or, a universal health insurance program, in which everyone is covered under a program like Medicare that&#39;s run by the government and financed by taxpayers?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fifty-six percent said they preferred a universal system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going back further, however, there was no such majority support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, two directors of the <a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/horp/people/\"><u>Harvard Opinion Research Program</u></a> <a href=\"http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/20/2/33.long\"><u>reviewed</u></a> more than 100 public opinion polls over a 50-year period. One key conclusion was that &nbsp;&quot;most Americans remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right and do not favor a single-payer type of national health plan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that it covered much of the period Nader referred to, that article is strong evidence refuting his claim. But we were curious about polling going back to the start of Truman&#39;s presidency. The results were mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two examples from that period:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On an either-or Gallup poll question in 1945, 53 percent said they favored &quot;a plan set up by the government which would require every person to take part,&quot; while 34 percent preferred a voluntary plan &quot;set up by the medical profession&quot; and 13 percent had no opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when asked this question in 1949 -- &quot;Should the U.S. Congress pass the government&#39;s compulsory health insurance program, which would require wage or salary deductions from all employed persons to provide medical and hospital care for them and their families?&quot; -- the results were: Yes, 44 percent; No, 47 percent; No opinion, 9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nader said a majority of Americans &quot;since Harry Truman days&quot; support single-payer health insurance, or &quot;full Medicare for all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are individual poll results dating back to 1945 that indicate majority support for single-payer, overall the results are mixed, at best. In fact, one review of more than 100 polls over 50 years found that most people opposed single-payer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-ralph-nader-claim-on-support-for-single-payer-since-truman-b99269504z1-259126261.html?page=1\">website</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-13T16:59:29.798999", "ruling_date": "2014-05-14T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "For 70 years, most Americans have supported single-payer government-run health insurance?", "ruling_headline_slug": "70-years-most-americans-have-supported-single-paye", "ruling_link_text": "That\u2019s not what polls show", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Public Radio, Joy Cardin <a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/listen/574691\"><u>interview</u></a> of Ralph Nader, May 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Ralph Nader spokesman John Richard, May 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Kaiser Family Foundation public opinion and survey research director <a href=\"http://kff.org/person/liz-hamel/\"><u>Liz Hamel</u></a>, May 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, American Enterprise Institute senior fellow <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholar/karlyn-bowman/#mbl\"><u>Karlyn Bowman</u></a>, May 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-majority-favor-single-payer-h/\"><u>&quot;Michael Moore claims a majority favor a single-payer health care system,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 1, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/01/tammy-baldwin/single-payer-healthcare-system-america/\"><u>&quot;Looking at Baldwin and a single-payer health care system for America,&quot;</u></a> Nov. 1, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/26/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-us-senate-rival-tammy-baldwin-/\"><u>&quot;Tommy Thompson says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin wants to go &lsquo;far beyond Obamacare,&rsquo;&quot;</u></a> Aug. 26, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7871.pdf\"><u>&quot;National health insurance: A brief history of reform efforts in the U.S.,&quot;</u></a> March 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7572.pdf\"><u>&quot;Health Care in America 2006 Survey,&quot;</u></a> October 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Journal of Public Health, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447696/\"><u>&quot;Health care reform and social movements in the United States,&quot;</u></a> January 2003</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health Affairs, <a href=\"http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/20/2/33.long\"><u>&quot;Americans&rsquo;
