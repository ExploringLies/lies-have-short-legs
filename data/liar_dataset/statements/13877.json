Currently, 28 countries (including the United States and Germany) are members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members agreed that &quot;an armed attack against one or more of them &hellip; shall be considered an attack against them all&quot; and that following such an attack, each member would take &quot;such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We never heard back from Trump&rsquo;s team about what money Germany owes. But Trump likely was alluding to the fact Germany has not yet met the NATO target commitment for overall defense funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 2014, NATO&rsquo;s collective agreement directed members to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending by 2024. According to <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_142152.htm\">NATO</a>, only five counties meet that obligation today: the United States, Greece, Estonia, Poland and the United Kingdom. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see from the graphic above, Germany only pays 1.2 percent of their GDP on defense spending. German leaders have said <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-military-idUSKBN1522UG\">they intend to boost military spending</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem with Trump&rsquo;s claim, however, is that Germany doesn&rsquo;t pay that money to NATO or the United States or any other country, said Daniel Benjamin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(Germany) has, like many members, fallen short of its commitments, which is obviously not good,&quot; Benjamin said. &quot;But there is no central bank this money goes into, and there is no transaction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other experts we consulted agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States decides what level of military spending it wants to have, as do all other NATO &nbsp;members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The relatively low levels of military spending among U.S. allies is completely rational,&quot; said Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. &quot;They don&#39;t see a pressing need to spend more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s argument that the United States needs to be paid more also misrepresents how NATO works, experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Trump seems to represent the NATO alliance as a licensing deal &mdash; one in which countries like Germany pay the United States for its power and influence,&quot; said Laicie Heeley, a military budget expert at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank. &quot;This is not the case.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States does provide&nbsp;an outsized military commitment to NATO, but this is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvoHDaalder/status/843105839091273728\">not done as a favor for Europe</a>; it&rsquo;s done to benefit all countries in the alliance, experts said. And the United States has several high-profile military bases in Germany that are vital, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-most-important-us-air-force-base-youve-never-heard-of/\">serving as a key launching point for attacks against terrorists in the Middle East</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Germany &quot;owes vast sums of money to NATO&quot; and the United States &quot;must be paid more&quot; for the defense it provides to Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of their country&rsquo;s GDP on defense by 2024. But that&rsquo;s not in payments to NATO. Each country funds its own defense, while NATO serves as an umbrella organization meant to protect all members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts say Trump is mistaken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-03-19T13:24:24.616704", "ruling_date": "2017-03-19T16:20:36", "ruling_headline": "Fact-check: Donald Trump says Germany owes 'vast sums of money to NATO'", "ruling_headline_slug": "fact-check-donald-trump-says-germany-owes-vast-sum", "ruling_link_text": "That's not how NATO works", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email, Steven Cheung, White House spokesperson, March 19</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Jeremy Shapiro, research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations at &nbsp;Brookings, March 19</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Stephen M.
