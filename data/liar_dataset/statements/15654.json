We wondered whether Kavanaugh had indeed ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. Largely, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The bureau has stirred controversy from the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren was an early advocate for the CFPB and was considered the likely first head until a potential appointment was opposed by Republicans in Congress. Obama&rsquo;s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office, until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a recess appointment. Cordray was later confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (Cordray is now running for governor in Ohio.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. The bureau&rsquo;s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve and does not require congressional approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CFPB is headed by a single director with a five-year term who cannot be fired at will. The president may only remove the director for &quot;inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,&quot; according to the law that established it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">What Kavanaugh said</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After CFPB imposed a $109 million fine on PHH Corp., the New Jersey mortgage service provider sued, challenging the constitutionality of the CFPB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, the D.C. <a href=\"http://www.housingwire.com/articles/38252-phh-wins-landmark-victory-cfpb-ruled-unconstitutional\">Court of Appeals </a>sided with the company and cleared the fine. Kavanaugh, one of the three judges, wrote the opinion. Kavanaugh wrote that the CFPB is &quot;unconstitutionally structured.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure, Kavanaugh argued, gives the CFPB director more unilateral authority than anyone in the government besides the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to remedy the constitutional flaw, Kavanaugh wrote, Supreme Court precedent dictates a &quot;narrower remedy&quot; than shutting down the entire CFPB. Kavanaugh suggested allowing the president to supervise, direct and fire the director at will. That&rsquo;s not exactly the same thing as finding the CFPB itself to be unconstitutional, but it&rsquo;s close, law experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A later decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld CFPB&rsquo;s constitutionality. The question could still come to the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aaron Klein, the policy director at Brookings Institution&rsquo;s Center on Regulations and Markets, said that tying CFPB directly to the president, and thus election cycles, could curb its intended independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Reducing the independence of any financial regulator is likely to make them pursue less politically unpopular activities, like reining in credit practices during good times,&quot; &nbsp;he said. &quot;That&rsquo;s why financial regulation tends to only pass Congress after crises, and as the memory of the crisis fades, deregulation comes in.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Klobuchar said Kavanaugh &quot;ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a three judge panel of the D.C. Circuit finding the CFPB structurally unconstitutional. The issue lay in the bureau&rsquo;s leadership structure, not the bureau itself. That said, a change to its leadership structure could rein in the regulatory activities CFPB performs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-07-25T13:02:27.597839", "ruling_date": "2018-07-25T15:40:09", "ruling_headline": "Brett Kavanaugh ruled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau structurally unconstitutional", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-brett-kavanaugh-scotus-cfpb-unconstitutional", "ruling_link_text": "Structure unconstitutional", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CADC.USCourts.gov, <a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/AAC6BFFC4C42614C852580490053C38B/%24file/15-1177-1640101.pdf\">PHH Corporation vs. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, Oct. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vox, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/11/17556120/brett-kavanaugh-elizabeth-warren-cfpb-regulations\">Consumer advocacy groups are extremely worried about Brett Kavanaugh</a>, July 11, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/1016501082040819713?lang=en\">Amy Klobuchar</a>, July 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1016730494506012673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1016730494506012673&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fpolicy-and-politics%2F2018%2F7%2F11%2F17556120%2Fbrett-kavanaugh-elizabeth-warren-cfpb-regulations\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, July 10, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Kirsten Hartman, Klobuchar spokeswoman, July 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Aaron Klein, policy director at Brooking Institution&rsquo;s Center on Regulations and Markets, July 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Saikrishna Prakash, professor at University of Virginia School of Law, July 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sarah Duggin, professor at Columbus School of Law, July 24, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Brenden D.
