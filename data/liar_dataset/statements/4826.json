Steve Rothman. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Currently it costs more than a penny for the U.S. Mint to make a one cent coin and more than a nickel to make the five cent piece,&quot; Rothman (D-9th Dist.) said in a statement submitted to the Congressional Record on Nov. 2. Rothman&rsquo;s statement called attention to an opinion article in the New York Times written by a Bergen County freeholder that suggested alternate materials &nbsp;for penny production.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found the congressman is right on the money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe total cost to produce and distribute a penny in 2010 was 1.79 cents, according to the U.S. Mint&rsquo;s most recent annual report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA nickel cost the government 9.22 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, the U.S. Mint lost &nbsp;$42.6 million on the more than 3.48 billion pennies and 359 million nickels produced and distributed in fiscal year 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe government has been losing money on producing these smaller denomination coins since 2006, when a rise in the price of the metals used to make the coins increased the overall production costs, according to annual reports.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Mint&rsquo;s most recent annual report said that &quot;changing the composition of coins to less expensive alternative materials could generate significant cost savings.&quot; The composition of the penny and nickel is set by statute.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In 1982, the penny composition changed from copper alloy (95% copper, 5% zinc) to copper plated zinc (total content 97.5% zinc, 2.5% copper),&quot; Gordon Hume, a spokesman for the U.S. Mint told us in an email. &quot;The nickel has remained unchanged since 1866 at 75% copper, 25% nickel. The only exception was from 1942 to 1945 when the nickel was 56% copper, 35% silver, 9% manganese.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis summer the Mint contracted Concurrent Technologies Corporation, a Johnstown, Pa.-based company, to research and recommend less expensive metallic materials for coin production.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that while the U.S. Mint is losing money on pennies and nickels, it&rsquo;s still turning a profit on higher denomination coins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, dimes cost 5.69 cents to produce and distribute, quarters cost 12.78 cents and dollar coins went for 31.57 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRothman claimed it costs more for the U.S. Mint to produce a penny and nickel than the face value of the coins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt costs 1.79 cents to produce and distribute every penny the Mint makes. And every nickel costs 9.22 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, you can bank on those numbers.
