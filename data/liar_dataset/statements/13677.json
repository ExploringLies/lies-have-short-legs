The posts were flagged as being potentially fabricated by Facebook, as part of its efforts to crack down on made-up Internet posts masquerading as true information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This one, keyed off Streep&rsquo;s acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding achievement at the <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2017/01/2017-golden-globes-meryl-streep-cecil-b-demille-award-lifetime-achievement-1201881038/\">Golden Globes on Jan. 8</a>, is as fictional as any Hollywood creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Streep did excoriate then-President-elect Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/watch-meryl-streep-accept-cecil-b-demille-award-golden-globes-2017-961510\">policies and past actions in her speech</a>, without ever mentioning his name. She said she was stunned when Trump imitated a disabled reporter, a claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wrong-say-he-moc/\">Trump has falsely denied</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump took to Twitter the next day to lambast Streep for criticizing him, calling her &quot;over-rated&quot; and a &quot;Hillary flunky,&quot; again denying he mocked a reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The fake blog posts claim Streep&rsquo;s speech was enough for Ron Howard to kick her off a reboot of the TV show <em>Happy Days</em>. That&rsquo;s odd on its own, because Howard took to Twitter himself to chide Trump and defend Streep&rsquo;s freedom of speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The article is pretty light on most details, such as whether this was to be a TV series or a film, but Streep was allegedly going to play Mrs. Cunningham. Plenty of passages in the fake story &mdash; such as saying Streep &quot;hasn&rsquo;t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes&quot; &mdash; hint that this is an attempt at humor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story appears to have first appeared on a <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-meryl-streep-just-got-fired-from-a-major-project-for-lying-about-trump/\">Jan. 9 post</a> on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that describes itself as being opposed to President Barack Obama and &quot;whiny politically correct liberal masses.&quot; We therefore don&rsquo;t suspect they were fans of Florence Foster Jenkins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://thelastlineofdefense.org/about-us/\">&quot;About Us&quot; portion of their site reads</a>, &quot;All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.&quot; But this disclaimer isn&rsquo;t obvious on the story itself, and certainly isn&rsquo;t apparent reading other websites to which the post was shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For fans of the Fonz, we must also note that the suggestion of a <em>Happy Days</em> reboot (with or without Streep) also appears fake. There has been no verified report of any kind of reboot of<em> Happy Days</em>.
