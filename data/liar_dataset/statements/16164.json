The &quot;cuts&quot; Evers alleges come from comparing actual funding in the following two years to what funding would have been if it remained at that $5.27 billion level annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GPR school aids dropped by $426.5 million in 2011-&rsquo;12 and then rose by $68.9 million in 2012-&rsquo;13. Taken together, that reduced school aid by $784.1 million in the two-year budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s in the ballpark of Evers&rsquo; claim, but it leaves out a lot of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The missing pieces</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s critical to note the 2011-&rsquo;12 funding reduction did not happen in isolation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 10, enacted in 2011, required public employees to pay more toward their pensions and decreased their collective bargaining power. That allowed schools to save money that would have gone toward employee pensions and to charge employees more for health insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When all districts were tallied in 2012, they spent $451.5 million less on employee benefits than in 2011, according to a study by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, now the Wisconsin Policy Forum. In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million less than in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So across the two years where state funding was cut by nearly $800 million, school districts saved nearly $900 million in benefits. And that savings would be higher if you assume costs would have continued to rise from the 2011 levels (likely about 4.3 percent per year, according to the study).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important factor: The Evers ad does not say it is referring to a funding change made more than five years ago in a single budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, viewers might assume school spending is $800 million less today than when Walker began. In reality, after the initial cuts, Walker has increased GPR school aids every year, hitting a high of $5.84 billion this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s above the last year of Doyle&rsquo;s term, though that doesn&rsquo;t account for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those increases mean most of that $784 million in cuts has been returned to the budget. The right-hand column of the chart shows the difference between actual funding and what it would have been cumulatively if the schools budget remained $5.27 billion every year since 2011. That gap was more than $1 billion at one point but now is down to $183.6 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools. He did cut close to that ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that ignores changes made through Walker&rsquo;s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the ad does not make clear that it&rsquo;s referring only to cuts from 2011-&rsquo;13, so viewers wouldn&rsquo;t know that subsequent funding increases have made up most of that reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our definition for Mostly False is &quot;The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That fits here.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-11-02T12:35:25.154000", "ruling_date": "2018-11-02T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrat Tony Evers misfires on education spending claim against Republican Scott Walker", "ruling_headline_slug": "democrat-tony-evers-misfires-education-spending-cl", "ruling_link_text": " Increases made up most of reductions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, Tony Evers campaign,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAsU-MeP8w&amp;feature=youtu.be\"> Every Kid</a>, Sept. 25, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Russ Kava, fiscal analyst, Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Nov. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin,<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/20/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-union-reform-law-brought-massive/\"> Scott Walker says union reform law that brought massive protests has saved taxpayers $3 billion</a>, Aug. 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin,<a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/20/tony-evers/did-scott-walker-take-1-billion-wisconsin-schools-/\"> Did Scott Walker take $1 billion from Wisconsin schools, as governor candidate Tony Evers claims?</a>, April 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Sam Lau, spokesman for Tony Evers campaign, Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, The Wisconsin Taxpayer &ndash; Gauging Wisconsin&rsquo;s 2013 Taxes, November 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Tony", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 2350, "last_name": "Evers", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "tony-evers", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 14, "party": "State official", "party_slug": "state-official", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/14/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Tony_Evers__PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2350/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Scott Walker &lsquo;cut $800 million from our schools.&rsquo;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign ad", "statement_date": "2018-09-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 326, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/326/", "subject": "State government spending ", "subject_slug": "state-government-spending", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/61/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Evers says Walker 'cut $800 million from our schools'"}
