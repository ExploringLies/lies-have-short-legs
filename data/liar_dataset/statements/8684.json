But the actual level of support in the poll was 39 percent -- not the 30 percent listed in the Facebook post. The error cut the amount of support by about one-quarter -- not a trivial amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turned out, the error was simply a typo; the <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/news/research/democrats-polling-drops/?utm_content=kanderson@rnchq.org&amp;utm_source=VerticalResponse&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_term=View%20This%20Briefing%20In%20Your%20Browser&amp;utm_campaign=Down%20Through%20The%20Chimney%20Democrats%E2%80%99%20Polling%20Dropscontent\"><u>supporting material</u></a> cited in the RNC&rsquo;s Facebook post had the correct number -- 39 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we brought this to the RNC&rsquo;s attention, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski wrote back, &quot;Yes, this was a typo and we are fixing it right now.&quot; True to her word, the Facebook post was corrected within an hour or so. (We&rsquo;ve posted a before-and-after look at right.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the 57 percent in opposition was correct, but the actual level of support was 39 percent. Once we notified the RNC of this error, they quickly fixed it. Because one number was wrong in the original post and one was right, we rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-18T16:07:20.831611", "ruling_date": "2013-12-19T11:57:52", "ruling_headline": "RNC offered wrong poll figure for Obama support", "ruling_headline_slug": "rnc-posts-wrong-poll-figure-obama-support-quickly-", "ruling_link_text": "Readers caught a wrong number", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Republican National Committee, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GOP#!/photo.php?fbid=10152081050520090&amp;set=a.419575980089.216069.123192635089&amp;type=1\"><u>Facebook post</u></a>, Dec. 14, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quinnipiac poll, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1988\"><u>December 11, 2013 - Keep Cell Phones Off Planes, American Voters Say 2-1, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; More People Spending Less On Holiday Gifts</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, Dec. 18, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "", "id": 22, "last_name": "Republican National Committee", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "republican-national-committee-republican", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-rnc_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/22/", "total_count": 34, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The latest Quinnipiac poll found that nearly six-in-ten Americans oppose ObamaCare -- 30% support the law and 57% oppose it.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Facebook post", "statement_date": "2013-12-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
