The pay raise, based on a formula, is automatically included in appropriations bills unless Congress takes a vote to stop it. The law -- even if it had the best of intentions -- created a system where members of Congress receive raises without having to be on-record voting for them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat does exist though, are roll call votes on whether members of Congress were willing to hear amendments to suspend their pay increases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMembers of Congress <a href=\"http://housepressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries\">have seen their pay increase over time</a>.

By doing so, the House rejected Rep. Jim Matheson, D-UT&#39;s procedural attempt to get a direct vote on the pay raise. Congress received a pay adjustment of 2.5 percent in January 2005, increasing their salary $4,000 to $162,100.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only House member to speak out against the automatic raise in 2003 or 2004, according to <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132386,00.html\">Fox News</a>, &nbsp;was Rep. Matheson. &quot;Now is not the time for members of Congress to be voting themselves a pay raise,&quot; Matheson said. &quot;Let us send a signal to the American people that we recognize their struggle in America&#39;s economy.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2005:</strong> On June 28, 2005, the House voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll327.xml\">263-152</a>with Bass in the majority, on ordering the previous question to again essentially stop Matheson from introducing a measure to block the pay raise. The vote was on House Resolution 342, which related to H.R. 3058, an appropriations bill for transportation and other areas. Congress <a href=\"http://political-stuff.blogspot.com/2005/06/house-agrees-to-3100-pay-raise-for.html\">would receive</a>&nbsp;a $3,100 pay raise, bringing their salary to $165,200.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlyson Heyrend, Matheson&#39;s spokesperson, explained the procedural move.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Matheson each year sought a &#39;no&#39; vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question,&quot; she told PolitiFact in an e-mail. &quot;Had a majority voted &#39;no&#39; he would have then offered his amendment to deny the annual Congressional pay raise. The process is designed to be obscure -- which is Matheson&rsquo;s primary concern -- that the public isn&#39;t able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2006:</strong> On June 13, 2006, the House took a similar vote -- this time <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll261.xml\">249-167</a>&nbsp;with Bass in the majority -- on ordering the previous question which again halted Matheson&#39;s attempt for an up-or-down vote. The vote was on House Resolution 865, which related to H.R. 5576, an appropriations bill. The result: members would receive a $3,300 pay raise increasing their salaries to $168,500.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut then campaign season kicked in. Democrats vowed not to accept the 2007 pay raise until Congress approved an increase to the minimum wage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn. <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d109:1:./temp/%7EbdtsMu:@@@X%7C/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=109%7C\">Dec. 8, 2006</a>, the House voted <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll540.xml\">370-20 with Bass in the majority</a>&nbsp;or a stopgap funding measure H.J. 102 until mid February 2007 -- delaying the pay raises. Democrats had planned to offer an amendment to delay the congressional pay raise, so &quot;House GOP leaders decided to include language deferring the pay raise in the bill, taking away the Democrats&#39; ability to make it an issue,&quot;Congressional Quarterly Today wrote in an article we found in Nexis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, did Bass vote to increase his own pay here? Not exactly, his spokesman says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Kuster continually cites procedural votes that have nothing to do with pay raises beyond what certain Members of Congress said they intended to do if this procedural vote failed to move the underlying bill along the House floor process,&quot; said Scott Tranchemontagne, a spokesman for Bass&rsquo; &quot;Victory Committee,&quot; in an email to PolitiFact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;However, that same argument could be applied to any issue that was not addressed in the underlying legislation being considered at the time. It&rsquo;s parliamentary shenanigans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tranchemontagne added that Bass has voted for extended freezes to congressional pay several times, including recently, with <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll019.xml\">H. Res. 3835</a>&nbsp;and &nbsp;<a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll579.xml\">H.J.

Res. 3630</a>-- which would prohibit any pay adjustment for Congress prior to December 31, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Congress has essentially built a system that allows for pay raises without direct votes by its members, it&rsquo;s difficult to say who voted for the raises, which were a tiny part of much larger appropriation bills. What can be seen are votes on procedural moves to block the pay raises, or force an up or down vote. Still, Kuster is exaggerating to cite these eight votes to say Bass voted to raise his own pay, because the votes didn&rsquo;t do that on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Bass cast procedural votes that effectively allowed automatic pay raises to stand for eight years, and the practical effect of those votes meant Bass saw raises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Kuster left out the fact that Bass has voted for pay freezes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To us, the two caveats amount to a Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-28T18:00:05.580569", "ruling_date": "2012-09-28T17:57:39", "ruling_headline": "Ann McLane Kuster off the mark on Charlie Bass salary claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "ann-mclane-kuster-mark-charlie-bass-salary-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Obscured by proceedure", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;Congressman Bass&rsquo; Hypocrisy on Congressional Pay,&quot; Kuster campaign press release, emailed to the press Sept. 19, 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmail correspondence with Kuster Campaign Manager Garrick Delzell, Sept. 20, 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Library of Congress, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll261.xml\">Roll Call 261 on H.
