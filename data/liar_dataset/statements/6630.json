I don&#39;t think Gov. Romney meant any harm. I think he&#39;s a good guy. He just has no idea how good he&#39;s had it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Castro accurately recap Romney&rsquo;s student advice?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to news accounts, Romney visited<a href=\"http://www.otterbein.edu/\"> Otterbein University</a> in Westerville, Ohio (northeast of Columbus) on April 27, 2012. And, as<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/romney-to-college-students-pursue-your-dreams-even-if-you-have-to-borrow-to-do-so/2012/04/27/gIQAFGM8lT_blog.html\"> reported at the time</a> by <em>The Washington Post</em> and other news organizations, the candidate told an auditorium full of students and faculty that Obama&rsquo;s policies had amounted to an attack on success and on those who aspire to be successful.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;This kind of divisiveness, this attack on success,&quot; Romney was reported as saying, &quot;is very different than what we&rsquo;ve seen in our country&rsquo;s history. We&rsquo;ve always encouraged young people, take &mdash; take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked his quoted comments against a<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74RjhYyaDLc&amp;feature=relmfu\"> video taken</a> of his 35-minute speech by<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/OhioCapitalBlog\"> Marc Kovac</a>, an Ohio reporter for Dix Newspapers. It shows his exhortation occurred toward the end of a presentation otherwise lacing Romney&#39;s criticism of Obama&rsquo;s stewardship of the economy with vows to spur the economy and unite the country.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut was Romney recommending borrowing money from parents to start a business or to pay for an education or both? His wording and delivery didn&rsquo;t make it clear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, the <em>National Journal</em>&rsquo;s report on the speech said that Romney reported that Romney &quot;offered a group of college students this advice: If you want to get an education or start a business, borrow money from your parents.&quot; An aide to Romney clarified later that Romney said he was referring to business loans when he suggested students borrow money from their parents,&quot; and not, the wording indicates, borrowing to go to college. The <em>National Journal</em> amended its story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn any event, Romney followed his remark at Otterbein U. by citing the example of sandwich chain Jimmy John&rsquo;s, which owner Jimmy John Liautaud launched by borrowing $20,000 from his father (in return for 48 percent of the business) to start the shop, the <em>Post</em> and<a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-04-28/news/31453681_1_mitt-romney-president-obama-jimmy-john-liautaud\"> <em>New York Daily News</em></a> reported. The <em>Post</em> account says: &quot;Liautaud&rsquo;s father had made the loan on the condition that if his son wasn&rsquo;t able to return the money, with interest, within a year, he would have to join the Army.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney told the audience that Liautaud&rsquo;s &quot;sandwiches are doing pretty well. He&rsquo;s got shops all over the country and thousands of people who work with him. This is kind of an American experience.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked about Castro&rsquo;s claim, Romney campaign spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that cherry-picking one statement from one speech, &quot;a national policy does not make.&quot; Romney, Walker said, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blogs/mitts-view/2012/08/mitt-romneys-plan-stronger-middle-class01\">has laid out his desires</a> to create more jobs and increase take-home pay.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeparately, we searched the Nexis database of news coverage and did not unearth other instances of Romney lofting the borrow-from-your-parents&#39; idea.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCastro told his fellow Democrats that Romney urged students at an Ohio university that if they have to, they should borrow money from their parents to start a business. Romney, in fact, said that.
