The Defense Department&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/NPR/\">web page</a> for the Nuclear Posture Review describes it as &quot;legislatively mandated.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://membership.politifact.com\"><strong>HELP KEEP POLITIFACT GOING!<br />\r\nMAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT<br />\r\nINDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKING</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, it&rsquo;s common for new presidents to put their stamp on the nation&rsquo;s nuclear capabilities by issuing a new review within two years after entering office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Clinton produced one in <a href=\"https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/doctrine/dod/95_npr.htm\">1994</a>. George W. Bush produced one in <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/us-nuclear-weapons-policy/nuclear-posture-review#.WYtG5oTyu70\">2002</a>. And Barack Obama produced one in <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/features/defenseReviews/NPR/2010_Nuclear_Posture_Review_Report.pdf\">2010</a>. (Apparently, the Trump administration hasn&rsquo;t updated its Pentagon web page on the Nuclear Posture Review. When we accessed it on Aug. 9, it <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3921807-NPR-Screenshot.html\">still had a photo and &quot;notable quote&quot; by Hillary Clinton on it</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A larger issue with Trump&rsquo;s assurance: Experts unanimously said the U.S. nuclear arsenal could not have improved to the extent Trump described in just over 200 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been incremental improvements, but they have been trickling out under a plan begun under Trump&rsquo;s predecessor, Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States is engaged in a multiyear program to modernize the nation&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal, including the rebuilding of the Minuteman III system, which launches intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Trident II submarine-launched missile systems, as well as the refurbishment of nuclear warheads and construction of new and upgraded facilities, such as a uranium processing facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. (Here&rsquo;s an <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/USNuclearModernization\">updated rundown</a> of the modernization plan published by the Arms Control Association.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modernization effort was estimated to cost roughly $35 billion a year over a decade, or 5 percent to 6 percent of planned national defense spending, according to Congressional Budget Office reports released in <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44968\">December 2013</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49870\">January 2015</a>. Its <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52401\">most recent estimate</a>, released in February 2017, CBO said the modernization effort would cost $400 billion between 2017 and 2026, or $52 billion more than CBO&rsquo;s 2015 estimate, &quot;largely because modernization programs will be ramping up.&quot; Cumulatively, total costs&nbsp;could reach $1 trillion over the next 30 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts panned Trump&#39;s boast&nbsp;of rapid improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would be a pretty fantastic claim under even Cold War standards given the size and scope of the arsenal,&quot; said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University&#39;s Center on Global Energy Policy and a former State Department official under Obama. But given the restrictions under the New START treaty that went into force in 2011, it would be &quot;pretty difficult, if not impossible, to achieve except in a crash, well-publicized effort.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matthew Bunn, a nuclear-policy specialist who teaches at Harvard University&#39;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, called Trump&rsquo;s claim &quot;simply false.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is a total of nothing that has changed substantially about the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the few months that Trump has been in office,&quot; Bunn said. &quot;We have the same missiles and bombers, with the same nuclear weapons, that we had before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: In the scale of decades, six months is a blink of the eye, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the first time Trump has sought to paint a picture of weak stewardship of the U.S. nuclear arsenal under Obama. As early as June 2015, Trump said, &quot;Even our nuclear arsenal doesn&#39;t work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don&#39;t know if it worked.&quot; We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-our-nuclear-arsenal-doesnt-work/\">False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;My first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal.

In addition, the ongoing nuclear modernization plan -- which dates back to the Obama administration and will take decades to complete -- would not have notched achievements in six months sufficient to be characterized as &quot;far stronger and more powerful than ever before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>EDITOR&#39;S NOTE, Aug. 9, 2017, 4:30 p.m.:</strong> This article has been updated to include CBO&#39;s 2017 cost estimate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2017-08-09T15:27:38.612487", "ruling_date": "2017-08-09T16:02:43", "ruling_headline": "Fact-checking Donald Trump's misleading tweet about U.S. nuclear arsenal", "ruling_headline_slug": "under-donald-trump-us-nuclear-arsenal-far-stronger", "ruling_link_text": "Modernization will take decades", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/895252459152711680\">tweet</a>, Aug. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/presidential-memorandum-rebuilding-us-armed-forces\">presidential memorandum on rebuilding the U.S. Armed Forces</a>, Jan. 27, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense Department, <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/NPR/\">Nuclear Posture Review home page</a>, accessed Aug. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nuclear Posture Review, <a href=\"https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/doctrine/dod/95_npr.htm\">1994</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/us-nuclear-weapons-policy/nuclear-posture-review#.WYtG5oTyu70\">2002</a> and <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/features/defenseReviews/NPR/2010_Nuclear_Posture_Review_Report.pdf\">2010</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44968\">Projected Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces, 2014 to 2023</a>,&quot; Dec. 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49870\">Projected Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces, 2015 to 2024</a>,&quot; Jan. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arms Control Association, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/USNuclearModernization\">U.S. Nuclear Modernization Programs</a>&quot; (fact sheet), accessed Aug. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-our-nuclear-arsenal-doesnt-work/\">Trump Threatens &lsquo;Fire and Fury&rsquo; Against North Korea if It Endangers U.S.</a>,&quot; Aug. 8, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/politics/trump-nuclear-posture-review/index.html\">Pentagon begins review of nuclear weapons policy</a>,&quot; April 17, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-our-nuclear-arsenal-doesnt-work/\">Donald Trump says &#39;our nuclear arsenal doesn&#39;t work</a>,&#39; &quot; June 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, Aug. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Richard Nephew, senior research scholar at Columbia University&#39;s Center on Global Energy Policy, Aug. 9, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Matthew Bunn, nuclear-policy specialist who teaches at Harvard University&#39;s John F.
