Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas &mdash; a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee &mdash; argued that a vote for the tax bill amounts to a vote to give the president a massive windfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The result in the House (of passing the tax bill) was just a matter of arithmetic and was never much in doubt,&quot; Doggett said. &quot;I am pleased that all Democrats and 13 Republicans voted against what I consider to be a real job-killing bill. I&#39;m not surprised President Trump would come (to Capitol Hill to support the bill) because he and his family would walk off with more than a billion dollars personally.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He repeated a similar version of the claim on the <em><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-really-benefits-from-gops-tax-overhaul-is-battle-point-as-house-passes-its-bill\">PBS NewsHour</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research suggests that Trump and his family (as well as other wealthy Americans) do stand to benefit&nbsp;from the bill. However, this billion-dollar talking point needs important context that Doggett didn&rsquo;t provide, including key differences between the House and Senate bills. (Doggett&#39;s office did not reply to an inquiry for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, we don&rsquo;t know much about Trump&#39;s tax situation due to his own actions. The estimates we have depend on a leaked tax return from 12 years ago, and a lot may&nbsp;have changed since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Trump would save big from estate tax repeal</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of the savings for Trump come from fully repealing the estate tax, which is part of the House-passed bill but not the Senate&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. Due to generous exemptions, the tax generally hits wealthy taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from the tax, according to the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-estate-gift-and-generation-skipping-transfer-taxes-work\">Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center</a>. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. However, family-owned farms and closely-held businesses may be able to pay less or pay in low-interest installments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyses by the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> and NBC attempted to understand how Trump&#39;s finances would be impacted by the House bill, relying on a partial tax return from 2005. There&#39;s no way of knowing whether 2005 was an unusual year for Trump&rsquo;s finances, which would skew the results of a forward-looking analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/28/us/politics/trump-tax-benefit.html\">analysis</a>&nbsp;found that Trump&rsquo;s taxes could be cut by more than $1.1 billion. The elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the lowering of the pass-through tax rate for certain types of business income -- minus tax increases from eliminating many existing deductions -- would leave Trump $42 million better off. (The alternative minimum tax requires that taxpayers with many deductions pay at least a minimum amount of taxes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the biggest benefit would come from changes to the estate tax &mdash; $1.1 billion more for Trump &mdash; under a full elimination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NBC <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-his-family-could-save-more-1-billion-under-house-n821491\">analysis</a> <a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/TODAY/z_Creative/inline-headers/Trump%20and%20HR-1%20Version%202.pdf\">undertaken</a> by <a href=\"http://www.marcumllp.com/people/Maury-Cartine\">Maury Cartine</a>, the partner in charge of tax and business services in the New York City office of the Marcum Group, found net savings of $22.5 million for Trump, primarily from eliminating the alternative minimum tax, plus $1.1 billion from shelving the estate tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the vast majority of the &quot;more than a billion dollars&quot; Doggett referred to stems from the estate tax. But Doggett left out a few important pieces of context about that figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Trump&rsquo;s finances are shrouded in secrecy. </strong>It&rsquo;s important to emphasize that any estimates of Trump&rsquo;s potential savings are subject to a lot of uncertainty due to a lack of hard data on his finances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump refused to follow the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/world/asia/japan-tokyo-smoking.html?emc=edit_tnt_20171127&amp;nlid=57271995&amp;tntemail0=y&amp;_r=0\">decades-old presidential precedent</a> of releasing his tax returns (and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1421/release-his-tax-returns-after-audit-completed/\">broke his promise</a> to release them).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s current income and wealth picture is unclear, and would change by the time of his eventual death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>The final tax plan may not include a full estate tax repeal. </strong>While the House bill would end the estate tax after 2024, the Senate bill <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-senate-gop-tax-proposal\">would keep it</a>, instead doubling the current exemption for individuals to $11 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would drastically lower Trump&rsquo;s estimated savings to the tens of millions, rather than $1.1 billion, according to the analyses we just described.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the <em>New York Times</em> and NBC analyses assumed that the estate tax would be totally eliminated when they made their calculation that Trump would save $1.1 billion. Neither analysis looked at the alternative Senate approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doggett, a House member, was apparently referring to the House bill. However, the reality is that the fate of the estate tax -- and the subsequent effect on Trump&rsquo;s taxes -- remains up in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;<strong> Trump wouldn&rsquo;t simply &quot;walk away&quot; with that much money. </strong>Trump might save tens of millions of dollars in short order, according to the two media-sponsored analyses, but any potential savings from the estate tax would come only after a death, presumably years down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To get it as high as $1 billion, one needs estate tax repeal, and it is certainly right to note that this would be deferred,&quot; said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. &quot;Indeed, under present law the estate tax wouldn&rsquo;t be levied until Trump&rsquo;s wife died, rather than just him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melania Trump is 47, 24 years younger than Trump. She could outlive him by decades, delaying any estate tax benefit to the family&rsquo;s heirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Doggett said that under the Republican tax bill, Trump &quot;and his family would walk off with more than a billion dollars personally.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Independent analyses, working from bare-bones public information about Trump&rsquo;s income picture, suggest that he stands to benefit in the short term by somewhere in the low tens of millions of dollars. Getting that figure up to $1 billion requires factoring in the estate tax -- but that demands some caveats that Doggett didn&rsquo;t mention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no certainty that the House version of the bill, which eliminates the estate tax entirely, will ultimately prevail. And the family couldn&rsquo;t simply &quot;walk off&quot; with $1 billion in benefits; to achieve that windfall might require waiting until Melania Trump&rsquo;s death several decades from now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tens of millions of dollars in tax savings would be real money to most Americans, but it&rsquo;s far less than the catchy $1 billion figure Doggett has repeatedly highlighted.
