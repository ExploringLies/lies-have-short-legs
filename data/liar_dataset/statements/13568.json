He cut short the trip by one day to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/12/remarks-president-memorial-service-fallen-dallas-police-officers\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>speak</u></a> at a memorial service in Dallas for the slain policemen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Baton Rouge</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three Baton Rouge law enforcement officers were ambushed and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/baton-rouge-police-ambush/baton-rouge-police-ambush-cop-killer-didn-t-make-911-n611366\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>shot to death</u></a> on July, 17, 2016.

Two brave men won&#39;t be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day - and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal - prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Pratt if he had second thoughts about his comment about Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nah,&quot; he replied, saying the president&rsquo;s statements deploring the attacks on police have been tempered by other comments Obama has made legitimizing the distrust many blacks have of police officers. For example, Obama <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/07/07/president-obama-fatal-shootings-alton-sterling-and-philando-castile\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> on July 7, 2016, that while most police perform admirably, there are racial &quot;biases, some conscious and unconscious, that have to be rooted out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pratt told us that Obama &quot;has stirred the pot,&quot; on attacking police. &quot;He&rsquo;s looking for division.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should finally note that Pratt is not the first to accuse Obama of being aloof about the attacks on police. Our colleagues at PunditFact on July 8, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/12/william-johnson/law-enforcement-lobbyist-says-pro-police-speech-ma/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>examined</u></a> a similar comment by William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Officers. They rated it Pants on Fire. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pratt said Obama never &quot;condemned&quot; murders targeting police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His outrageous statement ignores the president&rsquo;s expressions of abhorrence following each of three different ambush murders of multiple police officers in the last two years. &nbsp;Obama publicly called the killings &quot;vicious,&quot; &quot;reprehensible,&quot; &quot;cowardly,&quot; and &quot;despicable.&quot; &nbsp;Following the 2014 slaying of two New York policemen, Obama used the very word Pratt denies him, saying, &quot;I unconditionally condemn&quot;
