Steve Oroho (R-Dist. 24). He cited that statistic in a May 26 Star-Ledger news story about how the Legislature will fit a Supreme Court-ordered $500 million payment to New Jersey&rsquo;s 31 Abbott districts in the state budget. Lawmakers have to reach an agreement before July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, on how to spend approximately $30 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOroho said in that story that he won&rsquo;t vote for a budget that sends the $500 million just to the Abbott districts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have the highest per-pupil cost in the country,&quot; he said. &quot;No one can say there&rsquo;s not enough money in education.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether Oroho was right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senator, a certified financial planner who serves on the Senate&rsquo;s Budget and Appropriations and Economic Growth committees, told us he researched National Center for Education Statistics data going back to the 2004-05 academic year. He said his statement was based on data for 2006-07, which showed that New Jersey&rsquo;s per-pupil cost -- for grades K-12 and including all school districts -- was $17,794.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey contacted the nonpartisan National Center for Education Statistics to vet Oroho&rsquo;s statistic. We studied nearly 10 years&rsquo; worth of data and found that among states, New Jersey has had the highest per-pupil cost in the nation since at least the 1999-00 school year. It&rsquo;s worth noting that Washington, DC -- not a state -- had higher per-pupil costs than New Jersey from 1999-03 and from 2006-07.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCathy Clement, operations officer for the National Center for Education Statistics, explained that the center&rsquo;s data comes from information reported by local jurisdictions to states, which then report the data to the U.S. Department of Education. The national center is part of the Education Department&rsquo;s Institute of Education Sciences.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe New Jersey Education Association, however, disputes Oroho&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpokesman Steve Baker shared with PolitiFact New Jersey the Public Education Finances: 2009 report issued May 20 by the U.S. Census Bureau. It shows that New Jersey was third in per-pupil spending for the 2008-09 year, at $16,271. New York was highest, at $18,126, followed by Washington, DC, $16,408.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Center for Education Statistics told us the discrepancy stems from slight differences in what costs get reported and factors such as whether public charter schools are included.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also checked with the New Jersey Department of Education to see which agency&rsquo;s figures they would rely on for accurate per-pupil cost data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We often cite National Center for Education Statistics,&quot; said Alan Guenther, department spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo why is education so expensive in New Jersey?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBoth Oroho and Baker say there are multiple factors involved. Oroho points to administrative costs and regulatory requirements as possible factors. The NJEA&rsquo;s Baker, referring to the School Finance 101 blog by Bruce Baker, no relation, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, cited special-needs programming and interventions, as well as education needs for children in poverty, as elements that contribute to per-pupil costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s return to Oroho&rsquo;s statement. The senator says New Jersey has the highest per-pupil costs in the country, but admits basing that statement on data for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 school years. Still, our analysis of data from a nonpartisan arm of the U.S. Department of Education shows that among states only, New Jersey has held the title of highest per-pupil costs in the nation for nearly a decade. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, ranks New Jersey&rsquo;s per-pupil spending for 2008-09 as third-highest in the nation. Therefore, we rate Oroho&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, join the conversation at <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/politifact_new_jersey_njs_per-.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-08T12:18:40.933873", "ruling_date": "2011-06-13T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
