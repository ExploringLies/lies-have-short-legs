DHS does not have any credible intelligence that terrorist organizations are planning to attempt to cross the southwest border to carry out attacks in the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also emailed the Texas Department of Public Safety, which <a href=\"https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/PublicInformation/operDrawbrdg.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>patrols the border</u></a>, to ask for any reports of ISIS activity thereabouts.DPS spokesman<strong> </strong>Tom Vinger emailed: &quot;The department does not have any information to provide.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, groups or individuals bandying similar claims <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/oct/10/duncan-hunter-2/duncan-hunter-makes-unconfirmed-claim-border-patro/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>alleged that law enforcement agencies suppress news</u></a> of ISIS at the border to avoid public panics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That in mind, we also queried experts outside of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, we asked <a href=\"http://commandcg.com/pdf/2015_Manjarrez,_Victor_Bio.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Victor M. Manjarrez</u></a>, director of the National Center for Border Security &amp; Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, if ISIS was operating at the border. Manjarrez, a former Border Patrol sector chief, said, &quot;no,&quot; adding that every report of ISIS at the border has been debunked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought perhaps there are reports Manjarrez hadn&rsquo;t seen, so we looked elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Center for Strategic and International Studies</u></a>, a Washington D.C.-based think tank which focuses partly on border security and international terrorism, we were referred to <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/rick-ozzie-nelson\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rick Nelson</u></a>, former director of the center&rsquo;s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program, who said in a phone interview he knew of no reports of ISIS at the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nelson said: &quot;There&rsquo;s no doubt that if ISIS had the opportunity, they would conduct an attack in the U.S., but to state that they&rsquo;re going to do so by going through Mexico and going through the southern border is a little bit disconnected.&quot; He said the group was more focused on radicalizing Americans already in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also emailed the <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>RAND Corporation</u></a>, a California-based think tank focused partly on national security, to ask about reports of ISIS at the border. By phone, <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/about/people/c/clarke_colin_p.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Colin Clarke</u></a>, a political scientist and national security research at RAND, said: &quot;I haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence that there are ISIS people coming across the border. My standard response is I haven&rsquo;t seen the evidence, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that at some point they won&rsquo;t try that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke said ISIS would need a domestic network of safe houses and weapons stashes to wage a significant attack, even if members were to come across the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, no confirmed ISIS sightings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked next at if the border has become &quot;porous&quot; on Obama&rsquo;s watch, as Abbott said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Border Patrol spending up, apprehensions down</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no signs of a more porous border that we divined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Nelson at the CSIS to what extent border security had decreased under Obama, he said, &quot;I would say it hasn&rsquo;t.&quot; He said, &quot;The amount of resources Obama has put forward to secure the border has been significant.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Obama&rsquo;s watch, federal figures suggest, border security spending and staffing escalated and, in the latest full fiscal year, 2015, apprehensions of individuals crossing the border without legal authority declined in comparison to the three previous years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some perspective:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>--</strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgfjc1i0YMwx8fHStWfRjXEpjE1Wlz8QvRH64BF8QmQ/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The congressionally approved $3.8 billion fiscal 2015 budget </u></a>for the Border Patrol, the on-the-ground border enforcement unit of Customs and Border Protection,was up an <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>inflation-adjusted</u></a> 29 percent from fiscal 2009, the year Obama succeeded George W.

DACA blocked deportation for qualified unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children and DAPA did the same for parents of qualified citizens and permanent residents. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lawsuit<strong> </strong>predicted that both moves<strong> </strong>would &quot;substantially increase the number of undocumented immigrants in the plaintiff states&quot; because &quot;the removal of the deportation threat, combined with the incentives to stay, will make remaining in the United States far more attractive.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Manjarrez if DACA and DAPA made the border more porous. &quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t say porous, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s increased the clutter,&quot; he said. &quot;Some people translate that to more porous, I say the border is now at a higher risk to be exploited by some interest.&quot; For instance, he said that many children who arrived amid a surge in 2014-2015 cited rumors that they would not be deported as a motivation for their trips to the border. The increased &quot;clutter&quot; at the border, he said, made it harder for Border Patrol agents to pinpoint security threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve looked before into <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jun/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-accurately-recaps-survey-result-indicatin/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>claims</u></a> that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jul/07/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrectly-says-barack-obama-has-promise/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Obama policies fueled the migrant surge</u></a>. At the time,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>experts and news reports gave more credit to rising violence in Central American countries and to a 2008 law passed under Bush shielding non-Mexican children from immediate deportation when apprehended at the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Abbott again</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shared our findings--no confirmation of ISIS on the border and statistics suggesting a greater security presence--with the governor&rsquo;s office. Wittman said Abbott had nothing to add.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott said &quot;ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama&rsquo;s policies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no factual basis &mdash; Abbott offered none &mdash; to support the claim that ISIS is &quot;running through&quot; the border. Other claims of ISIS forces marshaling on the U.S.-Mexico border have been debunked, and this one deserves the same fate. Border security itself has been stepped up, by the federal government and Texas, with apprehensions lately on the decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott&rsquo;s claim isn&rsquo;t just wrong, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.
