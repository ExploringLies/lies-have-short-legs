Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Allen West has been good for political theater but bad for fact-checkers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you missed it, Wasserman Schultz -- a Democrat -- criticized West -- a Republican -- this week over his support for a plan to sharply reduce federal spending and require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In a speech Tuesday on the floor of the U.S. House, Wasserman Schultz said the West-backed GOP plan would raise costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and that it was &quot;unbelievable&quot; for West to support it because he represents so many South Florida seniors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWest responded via e-mail. &quot;Look Debbie ... you want a personal fight, I am happy to oblige. You are the most vile, unprofessional, and despicable member of the U.S. House of Representatives. If you have something to say to me, stop being a coward and say it to my face, otherwise, shut the heck up.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSee? Not a lot to check in either statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut as the debate ballooned into cable news drama Wednesday and Thursday, Wasserman Schultz provided an interview -- and a sound bite -- to CNN&#39;s Wolf Blitzer that had us scratching our heads.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWasserman Schultz said she is West&#39;s elected representative to the House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He&#39;s a constituent of mine, and so I was dutifully doing my job and representing my constituents and taking to task someone who I think is really taking the wrong position when it comes to the people we represent in South Florida who badly need that safety net and make sure that we&#39;re not going to dramatically increase their costs, which that cut, cap and balance plan does,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlitzer stopped for a moment. &quot;So you&#39;re saying he lives in your district, he doesn&#39;t live in his own district?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yes,&quot; Wasserman Schultz continued, &quot;Congressman West is a constituent of the 20th Congressional District, but represents the 22nd.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo win a seat on the city council, you have to live in that city when you take office. To win a seat in the state House, or the state Senate, you also have to live in the district you represent. The obvious question is why would it work differently for Congress?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Constitution, that&#39;s why. The requirements for U.S. House members are spelled out in Article I, Section 2: &quot;No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;re not sure why the framers loved all the negatives, but in other words: U.S. House members need only live in the state they represent to be eligible for their seat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Remember back in 1789, things weren&#39;t like they are today,&quot; said lawyer Mark Herron, an elections expert based in Tallahassee. &quot;A state was a state. It was just a reflection of the times, and they tried to keep it as simple as possible.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, the <em><a href=\"http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2010/11/10/how-many-congressmen-and-congressmen-elect-live-outside-their-districts/\">Roanoke Times</a></em> recently identified a handful of House members who lived outside their districts, including Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, California Democrat John Garamendi and Georgia Democrat David Scott.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd West does, too, it turns out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWest moved to Florida with his wife, Angela, and two daughters in 2004 after retiring from the Army. The former colonel lives in a four-bedroom, two-bathroom $200,000 home in the city of Plantation, Broward County property records show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis zip code, when punched into the U.S. House of Representatives website, and his address, when entered into the <em>St. Petersburg Times</em>&#39; <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/mylawmaker/\">MyLawmaker database</a>, both show his home falling in Florida&#39;s 20th Congressional District, represented by Wasserman Schultz.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWest has owned up to this before. Amid questions over residency requirements for several South Florida lawmakers in 2008, West correctly cited federal law to the <em><a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/autos/content/local_news/epaper/2008/09/29/a1a_residences_09291.html\">Palm Beach Post</a></em> and explained, &quot;I&#39;m a distance runner, and I even do my 5 to 10 miles mostly in District 22.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The U.S. Constitution says only that a person must live in the state in which he is running for Congress,&quot; said West, then a challenger to former Rep. Ron Klein. &quot;But I&#39;m not trying to hide where I live. Yes, I live just outside the district. Part of Plantation is in District 22 and the other part in District 20. The dividing line is University Drive and I live about a mile from there.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They redistrict every 10 years anyway and what are you supposed to do, move all the time?&quot; West said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&#39;t answer that. But on the matter at hand, Wasserman Schultz is correct that she can count West as a constituent. And it&#39;s okay, according to the U.S. Constitution.
