Supporters say the law ensures quality work and fair pay for workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Assembly Labor Committee <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gop-lawmakers-push-prevailing-wage-repeal-in-hearing-b99508143z1-305179461.html\">voted 5-4 on May 27, 2015 </a>&nbsp;to advance a measure that would repeal the law. Through a spokeswoman, Gov. Scott Walker said he would sign a bill repealing or amending the law. But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos says he has no plans to schedule a vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a group calling itself Protect American jobs has launched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjl6Db50pmE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">television ad</a> that warns of unintended consequences if the prevailing wage law is changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wisconsin worksites could soon be taken over with illegal workers,&quot; the announcer intones. &quot;Politicians in Madison are about to weaken the law to make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad goes on to urges viewers to contact Walker and tell him &quot;no to the illegal worker loophole in the state budget.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait. Illegal workers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the ad started running, no one was talking about that issue. Would the prevailing wage measure &quot;make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Illegal workers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the most basic problem: The ad says the measure is in the state budget. But the move to repeal prevailing wage has been introduced as a separate piece of legislation, not as part of the 2015-&rsquo;17 spending plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the substance of the claim, we tried to reach the group, but did not get a response, so we turned to the ad itself and the group&rsquo;s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ad, a caption on the screen cites <a href=\"http://www.masoncontractors.org/pdf/immigration-20130313.pdf\">&quot;ABC/ACG policy letter: 3/13/2013&quot;</a> during one mention of illegal workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That appears to be <a href=\"http://www.masoncontractors.org/pdf/immigration-20130313.pdf\">a letter</a> urging immigration law reform that was sent to members of Congress by a group that called itself a &quot;broad base of contractors&quot; that employ &quot;thousands in all facets of construction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter says that &quot;any future immigration law must include a new market driven program to provide a legal path for foreign workers to enter the United States when the economy needs them, with fewer entering when the U.S. economy contracts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, but that refers to <em>legal</em> immigration. And the letter came years before this prevailing wage measure was introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://protectamericanjobsnow.com/\">Protect American Jobs web site</a> goes further, suggesting the &quot;real motivation&quot; for the prevailing wage repeal can be found in a different letter from an executive with the Associated Building Contractors, a non-union group. That letter cited the need to &quot;make it easier for people to move to the United States from other countries and work in the construction industry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, that refers to legal immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group also refers to an &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wisconsincontractorcoalition.com/application/files/9914/2889/7832/Wisconsin_Report_April_2015.pdf\">April 2015 paper by University of Utah economist Peter Philips</a> -- written at the request of the Wisconsin Contractors Coalition -- that notes the end of prevailing wage laws would lead to lower pay and less apprentice training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper goes on to say that other states where such laws have been repealed have seen a call for guest workers, because when wages fell contractors had trouble attracting workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a guest worker program does not amount to illegal workers. By its very definition, guest workers are in the United States legally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, the television ad doesn&rsquo;t say there could be such problems down the road. It says the proposed bill, as written, contains an &quot;illegal worker loophole.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that, we turned to the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which issued a <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/assembly/sanfelippo/pressreleases/Documents/Memo%20on%20Prevailing%20Wage%20Repeal%20and%20Undocumented%20Workers.pdf\">May 26, 2015 memo </a>that said flatly the proposed bill doesn&rsquo;t address immigration. The council assists members of both parties with the drafting of legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While the bill removes the requirement for employers to maintain certain records concerning wages paid to workers on a project of public works, that requirement relates only to enforcement of the prevailing wage law by the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT),&quot; the memo reads. &quot;The repeal of that record -keeping requirement does not affect enforcement of federal immigration laws by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A television ad from a group against repeal of the state&rsquo;s prevailing wage law says such a measure would &quot;make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs.&quot; This &quot;illegal worker loophole,&quot; it says, is in the state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the bill doesn&rsquo;t have any direct impact on immigration laws and the group&rsquo;s own references to potential problems -- down the road -- describe workers who would be here legally, not illegally. It also fails on the basic claim of the stand-alone measure being in the state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-02T17:51:40.481490", "ruling_date": "2015-06-05T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Group claims repeal of prevailing wage would open an 'illegal worker loophole'", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-claims-repeal-prevailing-wage-would-open-ill", "ruling_link_text": "No loophole for illegal workers to slip through", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjl6Db50pmE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Protect American Jobs television ad, May 5, 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protect American Jobs <a href=\"https://protectamericanjobsnow.com/\">website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.masoncontractors.org/pdf/immigration-20130313.pdf\">Contractors&rsquo; letter to members of Congress, March 13, 2013</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wisconsincontractorcoalition.com/application/files/9914/2889/7832/Wisconsin_Report_April_2015.pdf\">&quot;Wisconsin&rsquo;s prevailing wage law,&quot; </a>Peter Philips, University of Utah, April 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/assembly/sanfelippo/pressreleases/Documents/Memo%20on%20Prevailing%20Wage%20Repeal%20and%20Undocumented%20Workers.pdf\">Wisconsin Legislative Council memo</a>, May 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gop-lawmakers-push-prevailing-wage-repeal-in-hearing-b99508143z1-305179461.html\">&quot;GOP lawmakers advance prevailing wage repeal,&quot;</a> May 27, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3203, "last_name": "Protect American Jobs", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "protect-american-jobs", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup___________________43.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3203/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>A measure to repeal the state&rsquo;s prevailing wage law would &quot;make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs&quot; through an &quot;illegal worker loophole in the state budget.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television ad", "statement_date": "2015-05-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 192, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/192/", "subject": "Labor", "subject_slug": "labor", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
