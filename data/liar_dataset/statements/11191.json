When asked about Trump&rsquo;s top position in the polls, Fiorina explained that Trump has connected with a legitimate frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would (be)&nbsp;resolved, the political class has failed you,&quot; Fiorina said. &quot;That&#39;s just a fact, and that&#39;s what Donald Trump taps into. I would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this fact-check, we assess whether Trump has changed his mind on abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina&rsquo;s staff apparently was so sure this would come up, a day after the debate, they <a href=\"https://carlyforamerica.com/blog/the-truth-about-donald-trump/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>posted a page on their campaign website</u></a> with supporting information. They cited articles from the <em>Washington Post </em>and <em>National Journal </em>that documented Trump&rsquo;s shift from saying he was pro-choice to now saying he is pro-life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;I am very pro-choice&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s flirtations with a presidential bid have put him on record at various moments in a couple of election cycles. In 1999, he appeared on NBC&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-in-1999-i-am-very-pro-choice-480297539914\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Meet the Press</u></a></em>, when he was thinking about a third-party run.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am very pro-choice,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I hear people debating the subject.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When pressed on whether he would ban a procedure called &quot;partial-birth&quot; by abortion foes, Trump said, &quot;No. I would not. I am pro-choice in every respect as far as it goes, but I just hate it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his 2000 book <em><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PV6qZU_xev8C&amp;lpg=PT262&amp;vq=single-payer&amp;pg=PT32#v=snippet&amp;q=abortion&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The America We Deserve</u></a></em>, Trump affirmed his basic position, but reversed his stand on that one particular procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;There are some issues I don&rsquo;t want to say much about. I support a woman&rsquo;s right to choose, for example, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures. When Tim Russert asked me on <em>Meet the Press</em> if I would ban partial-birth abortion if I were president, my pro-choice instincts led me to say no. After the show, I consulted two doctors I respect and, upon learning more about this procedure, I have concluded that I would indeed support a ban.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as of 2000, Trump has &quot;pro-choice instincts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;I&#39;m pro-life&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In mid February 2011, with Trump again fueling speculation that he would run for president, he spoke at the annual meeting of the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PlT9fAkj0XU\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Conservative Political Action Committee</u></a>. In his 14-minute speech, he made this simple declaration: &quot;I am pro-life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months later in April, he sat down with the <a href=\"http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2011/04/08/brody-file-exclusive-donald-trump-explains-pro-life-conversion.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Christian Broadcasting Network</u></a>&rsquo;s political correspondent, who asked if he would really stand by his new belief. Here is what Trump said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;One thing about me, I&rsquo;m a very honorable guy. I&rsquo;m pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">One of the reasons I changed &mdash; one of the primary reasons &mdash; a friend of mine, his wife was pregnant, in this case married. She was pregnant, and ... he didn&rsquo;t really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He&rsquo;s crying as he&rsquo;s telling me. They ended up for some reason, amazingly, through luck because they didn&rsquo;t have the right timing, he ends up having the baby, and the baby is the apple of his eye. He said, it&rsquo;s the greatest thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">And you know, here&rsquo;s a baby that wasn&rsquo;t going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, by 2011, Trump opposed abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These days, he often re-tells the story about his friend&rsquo;s unplanned child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A curious interruption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump clarified his stance on abortion in a January interview with Mark Halperin of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MzGrSYWAkxg\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bloomberg News</u></a>. Trump said the only exceptions to banning abortions would be to protect the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we noted this twist in that brief discussion:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Trump: </strong>&quot;With caveats, life of the mother, incest and rape. And that&rsquo;s where I stand. So I&rsquo;m pro-life, but with the caveats.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s life of the mother,very important, incest and rape.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Halperin: </strong>&quot;So say a woman is pregnant and it&rsquo;s not in any of those exception categories and she chooses to have an abortion, should she --&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Trump: </strong>&quot;It depends when, it depends when. It depends when.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Halperin: </strong>&quot;Well let&rsquo;s say early in her pregnancy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Trump: </strong>&quot;Excuse me. If it&rsquo;s not in any of those -- pro-life. &nbsp;Mark it&rsquo;s very simple. Pro-life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump interrupted Halperin to say &quot;it depends when.&quot; We reached out to Trump&rsquo;s campaign and asked what he meant. We did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina said that Trump changed his mind on abortion, and by Trump&rsquo;s own admission, that is accurate. As late as 2000, he wrote that he was pro-choice. By 2011, he said he was pro-life. Recently, he noted that he thinks exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape are appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We find some murkiness in his repetition of &quot;It depends when,&quot; but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fundamental finding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-11T15:38:02.094088", "ruling_date": "2015-08-11T15:31:01", "ruling_headline": "Fiorina: Trump's abortion flip-flop", "ruling_headline_slug": "fiorina-trumps-abortion-flip-flop", "ruling_link_text": "A full flip, with an odd twist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Fox News, <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4406890723001/watch-a-replay-of-fox-news-5-pm-presidential-debate/?#sp=show-clips\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>First Republican Presidential Debate</u></a>, Aug. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carly for America, <a href=\"https://carlyforamerica.com/blog/the-truth-about-donald-trump/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The truth about Donald Trump</u></a>, Aug. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-in-1999-i-am-very-pro-choice-480297539914\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump in 1999: &#39;I am Very Pro-Choice&#39;</u></a>, Oct. 24, 1999</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PV6qZU_xev8C&amp;lpg=PT262&amp;vq=single-payer&amp;pg=PT32#v=snippet&amp;q=abortion&amp;f=false\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The America We Deserve</u></a>, 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian Broadcasting Network, <a href=\"http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2011/04/08/brody-file-exclusive-donald-trump-explains-pro-life-conversion.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump Explains Pro-Life Conversion</u></a>, April 8, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reality Report TV, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PlT9fAkj0XU\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump at CPAC</u></a>, Feb. 14, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MzGrSYWAkxg\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump on Abortion: I&rsquo;m Pro-Life</u></a>, Jan. 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Leslie Shedd, spokesperson, Carly for America, Aug. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Carly", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "California", "id": 428, "last_name": "Fiorina", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "carly-fiorina", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Fiorina_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/428/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://carlyforca.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Donald Trump has &quot;changed his mind&quot; on abortion.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the first Republican presidential debate", "statement_date": "2015-08-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 11, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/11/", "subject": "Abortion", "subject_slug": "abortion", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
