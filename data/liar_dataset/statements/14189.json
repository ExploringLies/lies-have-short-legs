Wagner opened by asking about one of the governor&rsquo;s favorite topics: property tax reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker responded by declaring that property taxes on a median-value home &quot;are lower right now than they were&quot; in December 2010, the month before he took office. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s correct, though there&rsquo;s a caveat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prior fact checks</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no question property taxes, though they might increase for some individual property owners and decrease for others, have generally been on the decline since Walker took office and his fellow Republicans took control of the Legislature in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/15/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-property-taxes-are-low/\">we rated Mostly True</a> a Walker claim that because of his actions, property taxes were lower than they were four years earlier. Walker&rsquo;s actions to limit the ability of local governments and school districts to raise levies played a major role. But the lower property taxes to that point were also due in part to declines in housing values. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2017, when Walker said that property taxes -- as a percentage of personal income -- were &quot;the lowest that they&#39;ve been since the end of World War II,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-property-taxes-percent/\">our rating was True</a>. An analysis by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance showed that on the measure Walker cited, they were lowest since 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And on our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/\">Walk-O-Meter</a>, which tracks Walker&rsquo;s campaign promises, we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/1186/cut-property-taxes-so-levy-typical-home-2018-lower/\">rated In the Works</a> his pledge to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Current claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s new claim refers to a specific measure -- an estimate of the hypothetical property tax on a median-valued, or typical, Wisconsin home.
