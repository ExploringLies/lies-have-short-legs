Recently, he&rsquo;s begun targeting Tom Wolf, the Democrat who has become the frontrunner in a four-way Democratic primary. Since March, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/governor/pennsylvania_governor_race.html\"><u>Wolf has led Corbett</u></a> in general-election polls by between seven and 19 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://tomcorbettforgovernor.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=78b3cb3ef7edb0ad4f8d03c13&amp;id=a191b704d7&amp;e=7bf22e7603\"><u>radio ad</u></a> released April 30, 2014, Corbett&rsquo;s campaign took aim at Wolf&rsquo;s record when he was serving as Pennsylvania&rsquo;s revenue secretary, an appointed position that handles tax collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wolf was appointed to the position by then-Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, and confirmed by the state Senate, which was in Republican hands. He served as revenue secretary from April 2007 until November 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what Corbett&rsquo;s ad said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wolf &quot;conveniently left out of his ads that he was the state&rsquo;s revenue secretary in Harrisburg. You know, the top tax collector. And Wolf was a job-killing bureaucrat. On Wolf&rsquo;s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs, and our unemployment went up almost 50 percent. But the real insult? Wolf is a millionaire, but he fought to increase taxes on average Pennsylvanians, including higher taxes on home heating and the sales tax. Tom Wolf: high taxes, fewer jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of claims for a brief ad, but for this fact-check we&rsquo;re going to focus on the claim that &quot;on Wolf&rsquo;s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs.&quot; For claims like this one, we take into account two factors -- whether the statistics cited are accurate, and whether it&rsquo;s reasonable to assign credit or blame to the target of the ad. So we&rsquo;ll take this claim point by point. With this ad, the statistics quoted are reasonable, but the blame is off-base -- especially the cause of Pennsylvania&#39;s job loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To the extent that taxes were high, was Wolf responsible?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We won&rsquo;t address whether taxes were too high in Pennsylvania, since that&rsquo;s an opinion on which reasonable people can disagree. But we <em>can </em>judge whether Wolf bears responsibility for the state of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s taxes while he was serving as revenue secretary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, here&rsquo;s Corbett&rsquo;s argument. A Corbett spokesman, Billy Pitman, noted that the Tax Foundation found Pennsylvania to have the 10th highest tax burden among states in 2007 and 2008. (The Tax Foundation is a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pitman said the ad was referring to some specific taxes Wolf advocated for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In his position as the commonwealth&rsquo;s top tax collector, Secretary Wolf lobbied the legislature on behalf of the Rendell administration he served,&quot; Pitman said. Among the proposals Pitman specifically cited were an increase to the sales tax, an oil-company tax and hikes to electricity and garbage-collection taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Corbett campaign has a point that Wolf, as a member of Rendell&rsquo;s cabinet, advocated for some tax hikes (though also for some reductions); we found <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/02/21/Rendell-appointee-defends-sales-tax-hike/stories/200702210218\">news</a> <a href=\"http://www.dteam2014.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20070504_YorkDispatch_WolfTalksAboutTaxesInYorkToutsRendellsProposals.pdf\">reports</a> to back that up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the ad exaggerates Wolf&rsquo;s influence on the shape of tax policy in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s tax landscape was set well before Wolf got on the job. In <a href=\"http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/document/758207/2007_04_mrr_pdf\"><u>April 2007</u></a>, corporate taxes accounted for about one-fifth of tax revenues, sales taxes accounted for about one-quarter, and personal income taxes accounted for about 55 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that adding a percentage point to the state sales tax, as Wolf advocated, would have represented a modest increase to a levy that represented just one-quarter of the state&rsquo;s overall tax revenue. The other taxes he advocated for would have had an even more modest impact on the state&rsquo;s overall tax architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why does this matter? Because the ad said that &quot;on Wolf&rsquo;s watch, taxes were high.&quot; This suggests that Wolf is to blame for the state&rsquo;s overall tax structure, rather than just for proposing marginal expansions. In reality, most of the state&rsquo;s tax structure was already well-established before Wolf was even sworn in, so it&rsquo;s a stretch to lay the blame for &quot;high taxes&quot; at his feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the ad overhypes how much impact Wolf had on tax policy as revenue secretary. While Wolf certainly engaged in at least some advocacy, as the <a href=\"http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/02/21/Rendell-appointee-defends-sales-tax-hike/stories/200702210218\">newspaper</a> <a href=\"http://www.dteam2014.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20070504_YorkDispatch_WolfTalksAboutTaxesInYorkToutsRendellsProposals.pdf\">articles</a> noted, his job duties were exclusively administrative, not policy-setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/about_us/13466/overview_of_the_pa_department_of_revenue/580829\"><u>secretary&rsquo;s job</u></a>, according to the department&rsquo;s website, is to &quot;administer the tax laws of the commonwealth in a fair and equitable manner.&quot; Raising taxes or creating new ones is up to the governor and the Legislature (which during his tenure had one chamber controlled by the Republicans).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The revenue secretary collects the taxes and issues reports on the state&#39;s financial health, and the subjects and rates of taxation are set by state law,&quot; said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. &quot;Policies dealing with economic and community development, jobs programs, taxes and other recession-fighting measures are handled by the governor and the Legislature.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., agreed that the ad assigned too much responsibility for setting tax policy to Wolf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The claims in this ad are really loose, and as is the case in almost all negative ads, very lacking in context,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Was Wolf culpable in killing 100,000 Pennsylvania jobs?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find a basis for the ad&rsquo;s claim that 100,000 Pennsylvania jobs were lost during Wolf&rsquo;s tenure. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed Pennsylvanians rose by 150,000 between April 2007 and November 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the problem with this part of the claim is that it&rsquo;s a stretch to blame taxes in general -- much less Wolf specifically -- for the loss of these jobs (especially their &quot;killing,&quot; in the ad&rsquo;s overheated rhetoric).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, how much straight-line causation we can draw between tax policy and those job losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Basically none,&quot; Sinclair said, saying the much bigger factor during that period was the national economic downturn, which officially became a recession almost halfway through Wolf&rsquo;s tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While she acknowledged that tax policy can affect job growth, Sinclair added that &quot;economists disagree wildly on the &lsquo;job-killing&rsquo; effects of taxes. So, confidently drawing any line of causation is impossible. And throw in that the entire country lost about 2.3 million jobs over that period. I don&#39;t think it was the high taxes of Pennsylvania that caused the job losses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corbett&rsquo;s ad claimed that &quot;on Wolf&rsquo;s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad has a point that Wolf, as a Rendell appointee, did at times give rhetorical support to some of the governor&rsquo;s proposed tax hikes (as well as some proposed tax reductions). But the ad exaggerates the influence that Wolf, as the operational head of the state&rsquo;s tax-collection department, had on crafting tax policy. Most of the state&rsquo;s tax structure was set long before he took office, and most of his job was to carry out tax laws, not craft them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the ad suggests that taxes are to blame for the job losses on his watch, when in fact Wolf&rsquo;s time in office coincided with the start of the national economic downturn -- a much more plausible reason for rising unemployment. We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-02T13:02:35.013087", "ruling_date": "2014-05-02T15:20:22", "ruling_headline": "Pennsylvania Gov.
