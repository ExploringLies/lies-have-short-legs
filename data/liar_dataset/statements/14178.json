Keefover wrote that through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Environmental Protection Agency, the society drew reports of four other Texans exposed to sodium cyanide, none fatally, all in connection with M-44s, from 1998 into 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keefover also noted an April 20, 2017, National Geographic news story stating that according to the EPA, &quot;an average of 30,000 M-44s, deployed by the federal government in concert with Western states and counties, are triggered each year. Baited to entice animals, they&rsquo;re indiscriminate in their victims,&quot; the story said. Also noted: Wildlife Services reporting that in 2016, 12,511 of 76,963 coyotes killed for livestock protection were felled with M-44s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, Keefover noted, a March 2017 incident resulted in a boy and his dog briefly getting exposed to an M-44&rsquo;s contents.
