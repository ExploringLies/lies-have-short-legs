Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, agreed to revisit his bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the meantime, we wondered: Has the declining drinking rate of Florida&rsquo;s minors really dropped as much as Pitman said? (We considered checking whether Florida&rsquo;s decline made it a &quot;leader&quot; among states, but we backed off after we learned that the state and <a href=\"http://www.monitoringthefuture.org//pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2014.pdf\">national numbers</a> -- which also are on the decline --&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t precisely comparable.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pitman, who also serves as executive director of Jacksonville-based Drug Free Duval, told PolitiFact Florida that she got her talking point from the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/samh/publications/fysas/2014Survey/2014%20FYSAS%20State%20Report%20(Final%20v2).pdf\">Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey</a>. That&rsquo;s an annual questionnaire given to middle and high school students in order to collect data about risky behaviors, such as smoking and drug use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey is coordinated by the state departments of Children and Families, Education, Health, Juvenile Justice and the Governor&#39;s Office of Drug Control. The 2014 report is drawn from answers from almost 70,000 Florida students from all 67 counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several questions measuring alcohol use, including binge drinking and whether kids have <em>ever </em>tried alcohol. But in the category Pitman cites -- the percentage of children who had used alcohol during the past 30 days -- the data show a distinct decrease over the last decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none; width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Grade</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>2004</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>2014</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Decline, 2004-2014</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Middle schoolers</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>20.3 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>10.1 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>10.2 points</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>High schoolers</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>42.0 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>28.4 percent</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>13.6 points</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a double-digit drop for both categories, providing strong evidence for Pitman&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only caveat is that there&rsquo;s a different data set that leads to slightly different results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undertakes a survey for the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/factsheets/index.htm\">Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System</a>.

The 2013 data was culled from more than 13,000 forms filled out in schools across the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CDC survey doesn&rsquo;t offer 30-day alcohol data for middle schoolers, but it does for high schoolers. For Florida, the survey found that between 2003 and 2013, alcohol use by high schoolers during the previous 30 days dropped from 42.7 percent to 34.8 percent. That&rsquo;s a decline of a little under 8 percentage points -- a bit shy of a double-digit drop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pitman said Florida has seen &quot;double-digit drops&quot;
