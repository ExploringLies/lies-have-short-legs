Sanders have each pledged to allow for refinancing of college loan debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What they, and apparently Bill Clinton, are talking about is refinancing federally backed student loans, which account for <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/total-federal-and-nonfederal-loans-over-time\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>about 90 percent</u></a> of all student borrowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to the nonprofit college planning group American Student Assistance for some advice. They and other groups say federal student loans can be refinanced into private loans. But doing so can remove federal protections such as fixed interest rates and the ability to pause repayments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, private student loans can be refinanced into new lower-interest private loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s no provision in federal law allowing the refinancing of a federal loan to another, lower-interest federal loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no federal refinancing. Congress sets the interest rate for federal student loans, and most of these rates are fixed by law, no matter how solid your credit or income becomes post-graduation,&quot; American Student Assistance <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2015/04/29/4-things-to-think-about-when-refinancing-student-loans\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>advises</u></a> potential borrowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Texas <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jun/09/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-equates-average-student-loan-debt-pri/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>examined a similar claim</u></a> in 2014 and rated it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They spoke with <a href=\"http://askheatherjarvis.com/about\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Heather Jarvis</a>, a North Carolina attorney specializing in student loan law, who told them some graduates may be able to refinance student loans at lower rates through private lenders. But, she said, this would only happen in cases in which borrowers have substantial income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jarvis added that &quot;refinancing federal loans with a private loan is risky. &nbsp;The borrower gives up important protections that accompany federal loans (like flexible repayment and discharge provisions).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students repaying federally backed loans, Jarvis said, are effectively barred from refinancing opportunities because federal law makes no provision for the government to make such offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about the former president&rsquo;s statement, Bill Clinton&rsquo;s press secretary said in an email &quot;it&rsquo;s very safe to say that the vast majority of students with debt have federal<strong> </strong>debt.&quot; She pointed to <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/total-federal-and-nonfederal-loans-over-time\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>statistics from the College Board</u></a> showing federal loans account for about 90 percent of student borrowing. She said a small percentage of borrowers can refinance a federal student loan by making it a private loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former President Bill Clinton said at a recent campaign rally in Los Angeles: &quot;A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Borrowers of federally backed student loans, which account for about 90 percent of student loans, cannot refinance those into lower-interest federal loans. Congress sets the interest rate on these loans, and there&rsquo;s no provision in federal law that allows for them to be refinanced. Depending on factors such as income, some borrowers can refinance their federal loans into lower-interest private loans, though they risk losing their federal loan protections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton most likely was referring only to federally backed loans when he made his statement, but a clarification about private loans would have helped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(63, 99, 158); transition: color 0.15s ease-in-out, border 0.15s ease-in-out; text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;more</a>&nbsp;on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-05T18:30:07.978616", "ruling_date": "2016-04-06T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Bill Clinton\u2019s Claim That College Loans Can't Be Refinanced Is Mostly True", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-clintons-college-debt-claim-mostly-true", "ruling_link_text": "Claim is correct for about 90 percent of student loans", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd73FquO1L0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>YouTube video</u></a>, Former President Bill Clinton, Los Angeles campaign speech, April 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Angel Urena, Press Secretary, Office of President Clinton, April 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Texas, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jun/09/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-equates-average-student-loan-debt-pri/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Average student loan debt in Texas close to price of a pickup truck, though privately taken student loans can be refinanced</u></a>,&quot; June 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Student Assistance, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2015/04/29/4-things-to-think-about-when-refinancing-student-loans\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>4 Things to Think About When Refinancing Student Loans</u></a>,&quot; April 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equal Justice Works<em>, &quot;</em><a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2011/07/06/consider-benefits-of-federal-student-loans\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Consider Benefits of Federal Student Loans</u></a>,&quot; July 6, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/06/11/elizabeth-warrens-bill-to-refinance-student-loans-dies-in-senate-now-what/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s bill to refinance student loans dies in the Senate.
