Bruce Rauner that quotes from several papers about Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker, including one from Rockford that declares &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i80iIakqTSw\">the main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes.</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Pritzker is punching back with his own <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&amp;v=An23OlTqaf0\">TV ad</a> that accuses Rauner of distorting the quotes he is appropriating. &quot;When you&rsquo;re a failure, you lie,&quot; a narrator says in the Pritzker spot. &quot;Bruce Rauner is intentionally misquoting newspapers to lie about J.B. Pritzker.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dueling ads go down a rabbit hole of election-year politics where there&rsquo;s now an argument about the argument. Rauner&rsquo;s ad clearly takes liberties in seeking to paint Pritzker with a broad brush as an advocate of sweeping tax hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Pritzker claims Rauner goes far beyond that by straying into outright fabrication. That&rsquo;s a provocative charge that invites a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Critical context</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes,&quot; the first quotation in Rauner&rsquo;s ad reads, attributed to <a href=\"http://www.rrstar.com/news/20180407/chuck-sweeny-its-time-for-pritzker-to-unveil-tax-plan\">the Rockford Register Star</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;An immediate increase in the current 4.95 percent flat tax rate,&quot; the second line goes on, this time from <a href=\"http://www.news-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2018-04-08/editorial-pritzker-puts-tax-issue-table.html\">the Champaign News-Gazette</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A short-term plan and a long-term plan to increase income taxes,&quot; the next line reads, also from the News-Gazette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven quotations later, the ad concludes with its sole original line: &quot;J.B. Pritzker and Mike Madigan. Higher taxes. More corruption.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked the entire string of cited articles and located the quoted lines in all of them. So it&rsquo;s clear Rauner isn&rsquo;t pulling words out of thin air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Pritzker&rsquo;s campaign to explain how Rauner erred, spokesman Jason Rubin wrote in an email that the ad &quot;misquotes articles by repeating lines out of context and in a way that misrepresents J.B.&rsquo;s vision for putting Illinois back on track.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For support, Rubin pointed to passages in some of the same articles cited by Rauner that nod to Pritzker&rsquo;s very different view of his tax stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pritzker has said, and the articles point out, that he wants to amend the Illinois Constitution so the state&rsquo;s current flat-rate income tax can be replaced with a graduated income tax allowing for higher rates on the wealthy &mdash; how much, <a href=\"https://capitolfax.com/2018/08/23/pritzker-refuses-to-say-how-much-new-revenue-hell-need-from-tax-hike-so-heres-my-initial-guesstimate/\">he won&rsquo;t say</a>. Any such effort would take several years to accomplish, so in the interim Pritzker also says he would raise the current 4.95 percent flat-tax rate but offset the increased cost for low and middle-income taxpayers with expanded exemptions and deductions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated scenario, and Rauner&rsquo;s ad ignores all the nuance by suggesting Pritzker seeks to raise taxes across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the Rauner ad is packed with sweeping condemnations of Pritzker&rsquo;s tax plan &mdash; among them that it <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-lllinois-exodus-graduated-tax-20180427-story.html\">&quot;would punish many Illinoisans&quot;</a> &mdash; ripped accurately from <a href=\"https://www.bnd.com/opinion/editorials/article210769304.html\">editorials</a> that unambiguously criticize the Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2017/dec/14/bruce-rauner/rauner-distorts-dems-message-illinois-income-tax/\">As we&rsquo;ve pointed out before,</a> implementing a graduated income tax would not necessarily mean raising taxes on the middle class, despite what Rauner and some of his editorial sources contend. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the governor is inaccurately quoting others who make that argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Pot, meet kettle</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pritzker would be on firmer ground had he merely accused Rauner of taking liberties. But there&rsquo;s a big difference between strategically selecting advantageous lines and putting words in someone&rsquo;s mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if Pritzker is going to call Rauner out for cherry-picking, it&rsquo;s also relevant to note that Pritzker does the same in his own response ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes Rauner to task for failing to point out that a Rockford Register Star opinion column he references also mentions Pritzker&rsquo;s argument that he &quot;only wants to raise taxes on wealthy people.&quot; But the overall tenor of the Rockford piece clearly <a href=\"http://www.rrstar.com/news/20180407/chuck-sweeny-its-time-for-pritzker-to-unveil-tax-plan\">takes a skeptical view</a> of Pritzker&rsquo;s tax plan, likely why Rauner chose to highlight it in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kent Redfield, a state campaign expert at the University of Illinois&rsquo; Institute of Government &amp; Public Affairs, called &quot;misquoting&quot; a poor word choice on Pritzker&rsquo;s part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It isn&rsquo;t that Rauner has lied,&quot; Redfield said. &quot;One isn&rsquo;t misquoting and the other quoting accurately. They&rsquo;re both selectively choosing things that reinforce and lend journalistic credibility to their argument.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pritzker&rsquo;s ad says Rauner &quot;is misquoting newspapers&quot; to lie about him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rauner&rsquo;s ad selectively quotes from newspapers &mdash; mostly editorials &mdash; to reinforce a disputed narrative that Pritzker is out to broadly hike taxes on Illinoisans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In doing so, Rauner leaves out a key point acknowledged in the articles that his ad cites: Pritzker says he only wants to raise taxes on wealthier individuals. The Democrat&rsquo;s campaign argues this means Rauner&rsquo;s ad is &quot;misquoting&quot; those articles by taking them out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But most of the ad&rsquo;s driving excerpts come from editorials or opinion columns that share Rauner&rsquo;s dim view of Pritzker&rsquo;s tax policies. The position advanced by Rauner&rsquo;s ad clearly matches the harsher editorials that frame it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Pritzker&rsquo;s statement contains an element of truth, it ignores this critical fact. We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-08-31T15:16:19.418644", "ruling_date": "2018-09-02T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Pritzker claims Rauner misquoted newspapers to lie about him.
