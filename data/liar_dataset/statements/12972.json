Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the &lsquo;Trump Effect.&rsquo; They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Clinton is right teachers are reporting an increase in bullying and harassment and if so, what does it have to do with Trump?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s source is an <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/splc_the_trump_effect.pdf\">April report out of the Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, a civil rights and antidiscrimination advocacy group. The report is titled &quot;The Trump Effect: The impact of the presidential campaign on our nation&rsquo;s schools.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center conducted an online survey of approximately 2,000 K-12 teachers and found: &quot;Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While their findings correspond directly with Clinton&rsquo;s claim, it&rsquo;s important to note that this was not a scientific survey, as the report notes. The respondents don&rsquo;t represent a random sample of teachers, and it&rsquo;s likely that those who chose to respond to the survey are those who are most concerned about the campaign&rsquo;s impact on students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means it would be inaccurate to extrapolate from the survey that bullying and harassment are generally on the rise across the country. Rather, it is more a collection of teachers&rsquo; anecdotal experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked for a scientific study that speaks to this same question but couldn&rsquo;t find one, mostly because there tends to be a lag in this kind of data, meaning data on bullying trends in 2016 won&rsquo;t get published until 2017 or later. The process of setting up and getting approval to conduct a scientific study is lengthy and cumbersome, and would not be approved before the election, said Sheri Bauman, a professor at the University of Arizona who researches bullying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, Bauman said the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s report should not be dismissed, as its data show important recurring themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some interesting details from the survey. Keep in mind that the survey did not mention any candidate names whatsoever:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Respondents gave a total of 5,000 comments. Of those, one in five mentioned Trump. All other candidates were mentioned fewer than 200 times combined.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;More than one-third have observed an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;Teachers report that students have been &lsquo;emboldened&rsquo; to use slurs, engage in name-calling and make inflammatory statements toward each other,&quot; and &quot;Kids use the names of candidates as pejoratives to taunt each other.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>&quot;More than two-thirds of the teachers reported that students &mdash; mainly immigrants, children of immigrants and Muslims &mdash; have expressed concerns or fears about what might happen to them or their families after the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>On the otherhand, the bullying can be contrary to the depiction that Clinton offered. The survey&nbsp;also noted examples of students getting bullied by others because they or their parents support Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The findings support Clinton&rsquo;s claim, said Maureen Costello, the report&rsquo;s author and director of the center&rsquo;s Teaching Tolerance project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s fair to say the reports say teachers who respond to us are in fact seeing an increase in the quantity of harassment and change in quality of bullying,&quot; Costello said, adding that she has received upwards of 300 unsolicited additional comments from educators since the report came out, all expressing similar sentiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I suspect (Clinton) might be right, but the data are not there to support the statement from a scientific-evidence-based perspective,&quot; said Dorothy Espelage, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana&ndash;Champaign and a leading expert in bullying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Trump spokesman dismissed the survey, noting that it was unscientific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the &lsquo;Trump Effect.&rsquo; They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center study reported an increase in bullying and harassment, particularly involving anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. Many of these teachers, unsolicited, cited Trump&rsquo;s campaign rhetoric and the accompanying discourse as the likely reason for this behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term Trump Effect is a product of the survey&rsquo;s authors. And the survey is unscientific because it&#39;s&nbsp;based on anecdotal reports. But experts in bullying told us the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s survey and their sense of current trends in schools supports Clinton&rsquo;s point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/79685d56-6956-4e5e-8e24-60a56a099c5b\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/79685d56-6956-4e5e-8e24-60a56a099c5b</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-26T15:13:46.693319", "ruling_date": "2016-08-26T17:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton, citing 'Trump Effect,' says teachers are reporting more bullying in schools", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-citing-trump-effect-says-teachers-", "ruling_link_text": "Teachers reported 'Trump Effect' in survey", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Southern Poverty Law Center, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/splc_the_trump_effect.pdf\">The Trump Effect: The impact of the presidential campaign on our nation&rsquo;s schools</a>,&quot; April 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/us/politics/donald-trump-talking-to-your-kids.html?_r=0\">The Parent-Child Discussion That So Many Dread: Donald Trump,</a>&quot; March 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Clinton&nbsp;spokesman Josh Schwerin, Aug. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails, Trump spokesman Dan Kowalski, Aug. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview, SPLC Teaching Tolerance Director Maureen Costello, Aug. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Sheri Bauman, counseling professor at the University of Arizona, Aug. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Dorothy Espelage, educational psychology professor at the University of Illinois, Aug. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Jan Urbanski, director of Safe and Humane Schools within the Institute on Family &amp; Neighborhood Life at Clemson University, Aug. 26, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the &lsquo;Trump Effect.&rsquo; They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims&nbsp;and immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "remarks in Reno", "statement_date": "2016-08-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
