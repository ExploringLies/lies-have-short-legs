Dean Heller, R-Nev., argued that his leading Democratic opponent wants to take away tax cuts for working families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heller&rsquo;s campaign announced its latest attack on Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., in a press release on tax filing day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Heller campaign releases new digital ad on Jacky Rosen&rsquo;s reckless promise to repeal middle-class tax cut,&quot; the campaign wrote on <a href=\"https://www.deanheller.com/heller-campaign-releases-new-digital-ad-jacky-rosens-reckless-promise-repeal-middle-class-tax-cut/\">April 17</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/PTtgT2w-jUo\">The Heller campaign ad</a> consists mainly of broadcast clips of reporters giving examples of companies that announced bonuses and raises for workers. But it closes by saying Rosen &quot;wants the tax bill repealed,&quot; and includes a clip of a newscaster saying &quot;Nevada Congresswoman Jacky Rosen wants the recently passed GOP tax bill repealed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Heller campaign said that report was about a Las Vegas event held by the advocacy group Not One Penny. The event was part of a nationwide protest against the Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Rosen participated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group billed the <a href=\"https://repealthetrumptax.org/\">national action</a> as the &quot;Repeal the Trump Tax Tour,&quot; saying the new tax law &quot;will raise taxes for 92 million middle-class families, rip health care away from 13 million people, and threaten life-saving programs &mdash; all to give tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-would-cut-taxes-average-1600-2018-most-benefits-going-those-making-300000-plus\">Tax Policy Center</a>, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018, but those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its stop in Las Vegas on Jan. 15, 2018, the group called on Republicans to &quot;repeal the Trump Tax on middle-class Families,&quot; as the group&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://notonepenny.org/monday-congresswoman-jacky-rosen-to-join-state-senator-yvanna-cancela-and-assemblywoman-sandra-jauregui-for-press-conference-slamming-the-trumptaxs-disastrous-effects-on-nevada-families/\">press release</a> put it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We watched the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/taxmarch/videos/385719945200860/\">full video of the event</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosen left no room for doubt that she opposed the Republican tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This tax bill at its core is a giveaway to special interests and the wealthy,&quot; Rosen said. &quot;And it will disadvantage millions of working families in the long run. In 10 years, by 2027, more than half of all Americans will pay more in their tax bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosen said the bill was &quot;out of balance,&quot; but stopped short of calling for full repeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We must come together to use common sense to fix this reckless tax bill and protect our families against long-term damage,&quot; Rosen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the news report quoted in the Heller ad said she called for repeal, Rosen herself didn&rsquo;t say that. A search of the Nexis news database and of Rosen&rsquo;s Twitter accounts reveals no mention. Nor could the Heller campaign provide any examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said, &quot;Rosen never made it a point to say she just wanted to change part of it and keep other parts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2018/03/27/hellers-tax-bill-corporate-giveaway-rosen/460816002/\">March 27 op-ed</a>, Rosen said she supports middle-class tax cuts and chastised Heller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Sen. Heller and Republicans had really wanted to give a tax cut to working families, why not give them a bigger, permanent tax cut directly instead of relying on trickle-down economics?&quot; she wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Heller said that Rosen promised to repeal middle-class tax cuts. The Republican tax law provides immediate tax relief to middle-class families, though those savings expire without further action for all but the highest earners. Rosen spoke at an event that called for repeal of what they called the &quot;Trump Tax&quot; on the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Rosen said the law should be fixed; she did not say it should be repealed. As a point of policy, both Rosen and the organizers of the event where she spoke support middle-class tax cuts, but not the package passed by Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s some nuance here, but Rosen didn&rsquo;t vow to repeal the current tax law. We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2018-04-23T12:31:37.112959", "ruling_date": "2018-04-24T09:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Middle-class tax cuts as weapon in Nevada Senate race", "ruling_headline_slug": "middle-class-tax-cuts-weapon-nevada-senate-race", "ruling_link_text": "Taxes the truth", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Heller for Senate, <a href=\"https://www.deanheller.com/heller-campaign-releases-new-digital-ad-jacky-rosens-reckless-promise-repeal-middle-class-tax-cut/\">Press release</a>, April 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heller for Senate, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PTtgT2w-jUo\">Repeal</a>, April 17, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not One Penny, <a href=\"https://notonepenny.org/monday-congresswoman-jacky-rosen-to-join-state-senator-yvanna-cancela-and-assemblywoman-sandra-jauregui-for-press-conference-slamming-the-trumptaxs-disastrous-effects-on-nevada-families/\">Congresswoman Jacky Rosen to Join State Senator Yvanna Cancela and Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui For Press Conference Slamming the TrumpTax&rsquo;s Disastrous Effects on Nevada Families</a>, Jan. 12, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax March, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/taxmarch/videos/385719945200860/\">Las Vegas</a>, Jan. 15, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-would-cut-taxes-average-1600-2018-most-benefits-going-those-making-300000-plus\">The TCJA Would Cut Taxes By An Average of $1,600 in 2018, With Most Benefits Going To Those Making $300,000-Plus</a>, Dec. 18, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Reno Gazette Journal</em>, <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2018/03/27/hellers-tax-bill-corporate-giveaway-rosen/460816002/\">Heller&#39;s tax bill a corporate giveaway: Rosen</a>, March 27, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/09/blog-posting/did-nancy-pelosi-vow-raise-taxes-if-democrats-take/\">Did Nancy Pelosi vow to raise taxes if Democrats take the U.S. House?</a>, April 9, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Keith Schipper, spokesman, Dean Heller for Senate, April 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Stewart Boss, spokesman, Jacky Rosen for Senate, April 20, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Dean", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 4286, "last_name": "Heller", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "dean-heller", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Heller_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4286/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Jacky Rosen promised &quot;to repeal middle-class tax cut.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign ad press release", "statement_date": "2018-04-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Middle-class tax cuts as weapon in Nevada senate race"}
