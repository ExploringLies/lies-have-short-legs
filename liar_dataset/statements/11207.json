Geist then asked Dean how he would feel about a Republican doing what Clinton did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Howard, is it fair to say if this were a Republican secretary of state, and someone you were not supporting for president,&quot; asked Geist, &quot;you would be troubled by a secretary of state having a private email server in his or her home?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&quot; Dean replied, cutting Geist off, &quot;because I used to do that as governor, and I know there&rsquo;s a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geist followed up, &quot;And would only use a private server for State Department emails?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean demurred, saying whatever she was done was within the constraints of the law at the time.&nbsp;(Whether Clinton violated State Department protocols or the law is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jul/29/four-pressing-questions-about-hillary-clintons-sta/\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: transparent; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; font-size: 20px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(63, 99, 158); transition: color 0.15s ease-in-out, border 0.15s ease-in-out; text-decoration: none;\">unclear</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to check Dean&rsquo;s claim that he used a private server during his days in office and that the practice is widespread among politicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dean&rsquo;s emails</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/08/08/us/politics/emails_keyevents.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>drawn criticism</u></a> for conducting government business through an email address privately hosted on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., instead of through the State Department&#39;s system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On&nbsp;<em>Morning Joe</em>,&nbsp;Dean equated&nbsp;her actions with his own, as well as a &quot;tremendous&quot; other number of officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we looked into Dean&rsquo;s record for insight into his past email practices.&nbsp;We reached out to Dean through Democracy for America, the grassroots organizing group he founded, but didn&rsquo;t get a response for the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean, who was governor of Vermont from 1991 through 2003, faced questions about his email in 2001 when a concerned citizen requested to see his correspondence with a ski resort developer, according to an <a href=\"http://www.vce.org/Act250news.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>article</u></a> in the <em>Rutland Herald</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean&rsquo;s lawyers at the time said&nbsp;the emails were exempt from release&nbsp;because they were conducted through the governor&rsquo;s private account. The article also mentions that Dean used neither a government-issued email address nor the computer supplied to him by the state.&nbsp;Vermont state archivist Tanya Marshall said Dean&rsquo;s administration did not transfer any emails to the state records office at the end of his tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Dean clearly used a private email account while he was governor. But we could find no evidence that he used a private server as well. And there&#39;s a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, only one other politician is on record as doing the same: Clinton&rsquo;s Republican&nbsp;presidential rival Jeb Bush.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Florida governor from 1999 to 2007, Bush <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/07/jeb-bush-scott-walker-hillary-clinton-private-emails\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>used a private server</u></a> for both his <a href=\"http://jebemails.com/home\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>personal email</u></a> account and the accounts of some of his staffers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Account vs. server</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hillary-clinton-email-escapades-muckreads\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Many politicians</u></a> use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton had in her basement are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there&rsquo;s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>elaborate setup</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other presidential candidates,&nbsp;Louisiana Gov.

Powell, however, did not operate his own server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of discussing Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s private email server for handling government business, Dean said, &quot;I used to do that as governor, and I know there&rsquo;s a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that Dean was trying to say that many public officials have used private email accounts. But by failing to mention that Clinton also set up her own server, he completely misses the point of Geist&rsquo;s question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides Clinton, Jeb Bush is the only other official who used a personal server during his time in office.
